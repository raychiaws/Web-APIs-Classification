1,jayakodi123,t2_3atafxt9,"Ma’am / sir, I’m jayakodi from Salem . Tamilnadu. I have been facing dowry harassment for past 12 years. I was able to manage past 10years with the dowry money given to me. My father passed away a year before my marriage.  I Have a y. Sis and y. Brother. From the time of marriage we were living with the dowry money given to me. Even marriage expenditures were all borne by my mother. They just came married n took me to their house. They were asking my mother to split the property equally to three kids but my mom said that she will give 50L for each girl n property for the son. So from the beginning I was subject to lots of demands n in a week of marriage we were pushed out of house coz my husband was all time with me. We were together for a year in Bangalore in my FIL own apt. I got conceived n had a baby girl. I was in mom place n without even informing me he bought all the things to his house n stored it all in there. From then lots of demands n my husband was just walking n walking off the life. Meanwhile I made to abort a baby n lots of threatenings n physical harassment by my mother in law n husband n police was also involved. Then again I got conceived n had a baby boy. Wen baby was 8months they try to file divorce without my knowledge in Bangalore court n I found n filed for conjugal n maintenance n he filed for divorce. My brother had an affair with a married lady who had 8yr old boy then manipulatively took all the property n went to her. Then my husband got the case back n he was giving 25k monthly to run the family Inclusive of rent 12k. He was fine sometimes n sometimes harassing he has hit me in front of kids n spoke vulgarly in front of my neighbors n done it all. He wears Armani, Hugo boss Ralph Lauren n drove jeta n polo. Have a farmhouse with pool , n have a very high lifestyle but me n kids were treated like slave. I was staying alone with kids n he only visited us n he was in his moms place. Last year sep to Dec I was very sick had very bad cough even puked blood n my daughter has 104 degree temp for 14 day’s inspite of continuous calls n text he never turned up. Now in this lockdown for past two months he only paid the rent n 5k for house expense. I had no choice but to move to my moms place for refugee. Now this month he stopped every support n blackmailing for divorce since I denied I have been falsely filed complaint in 2 police stations n harrased in the station. In one station I saw by myself the SI getting bribe from my FIL lawyer. I went alone but they came as a gang n were attacking me. I was not even shown the complaint copy. I am taking everything as I have no backup n my kids are dependent on me. Plz help me I want to fight I don’t want to die. I’m plz plz help me.",1592754643,fvjowgw,t1_fvj2k9j,/r/domesticviolence/comments/hd4uuf/plz_plz_help_me/fvjowgw/,1,domesticviolence,comment

4,fuzziemuffin,t2_7lawn,"You may want to have your phone on recording any time you’re around him. If he gets violent again, you could call the police and press assault charges against him. I dont see why they would take you somewhere, you’re an adult so I dont think they’d take you to social services. If you go this route, you should have someplace safe lined up where you can stay in case he returns, but you’d at least have a few hours to get sone things together if he were to post bail the same day. Even if it doesn’t leave a mark, keep a record of every instance of abuse. Be detailed: date, time, what happened before during and after you were hit, where you were hit (with what if hit with an object), and pictures of markings, even a temporary red mark that goes away. If there are domestic violence shelters or advocate programs, try looking into what they offer for help.

8,FifiLeBean,t2_u9fjt,"\#1 get any book by Lundy Bancroft about domestic violence and read it. Your local library might have it in ebook form if they are not yet open. Do this huge thing. 

Most outside people think they know a lot and I am pretty sure their information came from a tv movie. Or worse, their opinions. hah.

I think this reddit group has resources for finding domestic violence resources in your area. 

You can tell your sister that the best thing I did was to contact the local domestic violence organization. They did not pressure me, or act like they knew better than me, did not tell me what to do (most people do that mistake), did not act like I was an idiot, did not act superior, etc. By the way, that's what abusers do, so the LAST THING you want to do is repeat that kind of behavior. It will only hinder her and that puts her at greater risk. 

I think the biggest concern I had was where to go if it got bad (here's where regular therapists are utter crap because I asked one and he didnt even realize I was serious and gave me no referrals or even safe places to go that are basic like a store or library) and how to figure out the basic financial survival. 

I was in a verbally abusive relationship that got worse and I had a good job, which I wasn't sure about financially but things did work out. But what caused much of my delays was fearing that I couldnt make it. And just not having anywhere to go (no family). Offering her a safe place to go if possible is great, even if she doesn't take it. It gives her a safety net and an option if she needs to run. I was offered a place to go and I had a bag packed. (hah, I think it is still packed!). 

Hopefully this gives you some ideas of what you can start doing now.",1592784184,fvl5wu0,t3_hdfv70,/r/domesticviolence/comments/hdfv70/domestic_violence_how_to_navigate_this_when_your/fvl5wu0/,1,domesticviolence,comment

I’m supposed that CPS hasn’t been involved here if she can’t get her shit together and leave him for good then she shouldn’t have custody over her kids period. 

I don’t know how old her kids are but the fact that they are coming to you and are literally scared for their lives is so extremely sad no child should feel this way we all deserve to have a happy and safe space where we can trust the adults to be stable and to guide us but they aren’t getting any of this.

17,kawaiithrowaway13,t2_54q75ay0,"Thank you so much for replying! 
For context the one that came to me is 9 and the other one is 5. The 5 year old see's his behavior as normal since she grew up with that. 
I'm usually with them most of the time since we live together so, they usually come to me for things. 

They've been seperated for about a year but he gets to see the kids every sunday. She has physical custody due to the severity of what he did last year. I have over 100+ texts and video proof of what he did. 

I confronted her a few hours ago. She told me the she KNOWS their relationship was toxic but they're not together since they live in separate houses and see different people etc. She said she won't make the same mistake this time, because she's not the same person she was last year. 
She told ME that I have to move on from what happened since it's clearly hurting me not him. 
(I have anxiety and depression) 

Their relationship was good at first but it slowly disintegrated throughout the years. 
I've tried everything to get her to stop talking to him but   her response was that she's almost 30 years old and she can do what she wants. That she doesn't need me to tell her anything because I have almost zero life experience to tell her what to do. 

My brother and parents have told her multiple times that if she wants to hand over the custody of the girls to either on of them she could. So she's able to run off with him.",1592803207,fvlyhtk,t1_fvlo2ot,/r/domesticviolence/comments/hdjcto/please_give_me_advice_i_honestly_dont_know_to_do/fvlyhtk/,1,domesticviolence,comment

1. I think you should tell her. Not so that she will feel safer but so that it is not a secret between you guys, if she were to find out some other way and then learn that you knew and didn’t share she might feel betrayed. 

2. Another reason I think you should tell your girlfriend is so that you can consult with her about this. There are legal means by which you might be able to help but that’s only if his new gf wants help, you can’t help someone that doesn’t want to leave their abuser.

43,ouelletouellet,t2_powswyc,"First off it’s always a really bad warning sign when a 44 year old goes after a younger woman especially of your age while legally it’s not wrong he’s preyed on you just for that your young and quit possibly naive ( I’m not try to be rude just honest) and considering maybe your slight immaturity and your overall kindness he took advantage of you. 

I would seriously confide ending things and packing up and leaving he is dangerous I can guarantee the next thing that will happen will be you dead in a body bag. 

Not only has he actually been physically violent he’s told you multiple times that he’s willing and capable of killing you possibly with his own bare hands that’s not something someone who’s stable says to their lover that’s a big red flag.

I would also really think about the fact that If you stay with this guy if you have children with him they’d be just as much in danger as you are that’s not what you want. 

Your young and you have every chance and opportunities to find someone who will love you and never lay their hands on you if it seems impossible think about what you want in a partner when you have goal and determination anything is possible please don’t wait till your dead because it doesn’t have to be this way. 

To many times woman have let themselves justify their partners actions but no it’s not okay there’s no reason for someone harming another human being

But, if you read the stories of other people who have gone through similar abuse. Or you read about the ways abusers justify their actions, you will see he is acting just like any other abuser acts. This isn't how people play around with someone they love and care about. You should be able to tell your partner how he is and is not allowed to treat you without fear of him harming you further.

Thank you for this. I do understand people may get frustrated or stressed and snap at their partner and then feel bad, but for us it's like it's not even happening during stressful moments. It's just random, out of the blue, during normal conversations. And it just makes me start to feel like am I just that annoying? Am I that hard to be around? What am I doing/saying that makes him so frustrated with me? I feel like he makes an effort to work on it but the results aren't long-lasting and it starts to make me feel like I have to walk on eggshells or think hard about how to say something so he doesn't react like that.

61,julbr84,t2_560g6e0y,"This is exactly why women stay with abusers. It’s confusing and insidiously manipulative until you don’t know right from wrong or up from down and it ALWAYS gets worse. 

My best advice, as you come to terms with this situation, is to write down every incident. Date. Time. “Why” (there’s never an excuse, I mean more what triggered the incident) and how it made you feel. 

As the list grows, you’ll begin to see the patterns and he will lose his power to confuse you into believing it wasn’t “that bad” or it was a “joke.” The longer the list grows, the more you’ll see that he doesn’t change for long, (and the cycle of how he “changes” when he’s feeling guilty, then reverts back.) it makes you stronger, doesn’t allow you to dismiss or forget it all (which is a survival mechanism many people develop) 

If you’re in a position to do so, I strongly suggest a therapist (that he doesn’t know about) so that his influence over you cannot brainwash you completely, so you have a calm, impartial voice to give it to you straight and guide you to your own conclusions. 

I am so sorry. I know how hard it is, and how confusing it feels, how much you doubt yourself and how desperately you want to believe that he will change. 

Mine didn’t. It only ever got worse and worse. I was broken, brainwashed, traumatized. It took years to work up the courage to leave and years to heal. But since then I have found a new relationship. He never screams at me. He hears me out, never tells me what to do. He respects my feelings, has never belittled me. And most importantly, he doesn’t change personalities when he’s mad. He doesn’t ever ( and will never- because I won’t ever allow it again ) put his hands on me in any way but love. He never intimidates or threatens me. And he’s had to put up with a lot as I healed and learned to trust men again, even the good ones.  I still marvel that this type of relationship is even possible- one that is HEALTHY and supportive. And I’m telling you this because I need you to know that better is out there. Not all men do that horrible abusive sadistic stuff. I need everyone who reads this to hear that again- not. All. Men. Do. That. 

Again, I’m sorry. I know how confusing and hard these things are.",1592706530,fvi1ggo,t3_hctcpj,/r/domesticviolence/comments/hctcpj/why_is_it_so_difficult_to_see_it_as_abusive/fvi1ggo/,1,domesticviolence,comment

64,julbr84,t2_560g6e0y,"Yes. 

That is abuse.

I’m sorry, i know how hard it is. 

Everyone is always free to try couples therapy, I never suggest against it. Sometimes people have issues they need to work through, sometimes people need help to communicate better. 

But either way, since you’re already considering it, start planning how you would leave right now. You have children so it’s complicated. If you’re a SAHM you’d need money he can’t cut off, a place to go. If he’s prone to physical outbursts, and depending on the laws in your state, you kicking him out is probably not the safest plan (if he’s legally entitled to the residence), you need to be able to leave if and when you decide. If you need to squirrel away money, start doing it (I used to get $10/20 cash back at grocery stores where the extra money on the bill wouldn’t raise any suspicions). There are a lot of advocates out there and resources for women, do your research. 

It’s better to have a plan you never use than it is to suddenly be completely desperate and lost. 

I don’t know you, but you deserve better. And your children don’t deserve to grow up witnessing abusive behavior- they won’t know any better, your relationship will be their guide for what “love” looks like. 

And if you love him and believe it can work, tell him exactly what behaviors you will not allow, Demand counseling, and stick to your guns. If he can’t change, he leaves you no choice.

When you stay, when you allow it, it always gets worse.",1592707310,fvi2pfw,t3_hcsgjm,/r/domesticviolence/comments/hcsgjm/is_my33f_husband34m_verballyemotionally_abusing/fvi2pfw/,1,domesticviolence,comment

Second option, apply for jobs working for one of the concessionaires in the National Parks. The two big ones are Delaware North and Xanterra. They have jobs in many if the major National Parks. Those jobs often have low cost housing options. The jobs are mostly service jobs, but it’s a way to get out safely. Added bonus, you will be among people your own age, many of whom will be coming from similar situations.

128,julbr84,t2_560g6e0y,"First and foremost: you are entitled to your feelings. Always. If his actions hurt you, he does not get to tell you how you “should” feel. 

While stress brings out the worst in most of us, snapping at people doesn’t show respect or compassion, which a partner should absolutely show. Taking things out on others is part human nature, part massive personality flaw. We all have the tendency to be short tempered at times, but if it is becoming a constant issue and seriously affecting you and he doesn’t respect your inability to just “brush it off” then yes, in my opinion, as a DV escapee/survivor, that is [at the very least borderline] abusive. 

He needs to work on managing his stress so that he doesn’t take it out on you. And he must work on accepting and respecting your feelings, whether he understands them or not. One person should not dictate when the other should get over something. That is not indicative of empathy or love, it’s incredibly dismissive and controlling.

Misbehaving followed by “apologizing” while still blaming your victim for your behavior is not a genuine apology, it’s a big red flag. 

Disarm his defensiveness by asking what he’s feeling and why he’s so stressed, and if there’s anything you can do to help him (aka show love and compassion). But at the very same time you must Stand up for yourself. Make it clear that you will not tolerate being treated like that. There’s always compromise and forgiveness in relationships, but if he keeps doing the same thing and sort of apologizing and not changing, I worry things will get worse. Essentially he gets away with bad behavior. 

He shouldn’t be upset with you for calling his behavior abusive. He should be upset with himself for behaving in a way that could be described as abuse. He’s flipping it on you, making you feel bad, confusing you. 


I’m sorry you’re going through this. It hurts, I know all about it. The best advice I can give is- don’t allow it.",1592612056,fve53ob,t3_hcbfp4,/r/domesticviolence/comments/hcbfp4/is_this_verbal_or_emotional_abuse_or_am_i/fve53ob/,2,domesticviolence,comment

130,throwawayyy654765,t2_6zd0zopf,"Thank you for this. I do understand people may get frustrated or stressed and snap at their partner and then feel bad, but for us it's like it's not even happening during stressful moments. It's just random, out of the blue, during normal conversations. And it just makes me start to feel like am I just that annoying? Am I that hard to be around? What am I doing/saying that makes him so frustrated with me? I feel like he makes an effort to work on it but the results aren't long-lasting and it starts to make me feel like I have to walk on eggshells or think hard about how to say something so he doesn't react like that. He always apologizes but it doesn't feel genuine when it keeps happening. I do feel like things are minimized and idk just can't grasp my mind around why. Like he got all hurt when I said I feel like it's abusive, but he also said, ""Do you want me to show you abuse?"" to which I obviously said no. I actually forgot all about that and like I pushed it out of my head until I started reflecting more on that day. Later when I brought that up to him instead of idk seeing how that could be intimidating to say that, he said he wasn't being serious and even if I had said yes he wouldn't have done anything and he just said that because he thought I'd drop it and do I really think he's that much of a monster. And then he listed all of the things he does for me.

My partner is the same way. He is so quick to anger, his temper so short. And I’m sick of being yelled at for no reason. I don’t deserve this, and neither do you. 

I made a list of lists:

- things I’ll need for my own apartment
- things I’ll have to do before I leave
- emotional supports I can lean on
- financial strategy 
- things I will need to feel safe and secure

I am checking items off the list every day. Eight months feels like a long time, but I think that’s when I’ll be able to leave. 

It’s exciting to think about waking up in my own bed, not having to guess what mood he’ll wake up in, to be able to go to the kitchen and make myself some tea and enjoy the peaceful quiet with my thoughts while I gaze out the window, to be able to do harmless things like leaving the frying pan on the stove for a couple hours without getting yelled at. I’ll be able to take big breaths, to think about myself, to not have my thoughts and emotions and energy monopolized by his moods constantly. No more being gaslighted. No more defending myself for calling out his verbally and emotionally abusive behavior. No more fighting. No more tension. No more anger. Just peace and ease in a home that is clean and bright and exactly as I want it.

Like I started out cool with it all till he began strangling me and getting aggressive and wierd. The more I kicked at him and struggled the worse it got like he wanted that reaction. So I kinda just started pretending I was cool with it like even bj stuff grosses me out so bad and I only did it first because I wanted to be really nice when everything seemed chill. But then it was just forceful but at least when I pretended to be into that he didn't do the other stuff as bad except kind hurt my head from grabbing it so tight and stuff. I feel so gross. But I also pretended It was fine. Maybe I thought I was all fine and this is what confident girls put up with anyway so I acted happy but I kinda puked a little after out of disgust for even letting it all happen and ""laughing"" it off before he skipped out. And cuz I have never experienced being treated that way before and I was overwhelmed I guess. But yea he never asked to do the extra scary painful stuff and everything online says that its bad not to talk about that beforehand. I did say he could do it how he liked but it was in the context if like slow or fast not strangle, slap, call me names and keep going when I pushed away way. Plus the whole pretending to lose the condom thing but kept going holding me down and didn't ask me about it till after he said it was too late or some shit. I get mistakes happen but he was remarking on it later like he knew idk. So Im going to ask Dr to get me plan b cuz my medical covers it. So thats another level embarrassing going to my local God fearing pharmacy potentially and getting that if I can.... I just played along when I couldn't push him off.

Please reach out to RAINN.org for support. Its important to talk to folks to process what you have been through because it can happen in stages and catch you off guard. You deserve that support and its exactly what its there for in the first place. So please, please, reach out for help. Im so very sorry you went through this. Your doctor is also not a judge of who you are and there is no shame in being a victim of abuse. That shame belongs to the abuser completely. If you would rather, go to the ER and talk to a nurse. You can call ahead and find out if they are a rape trauma center and have trained staff there to help you. You need to have your neck looked at because there can be serious after effects that can cause harm even when you dont think its a big deal. These folks will be strangers and not sit in judgement of you and will be able to make sure you are safe. They will not think poorly of you or that you deserved it or wanted to be raped. They will help you. Please reach out.",1592645985,fvfdebj,t1_fvf1pax,/r/domesticviolence/comments/hcgbh8/im_stupid_how_long_to_feel_better_after_minor/fvfdebj/,1,domesticviolence,comment
162,Outofsight9123,t2_6dnmfknj,I only actually said no when he was trying to force my head around to do something gross and I got out of it because I was over him more instead of under but I didn't stop him from other stuff just distracted. I think Im a good enough actress to where he thought it was fine. I kinda acted slutty at first too but he wasnt like this in the past so I never imagined it go that far. But he also knew he was the only guy I had even talked to since I last saw him 7ish years ago. Im not as experienced as maybe he thought. I pretended to be confident up to the end. Imagination is different than reality I guess. But he did know I hated that one movie so maybe thats why. I did say he could do whatever he felt but in the moment of that it was in context of going gentle or slow or little fast all nice like in normal stuff I never meant go crazy like some twisted women hating porn. He hasn't texted me since so I guess thats a good thing. Lesson learned the tough way. I thought he cared about me as a person but he didn't. I hope his tiny penis and hands get shot off on his next deployment.  Im scared of randomly dyeing now though just cuz that would be my luck. I can only get to normal clinic so hopefully I can be seen today and its quick so I can just forget this mistake and go back to being the lame nun watching cat videos making artisan soap without out a care. 🤦🏻‍♀️.,1592648396,fvffnvf,t1_fvfdebj,/r/domesticviolence/comments/hcgbh8/im_stupid_how_long_to_feel_better_after_minor/fvffnvf/,1,domesticviolence,comment

Yes, this is exactly the reaction I explained, fawn. To keep him placated. That is a real reaction to trauma. To being raped. Thats what it looks like, just what you described. You are not slutty. Having sex is not something you should be shamed for in the first place. And he didnt think you were enjoying it. Thats why he did what he did. Please get to the hospital. Trauma does not go away on its own because you dont want to deal with it or no one would be dealing with trauma and PTSD. It doesnt go away, it gets worse and can cause real lasting effects. I dont want to scare you here. I just want you to know the reality of all of this. Its not fair. Its not right. You shouldnt have to have dealt with this and you sure didnt earn it. It is however something you cannot ignore even when you want to. Many of us understand and have been in similar situations. The sooner you get help both physically and emotionally the better overall you will be. You did not deserve this, he was not mistaken, and you are worthy of respect, compassion and kindness. So please, do reach out today. RAINN.org is there 24/7 to talk to people right now, but please seek out medical care and trauma therapy if you can get to it.",1592648721,fvffz37,t1_fvffnvf,/r/domesticviolence/comments/hcgbh8/im_stupid_how_long_to_feel_better_after_minor/fvffz37/,1,domesticviolence,comment
164,Outofsight9123,t2_6dnmfknj,Thank you for being so nice. Its just hard to separate what I felt was my fault and what I felt was not and wrong. Maybe its just harder cuz I have Already been through a weird guilt feeling but logically see not completely at fault kinda situation for my first exposure to sex when way too young so its like full circle. I did get therapy for that in my mid twenties. But yea kinda complicated feeling. Im going to call my dr office at 9am and ask to get me in sooner. I think what I'm feeling might be minor but its also the first time thats ever happened to me so I cant compare. Being a hypochondriac I worry about like how they rule out if I could randomly die or be fine. I have an inflammatory condition with the blood vessels in my eyes contributing to my vision loss so I worry about any others in my body I don't know of yet like my neck. Thankfully I never passed out but was definitely a lot of scary constricting my veins and everything. I just hope the odds are in my favor. And Im going to ask for that Plan B as my insurance should cover it. My only tube might be blocked but Im not about to play with the chances there. Thanks for being nice to me. You guys are already better therapists than the one I had for a few years back in the day. I just wana be ok. Guys suck.,1592650168,fvfhd0b,t1_fvffz37,/r/domesticviolence/comments/hcgbh8/im_stupid_how_long_to_feel_better_after_minor/fvfhd0b/,1,domesticviolence,comment
165,ImYesILeffHisAss2398,t2_2egrzrvq,"Its perfectly normal that you are struggling to figure this out and want to get back to your every day self. Its just also important that you still address the serious medical issues and the trauma from this event. It will creep out of cracks and can cause some very unusual and persistent disturbing effects. Im very sorry you had a therapist that did not really help you. Please look for one that is a trauma therapist and specifically has experience to help you. Therapists are tools to use in your healing process. Its important to have the right tool for the job in order to get it done. 

The odds are in your favor because you are reaching out for help. You are putting them in your favor because you are doing whats best for you. I know it sucks. I know you want to be okay, however, there is going to be the process of healing that will take some time and some work. Put the blame for what happened on the one person who did that to you, the abuser. You dont want to think that all dudes are going to hurt you or would treat you poorly.

172,Trichcuit,t2_41cmdcrj,"I know you’ve been told this in some other comments, but I’m gonna say this anyway: You did absolutely nothing wrong. You wanted attention and affection, which is completely normal. You consented at first, but the moment you started pulling away and resisted him, you withdrew that consent. You’re allowed to change your mind, especially when you’re not comfortable. Plus, you don’t have to say “no” for it to be assault. It’s clear to everyone, including him, that you did not want and we’re not okay with what happened. 

In terms of the strangulation, if you’re willing, you absolutely need to see a doctor. If you’re in the US, there are specific exams they should do for strangulation, but you may need to see a SANE nurse to do so depending on your area. Also, strangulation is a felony and not something people can regularly consent to in some (if not most?) states.

Last, you’re not ruined by this. I understand how you feel, but you don’t have to feel the way you do. This guy does not deserve that much power over you. He doesn’t deserve to determine how you feel about this. Please discuss this with a counselor so you can start working through it.

289,EricOblair,t2_3y00xvsb,"Men can definitely face domestic violence.  I like to read the stories because it helps me out things in perspective.  

For men the issue is red flags are sometimes not as obvious.  I feel it is grey. 

Women can get angry.  Hit a man.  Yell in public.  Destroy his things.  But then it will be blamed on hormones.  If man does one of those things a woman sees a red flag and society says it is abuse and notn just part of being in a relationship.

A woman can constantly say this GS that being a man down and men will say ""well that's just women...""

Men rub the risk of not being believed by police and being recorded as the abuser.  If men are believed there is social stigma.  

For men the risk of being isolated from their kids is significant.   

I am trying to respond to toxic energy with Bob Ross energy but I am completely worn down at this point.  I really don't have the time to write my whole story here and now.

1. Cut ties with him. He sounds like a piece of shit. I would file a restraining order against him. And your family should recommend he sees a therapist.

2. Being a woman does not mean you can’t defend yourself. Go sign up for martial arts lessons. I recommend jujitsu. It does not involve striking, and for the most part favors technique over brute strength. It’s also a great confidence builder. Also as a general recommendation for everyone, I suggest you get a gun and take lessons on how to use it. The gun part may be an unpopular opinion, but you will come around if your life is ever in danger again. But seriously, with martial arts and fire arms. Training is everything. If you don’t have time to train, make time. Your life literally depends on it.

My family doesn't live in this city with me either. I thought his parents loved me, but at the end of the day, they are his family, not mine, and they would not help me.

I never told my family the reason we split up, I just told them that we did. I didn't want them to worry about me.

Don't believe him when he says things will get better. It's been almost a year since we split and my ex still barely works, still drinks, and now he's freeloading off his parents. You are a strong woman and you can do this! Getting a divorce is going to be the best thing for you and for your kids.

On one occasion he actually did drive me to the middle of nowhere and kicked me out of the car. He only picked me up again because my mother told him to (we had guests from her family that she didn't want to get involved with his anger issues). 

The one biggest mistake I made was not getting legal when it was all fresh. 10 years on and he's still trying to pass it off as discipline, I've lost a lot of family members to it and I've had to deal with agoraphobia, CPTSD and panic attacks. I don't talk to him anymore, completely NC but I'm 27 and well off without much contact from any family really. 

The only one that believes me now is my mother and that's only because my father came out about his sex addiction with prostitutes. We're the only ones that see it for what it is; a projection of guilt. Unfortunately it took too long even for her to reconcile with the fact that she wasn't there for me when I needed her most.

666,SulcataGirl,t2_2zfu43cd,"It was very very difficult for me to tell my family, so empathize.  I'd been isolated as well and felt so much guilt and shame.  Looking back I think I also realized that once I said something it would be real.  There'd be no going back from that choice.  I knew my family would beg and/or insist I leave, and I wasn't sure I could at the time.  I believed I wouldn't be able to handle that internal conflict.  After all, I was already so... broken.  I felt like a ghost of myself and don't know who I was anymore.  

A particularly bad incident where I realized I was eventually going to die on the floor or be irreperably brain damaged because he choked me *just* a bit too long started my shift.  At that point I thought my only option was death - either by his hands or mine.  I have a son.  I thought about how losing me at such a young age would affect the rest of his life.  I couldn't do that to him.  Although I was so broken that I couldn't stand up for myself, I found the strength to tell my family because I still had the willpower to help *him* (my son).

I was right.  When I told my family there was no going back.  They held me accountable, and it's exactly what I needed.  The local DV organization provided me free counseling, and the offer so many other necessary tools and can connect you to so many resources.

I know that feeling of guilt and shame, and still experience it sometimes when I think about that part of my life, but it *does* get much better.  I know who I am again.  I love and respect myself.  I've reconnected with my passions and relationships with people who really *do* love me.

This is not your fault.  If you can find the strength to open up to a trusted person (who probably already has suspicions about your situation) you'll be taking the first step towards freedom.  And this freedom, the light on the other side, is so delicious and worth it.

2.  He is gay.  Bisexuality is a real thing, but I've never heard of anyone who is bi-sexual but hetero-abussive.  That's a gay closet case who hits you because he is too chicken shit to harm himself.

3.  Go to the cops.  Gather whatever evidence you have of abuse and show them the gay stuff too.  

That will all go over poorly with strait cops, but if you're lucky one of the cops is gay and will probably lose his mind over a gay man treating women this way.  It's a problem with gay people ""coming out"" during a hetero relationship, the gay community knows the strait partner gets shit all over already, and often times there is abuse involved.  Everyone gave my gay ex wife a pass for everything, except the young lesbian crowd because they'd been out since they were teenagers, so what was my wife's excuse?

If you stay in a situation with an abuser this toxic, you'll probably end up dead or in jail because he is happy and in control which is why he created this environment.

688,FifiLeBean,t2_u9fjt,"Nope. 

I know it's not what you want to hear. Not only will it go on like this, but it will get progressively worse. 

My ex was only verbally abusive, and he did the best remorse, the best acknowledgement known to humankind. he would look me right in the eyes, say he read the Lundy Bancroft book about abusers and realized it was all true, it was him, and that he was going to get therapy, etc. he even read Bancroft's website for abusers, attended an abusers support group he got referred to from the website, started weekly therapy with the guy who ran the business for helping abusers change. He admitted to mutual friends and his family that he had a problem with anger. 

and he did not change. Not one bit. 

He pretended remorse, but it was all a big lie. He pretended to acknowledge things, but deep down, he was flat out lying. It got worse. He got more manipulative, more gaslighting, more contempt, more silent rage and silent treatment for weeks on end. 

What was missing: 

he was incapable of true remorse

he was incapable of empathy (I mistook silence as compassion)

his speeches were good enough for Hallmark movies, and he admitted on occasion that they were just acting, deep down he didn't believe he did anything wrong, etc. 

The good news is this: when he left, he took all the sh!t with him. Not one bit of it was mine. He got to walk away with all the anger, rage, and mess.There was not one thing more I could have done to improve anything, had anybody else been who he was with, this outcome would have been the same. He left in December 2019, I just saw him yesterday to deal with a legal matter for the divorce. He looks terrible. He looks bitter and angry. He was illogical and petulant. 

I looked great. I was grounded. I was well. 

Lundy Bancroft books were immensely helpful. I also read a book on Gaslighting that truly helped me. The author said that when he wants to go, Let Him Go - if you try to talk him into staying, it will get worse and fast because he has utter contempt for you. So the moment he said he wanted out, I asked him how fast he could move out. I did not ask him to try again.",1592366732,fv38bg1,t3_ha1ga6,/r/domesticviolence/comments/ha1ga6/will_they_ever_change/fv38bg1/,1,domesticviolence,comment

923,FifiLeBean,t2_u9fjt,"There are some fantastic responses here.

When a friend did this, I eventually got up the courage to call a r\* crisis center, they were so much help because they understood.

The fact that your bf acknowledged it etc doesn't make it less of a problem, if you're wondering that. It's still traumatic, it's still awful (the friend readily admitted it, too).

I'd also highly recommend finding a local domestic violence organization. When my ex husband started to really get bad with verbal abuse, I found the local dv organization really helpful. 

Both of these organizations have people trained in helping in ways that are truly helpful and healing. They know how to help in ways that family and friends and general strangers do not. 

I hope you get the help you need. You are worthy of help, kindness, gentleness, respect. I am so sorry for this trauma to you.

924,C8H10N4O2xlife,t2_ern2w,"Agreed. 

That feeling you feel now? Lost and helpless? At a loss, searching for an explanation?

That is why. The way you feel is why he did it and why he admitted it so easily the next morning. He will go on to downplay what happened and make you doubt yourself. He might even apologize and say you’re overreacting. This is classic abusive behavior.  

No matter what else you decide to do about this, I suggest you write down as much as you can, every excruciating detail you remember. It won’t be pleasant but future you may need it some day. Not even necessarily for legal reasons, but because when dramatic things happen we often subconsciously look for ways to forget the worst parts. It sounds like this might already be happening for you (believing it was a dream suggests you thought you’d imagined it). But you need to remember. 

Don’t let him downplay it. Don’t let yourself downplay it. It is not an overreaction to start thinking about a safety plan.",1592244711,fuxc71m,t1_fuv5f1o,/r/domesticviolence/comments/h94a1g/my_boyfriend_raped_me_i_want_to_understand_why/fuxc71m/,2,domesticviolence,comment

It took me about a year to leave. It took me so long because he always told me he didn’t remember. Then it was because of his apparent mental health issues (btw mental health may exacerbate abuse but it does not cause it). Then when I realized that he knew what he was doing and had complete control of his actions I started planning my exit. We were separated but I was still financially reliant on him, had no friends or family around (moved from a different country) and lived in the middle of nowhere with no vehicle. He shut down our joint bank account and would give me tiny amounts of cash now and then but never enough so that I could leave. I had to go to food banks to eat and he ripped up my passport. 

At first he was my best friend, the best man I had ever met. It started with him throwing things and it ended with him leaving me for dead. Luckily I survived.... it never ends with a slap but it could end with death.

Rape isnt about love, or confusion if you want it or not, its about power, rage and control. You are not loved and respected by this person. You were betrayed and violated and hurt. And I know this is all terrifying, hurtful, and very confusing. Please reach out for support from RAINN.org. You have choices here on whether or not you report it to the police, however, please get to the ER to get screened and make sure no damage has been done. And it will be documented if you want to report it later. You may change your mind when you have had some time to see this person you think right now cares for you doesnt. Its hard to break that cognitive dissonance of in your mind, him being someone that cares and loves you and also at the same time your rapist. The two thoughts are in direct contrast from each other and both cannot really be true at the same time. So give yourself options for later if you want them, and protect yourself now with getting treatment. And reach out for support from RAINN.org to find a therapist that can help you with this crisis. Its not fair, you certainly didnt expect or deserve to have this happen to you, but you now have to deal with it. And you deserve to have full support and resources to work through this.

She will be on the defensive, and she will be on the defensive for his team.  Likewise if you say ""I think he's an asshole.""

Don't tell her anything except that you are concerned for her safety. Ask questions. Start with something general like, ""How bad does it get?"" and then some more specific questions. Questions like, ""Has he ever hit you?"" and, ""Has he ever choked you?"" and, ""Does he ever threaten to hurt himself, you, or the baby?"" If she doesn't want to talk about it, say something like, ""I know it's hard to talk about, but I am your friend and I care about you. This conversation is private, it's just you and me here. I just want you to be safe."" Sometimes, answering these questions out loud is all the push someone needs to realize how bad their situation has gotten. Having someone to listen and care without judging is always helpful.

Listen to her, and wait until the right moment to suggest any kind of intervention like leaving him or coming to stay at your place. And by the right moment I mean after weeks or months of having these heart-to-hearts, and keeping notes on any escalations you see. By the right moment, I mean when it escalates to him hitting her, hurting himself, or hurting the baby, or when his threats sound credible.   


If he remains at his current level of emotionally abusive and physically threatening (breaking things), keep notes on that as well. Keep checking in to listen to your friend. Repeat things she says back to her - sometimes hearing someone else say it makes it more sharply real.  


Don't say ""I don't want your baby growing up in these circumstances"" because she will 100% take that to mean that she really IS a bad mother just like he says she is.

1975,GrapeSodaJamz,t2_11mzme,"I am so sorry to read about your friend’s situation. I was in an abusive relationship for about three years and I know it was really hard on people close to me who just didn’t understand why I was repeatedly going back to him after incidences of violence and public verbal abuse. I consider myself to be a smart, rational person and it was insanely hard to leave (And no kids). I felt a lot of shame, guilt, and despair, but was so determined to “help” my partner and “win him over with love” or whatever else I told myself to rationalize perpetually being uncomfortable and scared in my own home. I think the best thing my friends and family did for me during this time was to be so damn supportive, loving, and nonjudgmental (though I know they vented a lot to each other and were very worried). They never made me feel like I was wrong or bad or “messing up” and just were genuinely patient, kind, and available to me when I needed to stay over for a week or two or cry on the phone and they weren’t over-the-top “holy shit, you NEED to get out of this!” even if that’s how they felt. They made me feel like I was still an autonomous human who was still smart and capable of good decisions despite my irrational behavior and still made me feel like a valuable person and like I was the same person I had always been and that they had always been friends with. I guess this is all to say that I’m sure your friend is very concerned too, but shame from abuse is so isolating and something that you feel is your fault, your responsibility, and deserved. It was nice to be around friends and family who just gave gentle reminders that it was not what I deserved and that I wasn’t this person deserving of so much hate as I had believed, and it was really nice that no one ever added to my shame and guilt. I would just make it clear to your friend that you love her and are concerned for her safety, but trust her judgement, and are here to offer support, and maybe approach the conversation in a way that lays it out more as “I’m observing this and it’s really worrying because I love you so much and know this is not a situation I want someone I love to be in because it can be incredibly dangerous, but also, I understand that relationships are complicated and I don’t know exactly what is happening in yours,” than any sort of “You’re smarter than this. Get out!!!” approach.

Literally anywhere. The most obvious solution based on your post is to stay with one of your friends until you can get on your feet.

No. This is a fact that families of mentally ill people cope with. They cannot force the ill person to get treatment. The only thing they can do is refuse to collaborate. They do that by going no contact. Anything else amounts to condoning the current state of affairs.

2388,captivecows,t2_3tvalkrn,"I am so sorry for what you went through. I too was in an abusive relationship, so I can relate and empathize. I just want to give you some facts on high-risk HPV, because I also have it. It is hard not to freak out when you hear HPV.  BUT did you know that 80 percent of people in the world have come in contact with HPV at some point in their lives? That is 1 in 4 people. High-risk HPV sounds scary, but luckily it (in vast majority of cases) clears on its own in 1-2 years. If it does not clear, things can be done to get rid of the abnormal cells on your cervix. The number of people who actually develop cancer from this is only a minority of people.  The diagnosis is still very distressing, and it took me a while to come to terms with it, but it is important to remember that you are SO not alone. So many people have it and most gynos dont even test girls for it until age 21 because they assume that most have it, a lot of people do and don’t even know it because it has no symptoms so they think nothings wrong. The word high risk can be very scary, but as long as you keep up with your appointments and stay healthy, you have a better chance of clearing this naturally. I am so sorry you are going through this and it isnt fair. Especially after all the abuse and trauma you went through. I just wanted to state these facts because I too was in your shoes (almost the exact same situation because my abuser gave it to me), but once I educated myself a little more on the virus, I realize it is very annoying but it is not the end of the world. You got this and I hope you heal mentally from the abuse as well as clear the virus &lt;3  Feel free to PM me if you have any questions.

2391,ImYesILeffHisAss2398,t2_2egrzrvq,"No I dont think courts will notify others unless they are a witness or a party to the case. And his criminal charges believe it or not may or may not effect a custody hearing. It sure will look bad for him and will come up, but being abusive to you doesnt equal being abusive to a child. He has a full time child that will be paraded to show what a good parent he is too. You also dont want to assume that the Mothers of these kids will want to have anything to do with your divorce or custody issues. They may not want to do anything at all because it would cause issues with him attacking them and harassing them or because like the one parent doesnt have anything to do with the child. 

Abusers need to be in control and will create battles to ""win"" even if it hurts them. So be sure you pick and choose your battles carefully and dont just react emotionally to anything he does or says. Take your time to process everything evenly. Dont even respond to any contact that doesnt go through your lawyer.

I was in a similar position but I was still with my abuser. I found out I had high risk HPV. I’m 28 now but when I found out I was 24. I cried for days, week. I was freaking out. I had to go to the gyno so they could send off some of my cervix to get tested for cancer. Nothing could console me. What I found out is that legitimately everyone has HPV. There are no symptoms, there’s no way to know unless you’ve been tested. I grew up in a very religious household so my dad never got me the vaccines because I had taken a purity vow (oops) and he didn’t think there was a need to because I was saving myself for marriage. Fyi that ship sailed long ago. I was 24 and got the catch up vaccine after I was diagnosed. Go to the gyno regularly, keep up with it, and practice some good self-care. I promise that it’s going to be okay, I’ve been in remission for about 2.5 years now and get tested regularly. There’s no been trace of it since I’ve been in remission.

There is no DA, although the family advocacy program can take weeks, they also aren't a court or the cops, they have no power they just vote and make a ""determination"" that carries no weight.  They are a bunch of lazy civilian govt employee types who often sell victims out to cut deals with commands and lie about what is or isn't domestic violence anyway.

They can put an MPO in place NOW.  The commanding officer is judge and jury, if they feel he is a threat that's it, and documented violence means if they don't place one you need to just keep going up the food chain.  If they like having a career they'll hammer him just to be safe.

Once you have that, take it to the civilian courts and ask for a DVPO, restraining order ect.

No, domestic violence doesn't directly impact custody (but it really says he's a turd...).  HOWEVER, his parental rights as a criminal DO NOT start until after you are safe and free, so if that restraining order causes him hardship, that's his problem as a father.

YOU NEED TO READ DoD instruction 6400.01.  that's the regs on family advocacy and domestic violence.  They are also required to adhere to state and local laws regarding it.

You need copies of the report with military police (FOIA request time), and then you need to find out if he was arrested/investigated.  They like to take reports and do nothing, and they get away with it until someone notices.

Your Mom could also reach out to local abuse agencies for resources and an exit plan. 

I would also recommend you check out thehotline.org for the page for friends and family of victims, as well as the information on what is abuse, what it looks like including the power wheel. Abuse is very much like addiction, the abuser the drug, with conditioning and brainwashing tactics. It takes on average of 7 attempts to leave an abusive relationship (so as an average there are people that never leave, some take more then 7 attempts, and of course less attempts to achieve safety). Abuse suppresses logic and grabs you by your emotions in a push/pull. Its incredibly hard to get free, and once you are free, to stay free.

It's why I'm hopeful there's maybe a loophole of some sort we can notify police of so that perhaps they could take him back to jail or something.

My brother is 100% old enough, but no one has faith in him anymore to actually do anything with his life. To us, it feels like either a choice between letting him run rampant at my dad's or literally letting him die because he's so incapable and hostile that we know he won't find a place of his own, there's not really an ""if"" in the question. Both are obviously pretty heavy choices and we just hope there's a third option. 

Honestly, we all believe (even my dad) him spending the rest of his life in jail would be the best option for everyone, including him.

2824,icgntordt360,t2_6pzvtti1,"Was afraid of that. My dad will never kick him out. He simply doesn't have the strength or balance at his age to remotely defend himself. My other brother is a rather big guy who could handle him with no issue, but he can't stake himself out at the house every day or he'd lose his job. I live an hour and half away myself and to be honest, while I have won some scraps against him myself, he's a lot bigger than me. I'm 6'1"" 165 lbs, but he's 6'0"" at about 250 lbs. I'd need some backup for sure.

My brother knows my older brother can handle him though, because every time they're together he suddenly behaves relatively nicely. 

APS sounds like the best lead so far, but the concern is preventing harm, not reacting to it. I fear that if my brother does respond with violence, he won't just stop at harm and he'd kill him. I can't overstate enough that my brother is 99% of the time not in his right mind these days. You hear him make comments that proves he has some memories sometimes, but for the most part he fabricates information and even gets aggressive over these events that never happened.

Just the other day he called my other brothers phone to rant that my dad was ""talking shit about him"". I just don't know when he'll come up with some crazy idea in his head that he feels his best solution is to assault my dad over it. I'll definitely see what info APS can offer, though.

I’m sure this isn’t the first time you and your kids have had to suffer due to his temper issues. I grew up with a very abusive father and a weak mother, like you. She was his punching bag and most of my childhood memories are of him hitting her and subsequently hitting me too. Your kids may look like they’ve moved on from it but the effects of such trauma only become prevalent in older years. I watched my dad be abusive for 18 years before I moved out. After that I chose to ignore it although sometimes I’d call and know from my mother’s voice that something has happened. However all throughout my childhood and until he passed away, she chose to stick by him ‘for me’ because she didn’t want me to grow up without a father. But boy was that the worst decision she could ever make in her entire life. As a result of her decision, I am now a 25 year old with anxiety and depression. I am still scared of him although he isn’t alive. I can’t let go of the hatred even though he is dead. My trauma is so deep that even counselling and therapy has to be specialist.

Sounds like he has mental health issues hitting as hard as addiction or criminal.. those seem the output over input.

Elderly services and police you're right won't intervene with the legal consequences until after any hypothetical crime.  The brother you have emotional and physical fears of ""what he CAN do"" to you, your dad, and him isn't your responsibility.  I get you want to focus on what you control to prevent potential danger, but disengaging and untangling your life and responsibility is the best path.  Seems you think a lot of big bro, and dad gets that endless, you are terrified of him and helpless but every one of you keeps misplacing your responsibility in this in different ways that counterintuitively are unproductive.  You see the ways your dad is, do you see yours?

Now, I'll tell you that the best bet and absolute only chance you have of preventing his future crimes and escalating any antagonistic chess play to take his freedom--- not police or elderly protective services...  Dudes crimes and addiction either come from or at least display as mental illness.  I bet if you're in a place with laws in place you could and may most benefit from Baker Acting him.  That involves police, they control or escalate to higher violence, and professionals likely would diagnose his underlying mental health issues.

I'm just afraid that each person will have to stand up to him I  the way he has power over them and choose to walk away from or hold boundaries with him equal.  Because even in a mental hospital (which sounds most hopeful and accurate) won't solve things or be long term.  This seems about dominance, insecurity, fear, and each person's place he has hurt or found leverage personally.  Seems all that he uses to hide the underlying issues, buy I know your fears are NOT unfounded, he is dangerous and desperate, and sick and hurt and in a corner...  I worry because if you take a half and temporary action that may finally be the needed impetus for him to fully and finally be everything he is feared to be and seen as.

I'm scared for y'all, seems you are doing what you can with the police but if he's Baker acted and you keep pressing the available addiction, police, parole, and now most immediately for Baker act or mental health (danger to self or others)...  I believe that following the steps and police not helping earlier, hopefully they would and will continue to take it more serious and if able to institutionalize- finally protect ahead of time.",1591832083,ftn145s,t1_ftlmg16,/r/domesticviolence/comments/h07a96/brother_38_is_a_massive_threat_towards_my_dad_74/ftn145s/,1,domesticviolence,comment

2838,RocketFuelMaItLiquor,t2_1pzk848i,"It's a lot easier for your brother to get help once hes already in the system but that would require your father saying no to allowing him to come back home after his next arrest, mental health hospitalization or inpatient rehabilitation stay.  I've had to do it myself and turn away my mom even though she did end up homeless for quite sometime after she destroyed her own apartment, got evicted and got her car towed.   I had no choice because I would have been evicted myself for having her stay.

I've had the police get angry and demand that I pick her up across the state but then I'd be responsible for housing her and shed just leave whatever hospital I'd drop her off at anyways.  Eventually she got sectioned for six months but they found her housing through a program which shes still involved with now. 

I put a lot of effort into bailing out and fixing her car but shes recently off her meds after 2.5 years of compliance and her car is gone again and its really too beat up to be worth the impound fees so my efforts were still only short lived. 

Unfortunately, there's really nothing your dad can do to help him besides doing what hes doing and thats not working out for him.   Its hard to decide to let go but there are social programs better suited to help people like your brother.  It hurts but how much longer can he afford to do this for?  Can he even afford to retire with all of this spending?   

At least if your brother is in the system, social workers can help your brother apply for disability for the schizo-affective disorders at the very least and help him with some sort of supervised housing.

In the meantime, you should encourage your father to report his credit card stolen and maybe stick around for the fallout if you'd like to be the one to call the police when he has an outburst about your father calling about the credit card and phone purchase fraud.

Again, no idea how much money your father has, but the average person couldn't afford these expenses indefinitely, especially after retirement and your father will have a very hard time with relationships with your brother around.  So the options for your father are: die broke and alone first, followed by your brother when theres no one to support him.

   Or he can drop the rope and help out social support program workers with a care plan so they know his baseline, history,  and personal info so he can move forward with some sort of plan to live a meaningful life.

2852,secondhandbanshee,t2_3woxk3sk,"If you are in the U.S., most places do not consider verbal, psychological, and emotional abuse to be abuse from a legal standpoint. It's messed up and not at all reflective of the serious damage such abuse does, but it's the way it is. If one of the victims is a minor, you might report the abuse to CPS, but it is very unlikely they can/will do anything. It is very hard to prove unless there's a recording and you live in a state with one-party consent laws. Even then, it's unlikely to do much good. (But it's worth reporting anyway, if only to start establishing a record.)

What you can do is to get in touch with your local domestic violence organization or call the national hotline. In the US, 1-800-799-7233 or there's an online [chat](https://www.thehotline.org/). They can help you evaluate your options and make a plan for your own safety. 

If the other person being abused is an adult, there's nothing you can do to force them to escape or accept help. If they choose to stay, you may have to prioritize your own safety and hope they gain enough courage from your example. If you are a minor, this still holds true. Talk to a domestic violence advocate about ways you can get help without the support of the victimized parent. 

There's a book you might find helpful (and that might help the other abused person in your home as well, if they'll read it). It's called [Why Does He Do That? Inside the Minds of Angry and Controlling Men](https://smile.amazon.com/Why-Does-He-That-Controlling/dp/0425191656) by Lundy Bancroft. Even if your abuser isn't male, it's very informative and, at least for me, helped me make some hard decisions. You can probably find it as an ebook from the local library if you are worried about having a physical copy around. 

Finally, yes, you should trust your instincts. The only difference between physical abuse and psychological/emotional abuse is the weapon the abuser uses. The damage is just as real. The kind of abuse you are enduring also tends to escalate to physical abuse. 

Please do what you need to do to protect yourself. You deserve to be safe. I'll be thinking about you and I'm sending virtual hugs if you want them. Stay strong.

3303,SpiritedLink,t2_2gytdf7u,"You are NOT overreacting. His behavior is abusive shows significant red flags for escalation - 1) threats for physical violence 2) attempts to frame you as the abuser by recording you afterward, and saying you were blocking him and looked crazy while doing so (spittle reference) 3) financial control - these are acts of domestic violence. Abusers often manipulate those they abuse by making them think it's not a big deal - that coupled with the tendency we all have to minimize trauma as a survival instinct means everything you are feeling and all of your doubts/questioning are totally normal. Trust your gut, not your head in this one. If you feel unsafe then you are unsafe.

Consider checking out the domestic violence power and control wheel - see if you identify with any of the tactics in that wheel.  If you have access to a national or local domestic violence hotline, the advocates who answer those phones can be SO helpful in validating your experience, helping you process what's really going on, talk through your options, and even help you take action if you decide you're ready for that. Hang in there. You are important. You are not alone in your experience. And you deserve to feel safe, secure and loved. &lt;3",1591741311,ftivrtv,t3_gzo06j,/r/domesticviolence/comments/gzo06j/not_sure_what_to_do/ftivrtv/,1,domesticviolence,comment

My advice is just be there for her as much as you can, without any judgement. Stay in contact. Let her know you love her and will always be there for her.
Tell her as much as you can. 

You could also casually tell her at the end of any conversation, that if she ever has any problems, even with her relationship, that she can always come to you. Let her know somehow that you know something is up and then leave it at that.

If things get worse, then I would just speak to her directly one on one. Show her a list of ""common signs of abusive relationship"" or something similar (when he is not around of course) and tell her to call you if she ever needs further information.

What really helped me was a domestic abuse hotline. I didn't even realize what was really going on until I spoke to some stranger, that told me his behavior is not ok. I needed that reassurance. Kinda pulled me out of that fog I was in. Maybe you can let her call a hotline like that.

No one can tell you what to do...

But here are some hard facts about abusers.

1. It always gets worse. It doesn't go away. You will always spend your time trying to keep the abuser happy by walking on eggshells. Which kinda makes things worse because they will eventually find something that is the problem. Why? Because it isn't about what you do or don't don't do. It is because they are abusive.

2. Abusers rarely change. The odds are shockingly small. I think maybe the 1 percent of abusers who go to an actual batterers intervention will change. 

Since you're on the fence, I highly suggest you be prepared. Find out what happens if you break your lease early. Have a domestic violence number ready. List of local shelters. Keep finances separate. Always have a way to leave quickly. (Important documents and keys hidden) Have a safety &amp; escape plan ready for when she does hit you again. I don't say this to scare you, but it escalates. Especially the suicide threats. That's abuse.

Research (Lundy Bancrofts ""why does he do that applies to all abusers"") it's a PDF online and it's free.

it’s imperative that you do this because if you don’t, who’s to say he does it? there’s no proof. judges do not go on here say, they go on facts. make it your absolute priority to record every interaction that is had with your children and you. also have a journal. date and time record on paper all interactions, this alone wouldn’t be amazing but to prove that you have been recording everything both digitally and on paper will make the judge very pleased and i can 100% assure you that he isn’t preparing because he thinks he can do no wrong. so don’t leave anything unrecorded.",1591674263,ftfwytt,t3_gz5u3u,/r/domesticviolence/comments/gz5u3u/abusive_coparent/ftfwytt/,4,domesticviolence,comment

3816,ImYesILeffHisAss2398,t2_2egrzrvq,"I recommend you check out thehotline.org page for friends and family of victims. Its very painful to watch and know your loved one is with an abusive partner, even more so knowing there is a child there that could be hurt. It can be easy to fall into victim blaming, arguing with them, trying to force them to leave, making deals with them to leave, etc. And if you try to push they may isolate from you because they are not ready to leave. 

It takes an average of 7 attempts to leave an abusive relationship. Thats an average, so many more longer and shorter. They dont go back or stay because they are okay with the abuse. Abuse is more like addiction, the abuser the drug, with brainwashing and conditioning to it. Logic tends to get suppressed and emotions are used to manipulate and threaten. And if police are involved already, there may be a chance that CPS may be involved going forward. 

So I would take the time to read up and learn what abuse looks like, how it works, what it does, and why it works on the victim. Read about how to be supportive yet not forceful or pushing on the victim. And know if you cannot emotionally handle it taking a step back may be necessary at times when you need to let go of that anxiety and pain. There is a fear that holds you when its someone you love, especially a child involved.",1591677758,ftg1z2c,t3_gzf3xp,/r/domesticviolence/comments/gzf3xp/younger_sister_in_abusive_relationship/ftg1z2c/,1,domesticviolence,comment

Make sure you are using safe electronics to reach out to these folks because spyware and keyloggers can be on many electronics and are very very easy to install and use.

3820,pavlovs_conditioner,t2_4d6tpevu,"I second this. Don't take on the burden of healing in isolation. There are people out there who want to support you so that you don't do this alone. Isolation perpetuates intimate partner abuse. The bigger your support system, the less likely the abuse continues. You don't have to do this alone and the more support you have, the better.

Also, have a plan b. I can't tell you how many clients I've met that escaped abuse and moved in with a friend or a family member, only to find themselves homeless once more because of some petty issue. Sometimes, the abuser discovers where the survivor has moved to and the survivor is no longer safe in their new place. Having a plan b means planning for the possibility of going to a domestic violence shelter. It could also mean seeking assistance from your local county government for short term, low income housing. In LA, the county will pay up to 2 weeks for a victim to stay in a motel.

And do yourself a HUGE favor - get into counseling. While you may have escaped your partner's abuse, it's important for you to explore how you can break the cycle of abuse in your life once and for all. Many DV programs offer free counseling services. If you are in Los Angeles, call 211 and ask for free DV counseling. They'll have plenty of referrals. If you're outside of LA, call the National DV Hotline and they'll find a local referral for you. With COVID 19, many providers have switched to online counseling so that may make things easier for you.

Lastly, the less people around you know about your plan to leave, the better. But wait, didn't I say you should increase your support system? Seek professional assistance. But as you plan to leave, identity one or two key people that you trust to keep the secret. And never tell your abuser you are leaving. Worst mistake ever. I may be preaching to the choir here, but I can't tell you how many of my clients tell their abuser that they're leaving and then they get sweet talked into staying only for the abuse to escalate in a few weeks.

For reference, I am an LCSW and a therapist.  This message does not constitute therapy. I'm sharing my expertise in the hope that one more survivor makes it to the other side of freedom.",1591679290,ftg3zni,t1_ftg28v5,/r/domesticviolence/comments/gzfhmp/advice_for_my_escape_plan/ftg3zni/,4,domesticviolence,comment

What im saying is you're not just dealing with the heartbreak from a future that will never be, you're conquering an addiction too. And that's tough. 

You're way stronger than you think you are and it only gets better with time! Take the opportunity to get to know yourself again. I bet you've spent so much time walking on eggshells you haven't had a chance to get properly acquainted in recent years.

What you need to be mindful of is that you did something in response to what he escalated first.  Examples...

Bad ""I threw a lotion bottle at him""

Good ""he punched the wall and came towards me, I threw a lotion bottle at him to keep him away from me""

Both if those are factually true descriptions of the same events.  Abusers tend to be very narsacistic people.  They'll complain about hurting their hand punching your face in.  Human nature is to empathize and mirror so when he focuses on what you did and ignores his own crimes (because he's a shitty fucked up person...) You'll do the same and focus on your own actions ignoring his.  Spitting doesn't justify violence.  Assuming you've had sex, probably exchanged more intimate fluids than spit.

What the police prefer is that both of you became spontaneously violent at the same time and they can call it fair, no matter how much bigger or stronger he was.  Don't give them that.

You will get out as its only a matter of time until you cant cover up for him and he gets arrested, he kills you or you finally leave as you are statistically more likely one of these options vs staying together for the rest of your lives. So save you and your son now and make an escape plan.

4343,evaspaghetti123,t2_4npdoi1z,"Hey, I’m so sorry this is happening to you. I’m so so sorry about your baby. Im sure this doesn’t make it feel any better but it may be a comfort to hear that I truly believe that God has a special place in his heart for babies who didn’t make it into the world ❤️ I also want to say that the abortion was not your fault. I know you did it but you were scared of your boyfriend and you were not in the right state of mind at the time. People in abusive situations are in survival mode, not normal life mode. It is normal to act abnormally in abnormal circumstances. I wish the woman who was with you had asked if you wanted to do it :-( I know PTSD is often contracted in women even after getting an abortion when they are fully consensual to it. You might want to look into that and seek help for it. 

Finally, please leave your boyfriend. You don’t have to contact the cops unless you feel your life is at risk. The first priority is leaving and finding a safe place to go. There are shelters and safe havens for battered women. Don’t be afraid to go to one, they will believe you I promise. Just get away from him and don’t look back. If he comes after you once you leave, get a restraining order. Abusers are not to be fucked around with, don’t take your time. Be your own friend and save yourself, this guy sounds dangerous and just like an all around awful human to be around. Abuse is often escalated over time not reduced so please leave soon. you are so strong and I believe in you I know it’s hard but it’s so worth it and one day you’ll look back and be so proud of yourself for getting away from this asshole!!",1591577686,ftbmwrm,t3_gykc5n,/r/domesticviolence/comments/gykc5n/im_confused_alone_and_afraid/ftbmwrm/,1,domesticviolence,comment

4798,FifiLeBean,t2_u9fjt,"I am sure he's said plenty of things to blame you. It's a little known tactic of abusers that they constantly are trying to keep you off balance and unable to detect exactly what they are doing. They keep the focus of attention on you so that it's harder for you to see them. They strategically do a lot of little things that are hard to figure out so that you are just so exhausted and wondering why you feel upset. 

My sister used to say vicious things with a sweet smile on her face and lots of nice words mixed in so I couldn't figure out what she was saying and others would think she was nice. I finally unraveled why I felt so enraged around her. 
Right now, my ex is hanging out with his brand new best friend: the neighbor across the street from me. My ex currently lives 25 miles away. The other neighbors are trying to find a way to justify this behavior (of both the ex and the @ssh0le neighbor and his gf who knew that my ex was abusive) and they can't. I'm looking into whether I can get a restraining order. But they are doing the exact same thing: trying to keep me off balance, trying to distract me with seemingly innocent behavior.

You should call someone immediately and get out of that house as quickly as you can.

Either way: yes, get out of that house ASAP, and next time ANYTHING like that happens ever again, you call the police IMMEDIATELY.

Depending on what he says, offer him and his mother resources in your area that can help them. If he doesn’t wanna call the police, atleast give him a phone number for the DV hotline.

He made a gesture, he's been violent before, he doesn't live or work there, doesn't matter whatever just call the cops.  Get his plate, make and model so you can say yeah, that was him, and get the report number and get copies ASAP.  That's stalking in any state.  Getting a dvpo with 4 fresh stalking or harassment reports is world's different than asking based on something a month old.  My wife got told she needed ""2 black eyes"" and she needed to file before it healed.

Build around CRIMES.

Big mistake is to show everyone what an asshole he is and when he hurt you feelings.  Courts don't care about that and they won't read through a mountain of asshole or crazy to find the crimes for you.

Read the relevant laws on stalking, harassment (if it's not the same law), and on Domestic violence (you should qualify for those protections since you share a child).  You'll be surprised, it's probably only about a page long each, but they cover ALOT.  You'll also realize almost no cop has read them, and most lawyers havent.  Make highlights and keep them handy, I've read them out loud to dozens of cops, more than a few lawyers, and a magistrate who all started out saying bullshit.

Find the worst CRIME he committed, and gather the evidence around  that one event.  For example, he threatened you, then harassed you about it, tried to intimidate you about reporting, then lied to the cops and laughed at you via text about that, which are all violations related to the initial crime.  Move to the second worst specific incidence, then do the same and so one.  Do one a day, it's tiring and upsetting.  I gather evidence 24/7, but putting am event together I do quietly because you're reliving to remember and organize it.

You'll need to have dates and times of his messages or interactions.  Hopefully it's all texts, recordings and video.  Police reports are great too obviously, you'll get used to FOIA requests, which take time so 14 days is pretty short notice.  Get what you can, and even after the protective order, get more until you have it all, you'll regret it later because records start getting dumped fast.

You also need to have running full texts conversations, bring it on a CD and print if possible, maybe flag the parts you reference.  Along with that phone records to verify that he sent texts or made the calls.  Without that then in court it's your words vs his and he isn't asking anything, so the burden of proof is on you.",1591501067,ft8h2a4,t3_gy09nx,/r/domesticviolence/comments/gy09nx/tips_for_organizing_3_years_of_documented_abuse/ft8h2a4/,1,domesticviolence,comment

4826,Lamzn6,t2_4n3bt,"I don’t know how old you are, but I feel I must tell you that it’s unlikely this only happened once before. 

You were almost definitely fed a bunch of BS. I’m so sorry you’ve had to experience this but this is the time to learn something about narcissistic men. Your friend’s Dad is not a reasonable and intelligent person that made a mistake yesterday. He’s a domestic abuser. Virtually all domestic abusers are highly narcissistic. They are professionals at hiding who they are and presenting a good front for others to see. Alcohol abuse and narcissism are best friends. 

While I think your intention is highly admirable, I think it’s best to focus on being a good friend to your friend. Make sure he knows that his Dad’s behavior isn’t normal. It’s extremely not okay. It will almost definitely continue to happen. Statistically most abusers never change, they just move on to the next woman to beat. 

I would even suggest you see a therapist over what you witnessed because I can promise you that you will remember this the rest of your life. Invite your friend along for a session too if you can. 

I hope you hang around this sub to learn about what happens to women when we chose to stay with men who say, “it will never happen again.”

Next time you’re around something like this, feel free to video it and call the police. 

It would have happened regardless because your friends dad DID this. He made the decision for it to happen. This is way beyond the maturity level you’re expected at your seemingly young age, but please let the mom know there are many resources available. You can even tell her about this sub if you can. She absolutely needs to get away from this person who has zero respect for her. 

Please know that what you have witnessed shouldn’t be normalized. I hope you grow into a man that commands respect and is highly respectful of others. Love is action. There is no other form of love that has meaning. Only actionable love matters on earth. When you care about someone, you treat them right. End of story. 

Hugs sweetheart. Your friend and his mom deserve so much more than this.",1591515034,ft8yn1n,t3_gy3tuq,/r/domesticviolence/comments/gy3tuq/my_friends_father_just_beat_his_wife_while_i_was/ft8yn1n/,1,domesticviolence,comment

4830,Alex3335675,t2_56ryog0w,"Work with the victims help center that partners with you county’s DA.  They know what the DA likes to see and may give you explicit instructions for what to include.  Generally anything overtly threatening or harassing is what the DA wants.  “I’ll kill you if...” “Don’t make me come there and...” “I watched you from my car and...” “I’ll kill myself if you don’t talk to me...” “I saw you at ______ today...” “I‘ve been practicing my shooting...” “I’ll end you” etc etc. Also hospital or doctor records from how he hurt you, any pictures/repair bills of your property he damaged.  

You don’t need to give them every little thing he’s ever sent you.  Just things like the ones mentioned above.  And they don’t need things that date back years and years.  Start with the most recent.  They need to see that he is a threat to you *now*.  Include some things that are really bad if they go back a few years, but otherwise don’t bother.  

The only thing you need to prove is that he’s dangerous to you now.  You don’t need to prove your entire relationship with him.  

If he sent you 100 texts during a conversation and “only” 2 or 3 include threats or violent language(i.e “you b****! I’ll ruin your life!”) include only those in a printout of the screenshot.  You don’t include the whole conversation of everything you said back to him etc.  It’s irrelevant.  What you say to him is irrelevant.  This is about proving he is a danger to *you* not proving it was a “bad relationship” or you were “bad for eachother” or he cheated or anything like that.  Pretend he’s a stranger or the street.  If anything he’s said or done to you would make you feel unsafe, include that’s stuff only.  

If your attorney has done this before, they should really have a better idea than they seem to with what to give the DA. Attorneys who don’t regularly help victims of DV get RO’s often don’t know what to do in these cases even if they claim to.  Mine didn’t.  Mine gave me bad advice.  It’s not their area. But you likely don’t need an attorney for this anyway.  But you do need some help.  The victim center is free. 

Sometimes all one needs for a RO is help from the victims center referred to by the court. You can call the court help desk and ask for their number.

If you can't talk about how you feel in a relationship, if you can't express your pain without feeling threatened or at the very least like a burden. There are some major issues. Add that with emotional, mental and physical abuse your life, no matter how much you love him, will be hell.  Men that choke women in a DV relationship eventually kill them. That might seem far fetched but it really is the reality of it. Choking is a very massive red flag for get the hell out now before it's too late. 10 to 15 seconds until you can't breathe is abhorrent. No man that love you would dare do such a thing. No man that loves you would make you feel worthless and like a burden. No man that loves you ignores you and tells you the relationship is shit. 

Yes you love him but he does not love you. What he loves is his control over you. He loves because you give into him and that he can manipulate you because you love him.  He won't change and marrying him will amplify the abuse. It will get worse when you get pregnant. I lost a child while pregnant to an abusive narcissist because I wore lipstick that day which meant I wanted to attract someone /s.

Do you not work? If I can give any advice it would be - figure out a job, see if you can get anything that offers child sitting as a benefit. Make yourself completely independent. Try to be nonchalant to him in the meantime. Start distancing yourself and seeing how bad he is. Think about how many children that witness abuse go on to be abusive. 

Move out and never look back! Whether it’s your own place, or family. I really recommend telling them what’s going on.

It could make all the difference if you had a stable income, because you could go and move anywhere without financial restraints. Also, it could be something in customer service, an entry level job, or where you used to work? It could be part time as well, like hospitality? It would give you a chance to be away from him for a long period &amp; not be financially in his grip anymore. 

Do you think he is dangerous? Is it possible to talk to him and tell him he’s been abusive? Absolutely only consider this if you don’t think he would hurt you for saying this. As he’s physically hurt you often &amp; badly I’d steer clear of this option as it doesn’t seem fixable or anything you should try to fix, but I’m still laying it out as an option. 

I’m sorry you’re going through this, I know what it feels like to logically know things are wrong but emotionally want to stay. It’s so confusing. In no way should you ever be treated like this, remember how bad it is no matter what type of love he gives you after.

5297,SocietyLurker,t2_5q5rmnbu,"Update:  
I spoke to my landlord and he was concerned. But he can't do anything like kick Alex out unless he has proof.

The plan is to stay out of Alex's way and if Alex escalates to call my landlord (or the police) and that will mean he can be more involved. Because my landlord is a priest, he's also going to reach out to Alex without letting them know that I've spoken to them, because he's meant to check up on us periodically.

Two of my friends contacted me to have a bit of an intervention. Alex and Taylor have both been pretty questionable before now. Taylor's ex-roommate sexually assaulted me a few times when they lived together back in 2013-14 and Taylor and Alex have been trying to get me to be 'less frigid' and 'not as sexually repressed'. They think it's weird I don't masturbate for long periods of time, don't watch porn, and that I don't have casual sex.

Alex also hit me with their huge dildo that has a suction cup which sticks to the wall - I think Alex finds it funny because it makes me uncomfortable. Alex has also gotten mad and made a fire in a mug when they were sad, thrown their phone at me, hit me, kicked me, worked out how to unlock my bedroom and the bathroom locks from the outside and entered without permission when I've been bathing or changing. Basically it's worse than I thought when I put the things together since Alex moved in in January.

I'm going to try to move out next Friday, because I need time to pack and that's the soonest anyone can come and help. I've not told anyone except for my two friends and the person who doesn't know Alex who said I could use their drive to go to with my bag if I need to get out of the house. It's not ideal, but I'm happy to get out of here.

5298,FifiLeBean,t2_u9fjt,"I highly recommend that you reach out to a local domestic violence organization FIRST. They will help you. They are trained in this, they know exactly what he is doing and why, and they can do things like go with you to the police station to make the report, advocate for you, help you with court appearances if that is in the future, etc. Don't do this alone. 

I think the smartest thing I did was to call the domestic violence organization just over 1 year ago. 

You are in serious danger, it is escalating and can only escalate further. He might try to show remorse, but it will unfortunately only escalate. And I was married to a man who never hit me once, who had the best remorse act ever, and who willingly got counseling from a man who was a specialist in domestic violence abusers. It only escalated, the disrespect, condescension, and rage only increased over time. 

The gaps between each verbal attack got smaller and smaller. Last May I predicted it would happen in about 6 months, as that seemed like a smaller interval to me. It happened the next month. The next gap was 10 days. etc.

 or just look up BPD (borderline personality disorder), its actually fairly common to varying degrees, there isn't a test or scan, and those who have it rage against being labeled with it so virtually no one get diagnosed and acknowledges it, it's pretty easy to spot though.

It's basically the traits that are shared by the majority of abusive and shitty awful people.

Good luck

I'll give you some advice I got from Adam Carolla about 20 years ago.

""There are A+ kids and F- kids.  Everyone knows this, and they cut parents slack and assume they did their best.  No one gives kids a break though when an A+ kid gets born to a D- parent.  Kids turns out bad, blame the kid, turns out good, credit to the parents but it makes no sense.  If you've got F parents, then you don't owe them so F them and go live your A+ life, you earned it and you might actually be happy.""

Mom threw me out at 16, haven't talked to her since and it's been the best 20 years of my life.  Moved out at 18 and joined the military, stopped talking to my dad at 20, never missed him either.  Let's just say they weren't good people or parents.

Only regret?  Not kicking my dad's ass before he died, just because.

He felt no remorse and says I abused him sighting the scratches on his face from me trying to fight back and defend myself and get him off me, while I'm covered in welts, bruises, scratches, a busted knee, messed up hands from him holding me down and a busted ear drum.

r/abusesurvivors 

r/abusiveparents 

r/emotionalabuse 

r/raisedbynarcissists

and there are others too. The r/raisedbynarcissists and r/raisedbyborderlines are kinda weird because they are themed around people's 'self-diagnosis' or 'armchair diagnosis' of someone else's mental health problems. I don't think that's very useful. I think you can talk about a narcissistic pattern of abuse, for example, without necessarily needing to label your abuser in medical terms. 

Other than that though... I'm sorry you've met with such r/emotionalneglect when trying to reach out to other people about your mom's abusive behavior. 

I'm glad you know that you need to get healing from this, and that your mother's behavior is not healthy or normal, and that it is in fact abusive. The main thing to do is recover for yourself, and that will also require getting space away from her. Separate yourself as much as you can. Good luck, and I'm sorry you're dealing with this. But definitely know you're not alone... child abuse is really common unfortunately. The state of parenting (I'm in the US) is as broken as the police... And actually there are striking similarities and parallels between parent's abuses of children and how there's no help, and how society helps them cover it up, lets them get away with it, deny it, etc., and the civil-rights-denying violence of police. Just something to think about. Authoritarian violence always sucks.

5323,justalilbraindamage,t2_6562ua2c,"...I was agreeing with you. 

I said ""f\*ck the BPD bashing, I agree.""

But I'm glad that you're sticking up for your friend. BPD is the most discriminated against mental health label that I know of. Misinformed/false caricatures of it are always being used in 'relationship thriller' movies to portray people with BPD as dangerous and abusive. When in reality they're people in pain, and who frequently are at risk of harming themselves, not others. They're also very frequently abuse survivors, to the point that it might be more useful to talk about the condition as a trauma response. 

I've been diagnosed with BPD before, and so have multiple people I love. And out of those multiple people, the only one I know who has real anger or aggression problems is a combat veteran who has war-related PTSD, and I really feel that having been deployed in war is the factor that makes him have a pronounced 'fight ~~or flight~~' response when he feels threatened... not BPD.

I wouldn't describe anyone I know who's been diagnosed with BPD as 'abusive'... at all. I regard people who have been diagnosed with the condition as among the sweetest, most authentic, empathetic, friendly, sincere, fun, and loving people I know. If you take the label away, they're just normal people who had shitty childhoods that continue to impact them as adults. I really don't see them as 'labels' but as people--among the best that I've known. That's why I said 'F the BPD bashing.' 

I actually have a lot of love, sympathy, and familiarity with this condition. And while my diagnosis has since been changed to bipolar disorder, I do think I (34) had a lot of traits of borderline disorder when I was in my early 20s. And I'm not ashamed of that. It's not a shameful thing. It's a condition that the mental health professionals hate because they don't know how to treat it, so they decide to promote hate of the people they diagnose with it. I also suspect being diagnosed with it just means you're a young woman with problems, and your mental health professional doesn't like you. There are a ton of criticisms about how professionals use the diagnosis, and how they treat people with the diagnosis. And then there are straight up hate sites like this one  [https://sharischreiber.com/articles-and-forums/](https://sharischreiber.com/articles-and-forums/) . It's just ridiculous. 

I'm not gonna tell you to go fuck yourself, or take offense to what you said, because I see we had a misunderstanding.

Two weeks ago he also called the police as it seems that initially the police weren't going to come since what I heard didn't sound like physical violence, just very intense verbal abuse. I am moving out of this place in 4 weeks and I will ask my neighbour to please keep an ear out for any more abuse so that he can take action if needed.

The police came again this morning and called me outside to talk to me because they were having trouble entering the building. As soon as I came down a man opened the door to leave (I suspect he's the abuser) and the police started questioning him. So hopefully progress will be made. I heard the woman speaking on the phone last night and she was saying how she knew the police had come but that she didn't open the door. I don't know if she's scared of what might happen to the abuser or just scared in general but I hope I made the right call and that this will ultimately lead to her getting away from him.",1591437921,ft3gw1i,t1_ft3dm16,/r/domesticviolence/comments/gx41j6/i_can_hear_my_neighbour_being_abused/ft3gw1i/,2,domesticviolence,comment

5356,Feathered_Terror,t2_6hg9v5r5,"Cops don't do anything. And don't ever count in them to speak up and help you. They treat domestic abuse as a ""domestic situation"" meaning, it was just a fight.

But it wasn't a fight, you were assaulted. That is domestic violence.

So if the cops won't help, who do you contact? A domestic hotline who can get you in touch with an advocate.

An advocate is someone who will help you navigate. They help you make a safety plan to leave, the help you get paper work to file a police report, get in touch with programs for legal assistance, housing assistance ect.

The Advocate is your lifeline to resources and helping you understand your options.

Again, never rely on the police. Try a domestic violence hotline and then try (depending on your location) if your local pd has a victims advocate.

5799,vmt1964,t2_6o3n9ve9,"If he leaves any evidence such as bruises, etc make sure you document and get pictures. Save this stuff in a safe place. Continue to log and keep information, kind of like a diary of episodes. Journal and keep those somewhere safe. try to tuck a few bucks away here and there. eventually, unfortunately,  he will do something you can document and have proof. The law needs evidence and without it they can't do much. Is there a way to seek counseling? Counseling can get you the needed support and information to get your plan in place. If you are not afraid of him physically hurting you, can you walk away or at that point do you feel there is going to be a more immediate threat? I was in a situation that was more verbal than physical, however there were some physical situations and always the threat of harm to me or my kids. I documented everything. I took pictures when i could of bruises and i used a micro cassette recorder to record a situation if i could. There were some instances that were bad enough to require doctor care and i finally told them why i had cracked ribs, etc. that then became documented as well at that point. I made a police report, but i did not press charges. That way he did not know i did it, but it was on record. Anything you can do to build a case of evidence and not let him know, is encouraged. It may take awhile, but you will eventually get what you need to get out and to keep him away. If you can get the order for protection, make sure you report any time he violates it. You much report each violation! Stay strong and keep trying. You will at some point know when and how to do it. It will just happen and perhaps it may take something that is out of your control to get the job done. Don't pass up an opportunity and don't go back once you are out. We all do it seems, whether it is out of fear or because he seems sorry. It will not change. It will not get better. Things always go back to how they are. Make your plan, get your proof and walk away. The plan being very important in order to get out safely.

5801,T6018,t2_6imyc65e,"An abuser will never admit he is the one causing abuse. Don't let his words get to you and keep yourself grounded when something feels wrong or abusive. It's probably because abuse is happening. Trust your intuition. 

But the fact that he is threatening to kill himself is abuse, he is using that as a way to become the victim and make it seems like you are causing him harm when in reality you are just trying to express your feelings and you have every right to do that. He is just mad and defensive because people don't like to get called out on their bullshit. 

I would suggest reaching a domestic violence hotline and get their expert opinion on what your next move can be and how you can keep yourself safe. You might want to express this to a close confidant, they will validate your feelings and it's safer for you if someone else is aware of the abuse. Plus it's not healthy to bottle these things up.

In regards, to your education even if it were to be the case that you didn't get into medical school you can always keep applying or apply for a masters program that can help you boost your GPA. but you can always take a gap year. There is nothing wrong with taking a gap year many people do it and benefit from it so much more than going straight into their next diploma. If you do choose this route you can focus on getting your money up and looking for a small studio to move out to. 

Also if you are going to get another bank account I would suggest Chase because they have a free account for students that are in college. I am currently with Chase and their student account, it is so much more convenient and completely free.

Most of what I’ve read I’ve gone looking for as an outsider wanting to be as supportive as possible for a friend of mine. There was the “I Am Blindsided By This Are We Sure Hes Not Just an Alcoholic” phase, and the “How Can I Still Be Supportive Now That She’s Letting Him Back in Her Life?” phase. 

For phase one I read “Why Does He Do That?” which describes what abusive behavior looks like and som insight into why it happens. For phase 2 I read “Helping Her Get Free: A Guide for Families and Friends is Abused Women”, which I found incredibly helpful when she started talking about how he had changed. It guided me towards figuring out how to phrase my apprehension about him without also rendering judgement, and prevented me from alienating her like a lot of our well-intentioned friends did. It also gives advice on how you can interact with him, if that’s a thing you might have to do. 

It doesn’t sound like you’re in either of these situations, and my recommendations might are generally geared towards abusive romantic relationships so probably there are better resources out there for you. But just thought I’d mention the second phase specifically, just in case.

If you can, please do so. I would also check out if you can file a police complaint re the abusive behaviour. Having a record of alex behaving in a violent, threatening and unstable manner is something that could save yours, taylors or some future persons life. 

Alex sounds like someone who is ill in some way, be that a narc, bpd or bipolar. Ive been involved with all 3 in the past and it looked/felt like this. It does not however justify abuse. Get away from them, report them, reach out to taylor as support if they need it and drop rope with Alex.

5851,renbuns,t2_1dwuy98n," Up until now I had been living in a domestically abusive household. As a kid, I was blinded by my family’s toxic beliefs, but over the years, growing from experience, I had conditioned myself to steer away from developing their behaviors. They wanted me to follow their insane beliefs, and if I tried to go against their beliefs I’d be met with their mistreatment. I hid a lot of my life from them so I wouldn’t receive that backlash. But I still kept going back to them for support, and I accepted my fate that I would always be their puppet.

That was until I met so many wonderful people that helped me believe I had the power to leave them! Even though I had the power and support to leave my toxic household, there are a lot of people in those similar situations that can’t leave. During my lowest times truly thought that would be my outcome, that I would forever be bound by chains if I tried to escape. With my film, I really wanted to show that vulnerable side of myself. Although I, and many others, wish Ruby could have a happy ending as well, I hope my film could help others reach out to those who are in need of that power, or those who need that power to reach out to others.",1591331063,fsxtlp0,t3_gwxoe8,/r/domesticviolence/comments/gwxoe8/for_my_senior_film_i_made_an_animation_based_on/fsxtlp0/,1,domesticviolence,comment

I would recommend calling a resource hotline in your area to see if there are any other shelters that are taking clients right now, maybe even if one is a little farther away. I can’t speak for your area but some of them offer help with transportation to get there if you don’t have it. 
What’s most important to consider right now is thinking about what you can do. Did they go through safety planning with you? Do you have any friends or relatives in the area that you could go to if things did get dangerous? You have $150, that’s good and important to keep safe in case you do really need it.
Many DV shelters are being extra careful with their bed space due to COVID-19.

6308,RiveRain,t2_ucm3o,"Which country are you in? Does your kabin grant you the right to talaq/ divorce your husband? Are Muslim marriages in your country regulated by the Shariah? 

I know how we are raised influences greatly how we identify violence and abuse. And as you are raised in abuse, it might be harder for you than others to protect yourself. But just trust me, you are not responsible for the beating. Even if your words/ actions trigger him, he always has the option to walk away. He chose not to. He will do it again. Do you want this to be your life? Tomorrow, if you have a child, do you want to raise them in a household like this? 

I know the scriptures say it’s not good to confront/ contradict/ argue with your husband. But even if you’re in the wrong, god sees everything and he’s the only one to judge you. Your husband doesn’t have the right to punish you. So please, please stop thinking that you have any responsibility in the abuse/ the beating is justified. We all have our flaws. But nobody deserves to be abused or live under the shadow of violence because of that. You deserve better. You are capable of having a good life.

This Covid situation is hard for the mental health of everybody, so at the first place you have to be in a safe place. Depending on your location, please see which one fits your needs better, a Muslim women’s shelter, or just a general one. 

As long as you live with him I won’t suggest you to restrict his access into your finances, because that might further infuriate him. But what happened to your mohrana? Even if you don’t have that now, if the shelter you take help from works with Muslim marriages, they can help you get hold of that money. That should give you at least a few days help. 

I would suggest you while you live under the same roof, do a lot of research on the women’s organizations around you, and how to prepare to live in a women’s shelter for a while. Also maybe look into the mindfulness/ relaxation techniques, and just try to walk away whenever things start to get heated.",1591209107,fsrvabz,t3_gvqbfq,/r/domesticviolence/comments/gvqbfq/my_husband_keeps_hitting_me_i_dont_know_what_to_do/fsrvabz/,3,domesticviolence,comment
6309,princessxmombi,t2_5rjkvnx4,"This man is not only a violent abuser, but he is a rapist and thief. You don’t ever owe him sex just because he is your husband. The use of a weapon and fact that he’s strangled you means it is much more likely that he will eventually kill you. 

I agree, get out before kids are involved. Three years probably feels like a long time, but those of us who were in abusive relationships for much longer look back and WISH we’d gotten out after only a few years. It gets so much harder the longer you wait. 

First thing, open another bank account and savings account and change your direct deposit information at your job so the money stops going to him. If you think your family will be at all sympathetic if they find out how violent and sexually abusive he is, go stay with them. If they won’t be, ask a friend or contact your local women’s shelter. Press charges on him and get a restraining order. If he goes to jail, find his bank account information and take back all the money that’s yours. Get your own place and don’t give the address out to anyone you can’t fully trust not to share it with him. See if there are any support groups in your area specifically for Muslim women who have dealt with domestic violence. It may help to be around other women who’ve not only dealt with the violence you have, but understand your cultural and religious background, and how this may affect the level of support your receive from family. 

It doesn’t matter that you argue with him. His actions are not deserved and he’d find a reason to treat you this way, even if you were a perfect angel.

1.  Do not get pregnant

2.  Don't have sex with him.  If he forces it, don't risk death but let him leave marks so when you report it as rape they'll believe you.

3.  Open a separate account and forward your next paycheck there instead, or remove him from your account as an active user, be specific and TELL your bank, it's all confidential.  That way, if he accesses your account you can have him arrested for bank fraud and recover your money.

4.  Once you have the financial backing, next time he gets violent, report him for ALL of it.  In the US choking is a fellony.

5.  Be ready to change your locks.  It's easy, look it up on youtube, all it takes is a screw driver and 10 minutes.  Feel free to ask a friendly neighbor or co-worker who knows how if you feel the need.  A lot of building superintendents do this for free as well so they'll still have a key or they will just change part of the lock so you need a new key.  As a guy that knows how to do this, on behalf of all such guys we gladly do it for free just to get the ego boost that we have valuable skills.  -. he will need a police escort to get back in, and will be arrested if he tries to force it open, because there has been violence and he voluntarily left CONGRATS, it's now yours (be adamant, YOU have no where else to go, maybe add that he smelled like another woman last time, cheap tactic but effective).  In the US he will still have to pay his portion of the rent too.


I'm of the mindset to solve problems first, deal with the feelings later.  I also don't think you should go too far avoiding confrontation.  

When you talk to the cops, Don't start with ""I knew I shouldn't say it"" or ""I kept yelling at him"" or ""he seemed sorry"", or even ""but I love him"".  He was violent, and even children learn words don't justify fists let alone choking.  You need to be clear, he broke the law, he is a criminal, they need to follow those laws.  You are not in the wrong so you don't have to flee, you don't have to hide, it's on the cops to afford you protection from a known threat that's been violent.

6322,SeattleCouple626,t2_153nmp2j,"Im sorry but I have to say something about this. While I agree with you to a certain degree that this OP should have and could have done more, a  lot more to try to protect their child, even asking a reader of this sub to call the police or cps on their behalf, I do not agree with how you delivered  your point. 

You said you are a survivor of domestic abuse, as well as child abuse. It’s not my place to question that, but you better then any average reader on here will know the complexities that surround an environment and marriage that is ruled by violence and abuse. You know that these situations are never a simple black and white issues, and that there are tons of layers of grey when going into how to make decisions when you’re a victim of domestic violence. I’m not saying to condone ops decision, I agree completely that she had more options at her disposal, ones that might not have been a direct danger to her physical well being. 

My biggest problem with your comment comes from how you say you are a survivor of both child and domestic abuse, but yet you show absolutely no compassion or offer any ways to help her!! You instead harshly judged her on her situation when you know you have no where near close to all the information. This woman made a mistake, however her daughter at that moment was not dead. While I commend you for the things you did to survive your situation with your abusers and protect those who you loved and were more vulnerable then you, I’m sure you can think back to something you chose to do during a heated moment or complex situation caused by your abuser, and now you can see the other options that you had available, but couldn’t see at that time. If someone  you told what was going on, obviously hypothetical here, similar to how OP did here, and the responses you got were all condemning you as a horrible person, mother, etc. claiming you were just as horrible as your abuser, I think you can understand how not only unhelpful that would be, but also cruel. 

This OP clearly is dealing with a complex personal dilemma, one that causes her to feel terrible no matter what she does. She very clearly hates on herself already in her post for feeling so scared to go against her husband, even if it’s in the best interest and livelihood of her child. Just because you were able to take the beatings for your siblings at times did not mean you weren’t terrified. No victim experiences their abuse the same way physically, mentally, or emotionally, so while it’s great that you were able to do these things, what good is it doing comparing you and your abuse to OP and hers? It’s also just unfair to judge her so harshly for her fear. I agree that it might be hard to understand OP’s decision, and why she thinks it’s too risky sneaking her daughter food at the times she helps her to the bathroom or something like that. However, none of us are living her situation or are experiencing her abuse, so we don’t have the right to judge that decision, despite the many people here who have done just that. OP’s post is definitely very difficult to understand. As sad as it might be to react this way, I understand why many of the comments said what they said, especially since I’d say most of those people who wrote those have nothing in their lives that can even come close to being relatable to what OP has been experiencing. Your comment  bothered me most because as a fellow survivor of a violent abusive relationship, and one who grew up in a household where domestic violence was common, you do understand, at least to certain degree what OP is going through. I’m not saying you understand her thought process right now with her daughter, but you can relate better then most of the other people who left comments, if not all of them. This could have been a chance to offer a life line and offer to help her. Hell, you could still have shown frustration towards her, but instead of ending your post dripping in hatred and a clear sense that you think you’re better then her, you could have chosen to say almost anything else and it would have been better. There were multiple options you could have offered her as suggestions that could have gotten OPs daughter help that same night. 

As a survivor of domestic abuse your experience should be something you share to help show those who are still trapped that while it may be hard, and at times even dangerous, it’s possible to get out and start over. I want to be 100% clear that I only have the utmost respect for your journey out of the abuse you experienced and to where you are now. All survivors of domestic violence have been through something requiring an insane amount of bravery and perseverance, and not everyone is able to get to where you have. You have every right to feel proud of overcoming that. But I take issue with anyone who believes that how they over came the challenges and traumas of their life, or just that they were able to overcome them at all, somehow makes these individuals better then others currently facing the same challenges in some way, shape, or form.

6326,SeattleCouple626,t2_153nmp2j,"I completely agree with you. I said that in my first post. I’m not try to say you should have been able to understand her because she was scared. I was saying you admitted to being a survivor of domestic abuse, therefore that should give you some ability to relate. Relate doesn’t mean understand necessarily. I can’t really think of any reason why it was necessary at all to say what you said to OP. Maybe if you hadn’t included that you had been through domestic abuse as well as child abuse, then I probably would have viewed your comment like the others. 
I am sorry you had to suffer as a child and there was no one to protect you or your siblings, that is never ok. I can see how your childhood experiences would effect the way you would look at this situation. Again, I do not condone OP’s decision either. However, where you and I differ is  that I can see that OP is a victim who already blamed herself and wanted help. Again, I can’t see any reason for leaving a comment like that except to tear a person down. You chose to berate and judge a victimized woman who was trying to get help. If your experiences from your childhood triggered such intense anger, then just don’t comment. Why would the OP write this post, where she already called herself out for how her fear has incapacitated her from being able to act effectively, unless she was trying to seek out help? Obviously, she was aware of how this made her look as a mother and person, and yet she still posted it because it was at least one way if acting to try and get help. You have no more right to claim you’re better then her then I do. Neither of us have experienced what her life is like and therefore her abuse. I feel sorry for you if you can’t understand that even a little bit.

You're probably scared and angry.

Abusers are already thinking ""let's not get caught"".  They know it's wrong, but they don't feel wrong so they feel entitled to avoid consequence at all cost.  You'll see them say things like ""I restrained my wife so she didn't hurt herself, it was scary"" or ""I used the minimum force needed to subdue her"" 

They will often make mistakes because their version of events is built on fantasy, so if you break things down to who got physical when, the abuser usually sets them up for example not letting them leave so they throw things, or denying them access to a phone or car keys and saying that the victim attacked them when they were going for their property required to escape.

Ifs impressive that you pretty much have a outline of the steps you need to take and some hurdles you may have to jump over. I’m thinking that you should call a domestic abuse hotline in your area. You could do e-mail if your Dad is around so he wouldn’t hear your conversation. Make sure to create a new e-mail account with a password he doesn’t know and clear your history after your done, Once’s things get set in motion he may sense something is up and start snooping around. They also do messaging and live confidential virtual chats. A gal in here spent two hours chatting with someone from her local DV help line and it empowered her to leave because they helped with the when, why and how’s. 

I don’t know where in the country you live but often times there are subsidized housing for people and financially that would help you so much. And dogs aren’t as hard to get into retails as they used to be. You can maybe get a letter from your current landlord about how good he/she is. 
You  also can see if you qualify for the Snap program, (food stamps) assistance with cell phones and internet. There are just a lot of resources out there. A DV person can help you ladies navigate through all that so that you have a safe and solid exit plan. They can also help you with how to deal with your Dad during the transition. 

I’m exited for y’all. I know you can do this and it will be such a weight lifted and it will be a brand new world.

I am not sure where you live, but check out any DV hotlines in your area. They will sometimes do an assessment over the phone and give you options. They are a great starting point to get right direction.

Sometimes they can refer you to a shelter. I know not everyone is crazy about shelters BUT (in some places) once you're in a shelter, you can have access to many programs.

I’m happy you at least see the cycle because that reminds you that every time he’s sweet is only so that the next time he can be just that tiny bit more controlling, more aggressive, hurt you just a bit more. Love does not hurt. What you are experiencing is generally called trauma bonding. And he most certainly doesn’t love you. People who love us do not put cigarettes out on us. People who love us want us to have full happy lives with other people who love and support us. People who love us don’t manipulate us until we can’t figure out which way is up or down. 

You can do this. Find “Why Does He Do That?,” by Lundy Bancroft. It’s available online for free. It’s one of the best books on how abusers operate.

No healthy or sane person wants control over another, because they should be tired just sorting their plate full of personal problems, they shouldn't want yours.

I recommend becoming familiar with the laws because one of the hardest battles to win is CORRECTING your beliefs about right/wrong/legal.

No shame, but if our opinions or instincts were correct, most of us would have seen the flags and avoided the situation.  We didn't, but going along or winging it, or even trusting a lawyer isn't the answer, it's education.

I even read about a guy with severe vitiligo who was basically turning white one skin cell at a time and decided it was less makeup to just turn white (he was a tv presenter).  That's change.

I've never known of someone to develop the ability to fly, time travel, become a unicorn, or stop being a violent piece of shit.  That's not change, that's a metamorphosis into something else.

Best you can hope is for an abuser to develop a life time fear of jail or the consequences of getting caught, but when they turn violent they aren't usually in control enough to rationalize that anyway.  Good luck scaring/shaming/convincing an abuser so thoroughly that they remember it forever, because I do not think ANY of them are going to fundamentally change 1.). Their desire to abuse or 2.). The entitlement that they feel to abuse others when they are in that state or 3.)  Their willingness to go to any lengths to avoid accepting responsibility or consequences or repair the damage they have done, beyond minimization of personal consequences.

I think in the end they would all be diagnosed with personality disorders or something we haven't clinically defined yet, which can be summed up as ""shitty person"", which as a category are virtually impossible to treat because it's fundamental to how they work.",1591120374,fsnoon9,t3_gva1sz,/r/domesticviolence/comments/gva1sz/questions_about_my_neighbour_can_people_change/fsnoon9/,1,domesticviolence,comment

Leaving a narcissistic abuser is hard because of something called intermittent reinforcement. If you remember anything about Pavlov and his dogs, it has to do with that.

I loved him, my goodness I loved him but my sanity was teetering. I found refuge with my Mom. About a week into the separation I was ready to go home. He was saying all the right things and I felt horrible...how could I leave him?? 

My Mom offered me this advice - give it 90 days. If in 90 days you’re still convinced he’s the man you want to be with I’ll support you 100%. 

Personally, I would stay away - if you are able to - for a set amount of time, then reevaluate your feelings. Right now you’re in the flurry of the relationship - he’s love bombing you. He will say anything to get you back. Giving yourself some true distance will enable your mind to clear and you can objectively look at the relationship. 

Leaving my ex-husband was the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do. I truly loved him. I believed we could withstand any hurdles in our relationship - but the truth is he was an abusive narcissist.

I left my relationship with my ex and my son's father about three months ago and due to quarantine The Domestic Violence Shelter here is full and all the other ones are saying they can't take in. It's like what do you supposed to do? Just stay there and deal with the abuse or leave and risk being found? I think they're finally starting to open back up but honestly I think it's bullshit.

 There's been people who have been there since before quarantine started and I think that they should give a chance for some new people to be able to get help. It's bulshit that we can't get help because of quarantine. Like couldn't they put people on the floor on mattresses or something? We're basically just being told oh well, there's nothing we can do.

Edit: I've been in a hotel myself due to moving out and hiding from my ex. Of course I didn't tell him where I was living but he somehow started to figure it out, probably because he knows IT very well and I found out he was tracking my phone so I had to get a new one so I've been spending all my money on a hotel to protect my son and myself. If they find out you're in a hotel they tell you that your risk isn't great enough. You basically have to be on the street or have your abuser almost kill you for them to help you. It's bullshit. 

I've also had people tell me that they went back after being in shelter in that when they left again that the shelter was very reluctant to give them services again. They are trained to know that a victim will leave their abuser on average seven times before it's sticks so I don't see why this happens. They seriously need to overhaul their policies.

Edit 2: I've heard that sometimes they will pay for a hotel in an extreme situation and I think that having a child with you is a pretty extreme situation. Every time I've asked about this they've told me no, we don't do that or it has to be very dire. Like what the fuck do they consider dire? Like what, does your abuser have to be standing there about ready to kill you for them to do anything? The whole system is bullshit and like I said it needs to seriously be overhauled.

I can’t blame my friends for giving up, it took years and how much can you stand to see someone you care for being hurt and lying to you about it? I can certainly blame my friends who didn’t believe me, took his side over mine, even though they were simply conned by the same con artist I was. 

But family is a different story. I tried to make shit work with my mom for three years, right up till she said she would do exactly as my abusive ex had done: call the police, lie and say I hit her. I got arrested, but all charges dropped because she couldn’t keep her story straight. If that’s not manipulating my trauma to be used against me, I don’t know what is. Regardless, that woman is dead to me. 

It takes time to rebuild relationships. Personally, I learned to really enjoy being alone and am finally trying to work on myself, now that I’ve finally stopped vying for my mother’s unattainable love and approval. 

If family wants to put requirements and conditions on their relationships with you shortly after (as in, within several years) you’ve left an abusive relationship, it sounds like they may just want to keep things the way they were: abusive.

7303,cocoperrier,t2_6kha0bn4,"I know that for me it has helped, for example I started going to the gym and I specifically use that time that I’ve set aside at the gym and focus on what causes me anger and for me physically getting it out of my body is helpful and I’ve found that it has lessened the anger I feel at other times.

Another thing you could try is creating a “parking lot”. So when a thought comes to you that you know will take you down that spiral you write it (park it) down in your “parking lot” (a note on your phone or an actual piece of paper) and then you move on to a different thought. Then when you’re in a better space you make sure that you go back to your parking lot and address your thoughts, for me oftentimes when I go back to a thought in a different moment it doesn’t feel as powerful if that makes sense.

These are just things that have worked for me but you have to find what’s best for you. I know you said you listen to music while doing housework but maybe try something that has to keep more of your attention like a tv show or an audiobook or calling a friend on the phone, I find that distracting myself in the moment and coming back later is what has worked best for me. Hope that you find some of this helpful, the fact that you’re here asking for how to get past your anger makes me sure that you’ll find what works for you.",1591029032,fsjfsib,t1_fsjenk0,/r/domesticviolence/comments/gukh9v/how_to_calm_the_anger/fsjfsib/,1,domesticviolence,comment

My friends have been really supportive and a few of our mutual friends have reinforced the idea that I was in an abusive/gaslighting relationship.

You will eventually realize when you look back that they were hiding their true selves the whole time until they couldnt any more and nothing will bring back that first bit when everything was great. That honeymoon period of fun and happiness with those type of people are a combination of them being on their best behavior and you not knowing their bullshit yet. Then they get comfortable and the real them comes out and only goes away when they hurt you somehow and need to make sure you dont leave but then shows up every single time no matter what they say.

The way you know your partners a keeper is no matter how they are feeling, sad, depressed, angry or happy they always think of you and treat you almost as great as the first day. Of course there are fights but if they fight dirty and act childish by saying mean things meant to hurt you on purpose that will only escalate later on in the relationship.

No one deserves to be disrespected and there are too many people on this planet that will treat you the right way to be with the few that wont treat you well!

And it gets worse. Trust me.

My man was good 80 % of the time too.

Except that's like saying, ""oh this drink is absolutely delicious, it's 80% awesomeness and the 20% is poison, but it's okay because it tastes great.""

Let me tell you a little secret about that poison. It doesn't cause damage right away, that's the allure... It erodes and causing huge damage over time. Slowly you it consumes you. It takes away your self esteem, your healthy safety, freedoms, and any stability you wish to have (house, family or career). You can't have your happiness and an abusive man at the same time. It's a daily balancing act that 100% never ever works.

I've been with a man like that for 15 years. It escalates. And the abuse will always always get worse if you have children with this man. Then not only are you drinking that poison, but your baby will be too.

After reading your story, I honestly wouldn't put it past him, if he ended up doing something a little worse down the road 

Listen, no one can tell you what to do, or how to live your life. But I will say this, I know you don't want to leave him, so please please please safety plan. In the event something happens, you should be prepared and educated on your next steps.

Have access to a domestic shelter and numbers ahead of time. Always have a plan in an emergency. Also remember that abusers don't change. I've highly recommend Lundy Bancrofts PDF, ""why does he do that"" - it's free online. An eye opening.

I always thought my love and care for my abuser would change him....or therapy, or books, or other people, maybe church, or anger management.

He would always seem like he was getting better. But in reality, he never got better, just smarter at pulling the wool over everyone's eyes.

The abuse started small and 15 years and a few children later, I'm living in a shelter, trying to start our life over. I also found out that if I didn't leave him, after I had to get a VPO, the state could take my kids away too. They don't deserve to witness the abuse and I'll be damned if my daughter had a husband like her father. I'll also never lose my kids for anyone. Ever.

If you can I'd probably move somewhere else, without your boyfriend. Then get some therapy before you consider getting into another relationship, these things can get much worse

P.s. My previously abusive partner hid my keys regularly. I felt it was worse than her hitting me, emotionally taking my freedom is so much worse than any physical pain.

 she constantly invaded my privacy by going through my things when I wasn't home. She ate my food without shame and didn't replace it and when I finally got mad and said something to her, she would start calling me names. She also attempted to Gaslight me on several occasions.

7321,kwagenknight,t2_opzwo,"This is the best answer so far. Both are being abusive towards eachother but on both sides there is NO reason to put your hands on someone or do some of the things they are doing to each other. Its not OPs fault in the slightest that the bf is abusing her but she really needs to look at her actions as they are extremely unhealthy for a relationship and when she gets in one with a good guy who wont abuse her she may ruin the relationship with her behavior.

Also like you said they both need therapy and to work on themselves to know what is a healthy relationship and it very well could have been the bf's behavior that has caused OP to act out this way but after saying that its her responsibility to act in a healthy manner and not act out and instead communicate properly her feelings and emotions as her next partner is probably able to actually communicate unlike her present bf.

Tldr; OP needs to take responsibility for her actions and get therapy but that by no means gives the bf any right to do anything besides communicate his disgust of the situation and leave. Anything else, esp putting his hands on OP or getting violent or aggressive towards or around her is absolutely not her fault and the sole responsibility of his actions lies with the bf.

In my experience, closure and self-forgiveness are vital to truly move on. You need an outlet for your anger, I like video games personally, but you also need the opportunity to say what you need to say in retrospect.

I DO NOT suggest you confront him, but I’ve found a nice way for me to get closure, which is by writing. Write a letter/email with everything you want to say to him, don’t hold back, but don’t send it. If the idea of it being unsent is bothersome, try r/unsentletters and post it there.

Finally, forgive yourself.

Except I got married and had children. Fast forward 12 years later and I'm having breakfast in a domestic violent shelter, waiting on assistance to get moved out. It's not easy here either.

So mine went from punching holes in the wall to screaming to breaking larger items, destroying my property to suicide threats with a gun.

Hard facts. It gets worse. The longer you stay the worse it gets. And that sad routine and the sweet sensitive guy? Absolutely fake. I know it's hard to believe or understand but behind closed doors, the truth comes out. And over time, it gets scarier. Also, if you get pregnant - the abuse gets worse.

Please research the domestic violence wheel and read Lundy Bancrofts ""Why does he do that"" it's free and it's a shocking look on the inside of their minds.

Please get out while you can, you have no children or commitments with this person.. Yes it could be codependency and let your therapist know about what's going on. But know, you don't deserve that behavior regardless.

7815,opeaum,t2_4s7d3pq9,"Those whole thing was intense from start to finish. I got really wrapped up in reading it as it all sounded a little too familiar. 

You see, this is how my mother is to my father. She would use him for money, a place, the labor to set up said place and then would kick him out and bring over some other man. Someone with more money usually as it was never about love or even sex with my mother, just money. 

This went on for over a decade before my mom got proposed to; mind you, not for the first time, but I suppose for the first time she felt like this is the “one”, aka the one who would financially support her forever. Though I can’t say my mother ever had a thing with a cousin, the men she chooses aren’t great either. Currently she’s with a man who has a dying wife at home, he’s cheating on her with my mother because apparently now that his wife is terminally ill she can’t “satisfy him”. 

This all drove my father to insanity because they had kids together (6 girls to be exact) and that was always his reason for staying. Plus, whenever my mothers boyfriends would leave her after discovering that she’s insane, she would go running to him and would pretend to love him again. 

It was all very hard to watch as you can imagine. My father used to be very normal and mild tempered. Even as a kid I remember it was my mother who did most of the disciplining, she was the hardass and he couldn’t really be mean, at least not for long. 

Now he’s a very angry person. Very psychically and verbally abusive. He’s extremely explosive. He’s started drinking and smoking weed all the time, and recently got arrested for attempting to fight the neighbor while drunk. He cannot hold a job anymore.  

The kind of woman you’re describing is a lot like my mother. Cold, naive, preverse, and narcissistic. A woman like that can only do harm. Leave as soon as possible. It may be hard but it’s better than spending the rest of your life angry and growing angrier.",1590961708,fsgoijc,t3_gtrna2,/r/domesticviolence/comments/gtrna2/caught_girlfriend_cheating_in_chat_she_pulled_a/fsgoijc/,1,domesticviolence,comment

 I also feel guilt because of his mental health issues. His older sister (who I found out later he lived with for a while), and his mom seem to have been just trying to appease him/deal with him for a long time. His sister told me they had to get him committed before, and a few years ago he had a blowout fight with her over a truck he was borrowing from them. He apparently rammed the truck into the back of her car that was parked in their driveway and kicked the doors causing dents. She didn't want to call the police.

 He's had some mental breaks since then and one night it was so bad I was looking for the mental health emergency line but was too afraid to call (I should have called.) He was ranting so loudly about things about Hitler, Lou Gerhigs disease?, people spying on him, etc. and was/is paranoid that our upstairs neighbor was spying on him (also that the government is spying on him.) I just couldn't handle it and told him to go out for a walk. I was hoping someone would hear him and call in assistance, but no one did.

I guess I just have to take it one day at a time and be easy on myself.  The police gave me the number to the local crisis intervention agency to get a protection order put into place, so I will call them and have them walk me through everything. I guess I am most worried now about the whole issue with him moving out and him (or a relative) getting his stuff.

8297,a5121221a,t2_atd2z,"Pressing charges will not be your choice.  It is the choice of the prosecutor.  You have the choice to testify or not.  Your choice not to testify may impact the prosecutor's decision, but it is still the prosecutor's decision.  If they have enough evidence without your testimony, they can still go forward.  If you choose to testify in court, it will be hard.  It was for me and I think it is for most victims (my testimony wasn't for criminal court, it was for a PPO, but it's still hard).  It is hard to tell the truth in a room with your abuser and also full of strangers, but it can result in consequences for your abuser so you might be in less danger going forward and you might just help another person that never becomes his victim because you were brave enough to testify.  

Without regard to the courts, a security system might be a very good choice for you right now.  I got Frontpoint when I was afraid a stalker would return to my home (he continued stalking me after a sexual assault PPO was in place).  Frontpoint is nice because the sensors are wireless (wireless in the house and the system connects to cell towers instead of a phone line or internet) and the sensors are installed with adhesive instead of screws, so it is rental-friendly.  The sensors are z-wave technology, so you can buy them from Frontpoint or buy anything that is z-wave.  I got my initial package from frontpoint, then bought a few on auction from eBay until all of my doors and windows were protected with sensors that detect if they open and also with glass-break sensors.  The only disadvantage to third-party or used sensors is that Frontpoint won't replace them if they fail.  The other thing nice about Frontpoint is the smash-and-crash protection.  The system sends a soft signal when a door opens, then if the code isn't entered, it alarms, even if someone was to smash the control unit.  That means police come even if an intruder destroys the control unit.  I'm sure there are other brands that do all the same things, too.  My system has made me feel much more secure,  and maybe, just maybe, the sign in my yard or signs on my windows were enough to keep the guy from trying to break in if he ever showed up again.  I'll never know, but I'm still alive and safe.",1590850795,fsb7x62,t3_gt92o4,/r/domesticviolence/comments/gt92o4/the_best_revenge_is_to_survive/fsb7x62/,1,domesticviolence,comment
8298,metalman675triple,t2_5nwcoajm,"I'd leave the race issue alone, but if we are going there....

About 4 women a day are MURDERED by their partner.  Cops kill a bit under 3 per day of all races.  Less than one per day of them is black, like .55, and the vast majority of them are justified (sorry, but true)

So...women are being murdered per capita at roughly the same rate black criminals are being killed BUT

WOMEN ARE OVER 30 TIMES AS LIKELY TO BE MURDERED BY THEIR PARTNER THAN AN INNOCENT BLACK PERSON IS LIKELY TO BE MURDERED BY A COP.

Shave those down to the target populations by eliminating single women, elderly and children, and that number shoots up over 100 easily.

Flip side, drunk driving kills 10 times as many people annually, about 10,000, or roughly 5 times as many women as DV, but there are over 20k hotline calls per day for DV and it's very under reported.


Having said all that, small towns suck for this stuff, but you should have called the cops right then and there.  You didn't, which I can understand but maybe your friends can't.  If they never saw marks, they never heard about it from you before, then why would they believe you months after the fact when he stayed and you left?  Happened to me when I was getting divorced, not only did she lie to our friends about me being violent, she attacked me with my own crutches the day I  got home from a knee surgery.

It was a gift because it got rid of friends I didn't want.  Six month later when she broke in and robbed my appliances when I was out of town with the same friends help, I got to make them come over and give my stuff back while their husbands begged for their lives.  They all still leave when I show up anyplace, and the friends I kept I value more for it.

Not trying to beat you up, but victims need to call the cops immediately, they may not do it right or help much, but at least you will have documentation of it and you can fight from there.

8305,SixSpeedin,t2_169zw9,"You said it. They’re “woke”, in quotes! It’s not genuine compassion or empathy. It’s narcissism and a desire to be seen as the “savior” masked in the cloak of “social justice warrior”. It’s all too common for narcissistic people to be hyper involved in the community. It inflates their sense of self. Best believe you’re going to hear about their “efforts” though (it’ll be publicized all over social media and talked about plenty). As much as these people are posting about George Floyd, reflect on how much of an ally were they to black people before it was trending on social media again? If this is how they are responding to your situation, the likelihood is they are not the vigilant warriors of justice that they have made themselves out to be. Being an Ally to people of color is about human rights, no? Well, being an ally to domestic abuse survivors also comes down to human rights as well. If they support or condone one but not the other, something ain’t right. That’s some major cognitive dissonance! 

On a different note, I’m really sorry that this happened to you and it’s highlighted the true colors of not only the man you married, but your friend group as well. As a DV survivor and single mama, I promise you its going to get so much better from here! It’s hard to FEEL it right now, but truthfully you’ve been done a favor and the universe cleared your life of major garbage that has been sucking your life force dry. It’ll come with its challenges of course, but it’s a beautiful thing to ONLY have you and your child to focus on. No fucking body else lol. Take this time to really really get to know yourself. Do all the things that make you feel happy, safe, healthy, loved, beautiful and powerful. The more time you spend doing that, you’ll soon find you attract in new and more aligned people. People who match the newer, more empowered and healed version of yourself and your precious little family. 

One thing that always helps me is to just stand in my truth and be unwavering about it. When I left my abusive ex, his family members who called me “sister” and told me they “love Me” for years, suddenly iced me out and made out to be the bad guy. They knew he was abusive (in hindsight my life was truly at risk with him with his abuse and it’s a miracle I’m still alive), unfaithful, manipulative and not even helping physically or financially with his infant child, and yet I was somehow in the wrong when I left.. because i wanted a healthier me and lifestyle for my precious son. That hurt so bad but I just had to stand strong for me and learn to detach from expectations of anyone. Of people to me kind and fair and logical. What’s most important in all that is, that their actions are in no way a reflection of you. Your worth, value, validity. Anything. It’s simple of reflection of them, so good riddance. 

I don’t know if that helped but I hope you know that you’re not alone and this is a blessing in disguise. My life has done a 180 since leaving all the abusive and toxic people behind, and I know for certain yours will too! As long as you focus on loving yourself and your kiddo sooooo damn unconditionally and enjoy the little moments everyday together, you’ll soon come to realize life is a lot more magical and beautiful than those energy-vampires around you have allowed you to perceive. 💚",1590869226,fsch1r5,t3_gtei84,/r/domesticviolence/comments/gtei84/ignored_by_social_justice_warrior_friends/fsch1r5/,1,domesticviolence,comment

On the other hand- I think it’s kind of offensive to call people “Social justice warriors.” Some “friends” won’t ever get what you’re going through-and that has nothing to do with their views on race. 
It has to do with them as a person. 

I’d also advise against drawing parallels between relationship abuse and racism. 

I totally understand that that video triggered feelings in you. It was horrifying to watch and I’m sure even worse to experience. But Society is much more likely to believe a white womans abuse than a black or Hispanic woman. 

A good example of this is that woman in Central Park who called the cops on the guy who was bird watching. She KNEW the cops would believe HER before believing Him bc he was Black. 

So while I empathize with you, you still have privileges that women of color don’t have. (Assuming you’re white)

8310,SilverReference1,t2_58sd74r9,"Aw thank you for the kind words! 

So some of this may not apply to you, it depends in what state you live in. But here goes:

Really the objective is to get away from dad, I think the obvious approach of just having him arrested is fine- but won't be great long term as let's face it, judged will give him a slap on the wrist and maybe a suspended sentence at best. I know, this sucks. Which means he will come home and be furious, which only makes things more unsafe for you.

I guess my aim in this situation would be to have you be adopted due to the violence in the house. I know this is very extreme and scary for a 16 year old, but I think it's really the only long term solution as they are unlikely to put dad in jail for 10 years- again useless justice system.

So this does require either you to report the situation or have someone else do it for you, and insist that you cannot live with your parents any longer and want to be adopted. I would pray and hope that the powers that be them organise the same for your siblings too. 

The ways things can get indirectly reported is if you visit a doctor with injuries from violence, they are mandated reporters/ tell your teachers or student counsellors.

If you feel safe enough to do so you can go directly to a police station and request to speak to someone from their domestic violence unit or if you live in Victoria you can find your local ""orange door"" if you Google this, it's a one stop shop for victims on violence and you can simply go on for advice and it won't cost you anything.
If this isn't available in your state, maybe Google a way of discreetly contacting your local social services and see what advice they can give.

I wish I was as brave as you, I was too afraid to report and live with that guilt everyday- I wish I could have saved my younger siblings from the same fate. I realised that for me if I reported, he would have killed me- not even exaggerating or being dramatic but he literally would have done it. So my goal was just to get educated get a job and get the hell out of there- but if you arnt in fear of your life I would say please consider the adoption route. You deserve a normal family that will allow you to have a childhood.

I wish I could do more for you, praying you find safety and please please let me know how things go and what you decide to do.",1590874921,fscwmv3,t1_fsb2c72,/r/domesticviolence/comments/gte51y/i_need_advice_on_what_to_do_please/fscwmv3/,1,domesticviolence,comment

If you aren't going to therapy I strongly suggest it. It can help unpack a lot of things that are ingrained into our thinking from the relationship. Your neighbors sound great for calling someone, many times I think people don't usually want to get involved.

8321,MariaDV29,t2_6h6qo3dt,"I don’t want to get into discussions on who has it worse, it’s not a competition. We know women are not supported by police for protection against their abusers just like people in BIPOC communities. 

All political affiliations are guilty of misogyny and violence against women. Most of my friends are liberal so of course I would know many liberal men that abuse women. Nobody has a monopoly on misogyny.  We are also in a pandemic and stuck at home so screens are in our faces and how we’re spending so much of our time. Like said above as well, it’s easier to act on a distant cause than it is to put real emotional effort into helping someone close to home. Black folks (and People of Color) recognize how ingenious the social media advocacy is and that many people they see speaking about on social media aren’t doing in real work either &amp; feeling and,  just like you, recognize in that the social media posts are phony. So in that regards, don’t blame the people who have their own problems right now just because they’re the recipients of your friend’s attention.   You’re hurting. It’s very painful to see friends “not want to take sides”. They are not your friends if that’s the position they are taking or demonstrating that by their actions. I live in a smallish town (50-100k) and that’s still too small for me. I want to leave so bad and if my husband doesn’t agree to move soon, I will be leaving (and filing for divorce). I don’t feel safe or supported in my community and I don’t feel my children are not just because of DV but also because of mine and my children’s ethnicity. So everyone please keep intersectional feminism in your minds as we speak -it’s not an either or issue for so many. 

Find your support. Don’t hesitate to reach out to your friends and let them know what’s going on. They won’t know if you don’t tell them. If they don’t support you, then you know exactly where they stand. Neutrality and silence is part of the problem and move on. They are the enablers of abuse and DV. It will be hurt but it also gets the painful of task of wondering who your true friends are.

8325,ImYesILeffHisAss2398,t2_2egrzrvq,"As you know, its pretty terrifying to try to escape Law Enforcement when they are abusive. They know where the shelters and resources are, they have friends, family, coworkers that will cover for them, and its so dangerous to your life and safety. Im so sorry you are going through that.

I would recommend that you do a few things. First, its possible you have a GPS tracker on your vehicle. Second, all of your electronics should be treated as if they have spyware and keyloggers on them not to mention gps locator apps on them hidden. Third, assume all of your accounts have been accessed and are unsafe. So that is terrifying. LEO know the tricks. They know how to hide their tracks. And they watch you to see if you emotionally are pulling away and at risk to leave which will escalate their abuse, which they feel free to take to any lengths because they believe they are safe.

So, this is a horrible time. I dont know if you are already away from him, but assume like I said everything is tracked. So you need a burner phone, new email accounts only accessed by that phone, not to drive the car, and to not be anywhere where his police agency has power. Thats going to me fleeing for a great distance. Carefully. Paying in cash. Without those tracked electronics on you. With back tracking to get away.

I see you have tried so many options right now. I understand you are looking for direct help to get free. Thats not something really available especially when you are talking about a place where he has influence as a cop. I would recommend that you get to a burner phone, and check out [goaskrose.org](https://goaskrose.org). Make sure there is no trail. See what help they can give you. [Domesticshelters.org](https://Domesticshelters.org) may be able to help you if you go far away, but again, you cant talk or communicate with them with current electronics. You have to cover your tracks.

Im so very sorry there arent more resources. It will be safer for the local resources if you are not in the same area or even close. Cross state lines. And dont tip off anyone, not friends or family. He will get to them to get the info. Then you need to protect yourself. There is also \[THIS\]([https://www.domesticshelters.org/articles/escaping-violence/when-your-abuser-is-a-police-officer](https://www.domesticshelters.org/articles/escaping-violence/when-your-abuser-is-a-police-officer)) that may be helpful. There is a person quoted in there from Wisconsin and the   [Sojourner Family Peace Center](http://familypeacecenter.org/) that maybe you can contact for help. Just do it from a safe phone and email account.

Additionally, getting a lawyer can help you figure out how to stay safe from the abuser legally, protect your location for divorce and deal with legal sides of assets, restraining orders, and any other legal way to protect you.

I wish there were more I could recommend. Im so sorry.",1590889269,fsdnc25,t3_gtncqo,/r/domesticviolence/comments/gtncqo/unlisted_resources_please/fsdnc25/,1,domesticviolence,comment

8797,a5121221a,t2_atd2z,"I am not certain what resources a community college has or what jobs they may offer, but my university offered assistance finding employment on campus and had counseling services.  You might check whether your new community college has either of those resources.

Since the summer is starting, subleasing an apartment is often an option in areas where students leave for the summer (i.e. go to their parents' house and work a summer job they had before college).  If your new city has schools other than your community college, check their housing resources in addition to housing resources listed at your community college.  Getting a sublease is often easier than getting a lease because the lease is still in someone else's name.  If the landlord will agree to it and you pay your rent on time, you'll have a reference for future leases.  Sometimes a sublease is done under the table, but that won't get you a reference for future housing.  Another benefit of subleasing is that the apartment/house is often already furnished.    
If subleasing doesn't seem to be an option, look for someone who already has an apartment and wants a roommate.  If they already have the apartment, you don't have as much worry about getting the lease.  And lastly, house-sitting is sometimes an option.  I knew one woman who didn't have a house/apartment at all once she was an established pet-sitter and lived out of a duffel bag from booking to booking, always staying at someone else's house and being paid for it.  It takes a special kind of person to do it long-term like she did, but it is possible if you take good care of the pets/houses, have great references, and reasonable prices.

It is hard moving away from a support system.  I am in the military and have done it every couple/few years for the past 14 years of my life, including one where it saved my life by moving me away from my abuser.  It is always hard to find a new social network in a new place, but you can do it.  Be friendly with your neighbors.  If I'm moving to a house, I often drop a note to each of my neighbors introducing myself (name, address, phone number, and maybe interests), so at least they know who you are and can say hi when you pass.  In an apartment, a note for a small potluck might be a way to meet the neighbors (my first post-college apartment building had a monthly potluck).  If you can buy the 99c hot dogs and buns, tell people you'll have 16 hot dogs and hope they'll bring food to share, too, suggesting chips, fruit, cookies, and such, so you can meet each other and chat.  The potluck can be posted by the mailboxes so you don't need a note for each neighbor, and you can broil the hot dogs in your apartment if there isn't a grill available.  

Beyond making a semi-social network with your physical neighbors (who may not have much in common with you), you can look for groups with similar interests.  If you like running, look for a running group (even a beginning running group if you like the idea, but aren't used to running).  If you like yoga, look for yoga-in-the-park where you can join people for free.  If you like music, look for someone to jam with.  If you like games or video games, see if you can find someone who has the same interest (maybe post a note for like-minded people in a local store that sells games you enjoy or in the local grocery store...there is often a bulletin board as you enter the store).  

With regard to the credit card, you should use it to build credit.  If it is a normal card, you'll have no additional costs if you pay it off each month.  Set up auto-payments so you never miss a payment (missing a payment results in late fees).  If you are worried about interest, use it exactly once per month and pay it off immediately.  The purchase should ""post"" within about two days and you can pay it off once it posts.  You don't have to wait for your bill if you use the online login or the app on your phone.  You can set it up with your checking account number (get a free checking account if you don't already have one) and have it paid electronically.  Building credit is important for everything from buying a car to a house.  Live within your means and build good credit.  It will save you many, many thousands of dollars over a lifetime by having low interest rates when you need them (i.e. a mortgage, a car payment) and paying in full monthly will mean you never have an interest payment.

Once you have a place to stay and start building a social network, you'll be well on your way to self-sufficiency.",1590766595,fs7jkpb,t3_gsk58q,/r/domesticviolence/comments/gsk58q/moving_to_a_new_town/fs7jkpb/,1,domesticviolence,comment

8800,kwagenknight,t2_opzwo,"Your english is pretty good actually!

In the short term you can document, secretly record and make anonymous reports to the police. From what I just read Bangladesh still has a DV problem but has enacted a ton of laws and legal rights for women which is a great start. So look up domestic violence shelters and advocates in your area that might be able to talk to your mom or atleast talk to you and give you resources to help.

In the long term over the next few years I would do everything I can to make money, while getting educated so in a few years I could help her divorce him and live with me or if I make enough set her up somewhere. Also see how willing she would be to leave him and talk to a lawyer or maybe if you have the money, talk to one yourself as they can tell you exactly what you need to do so that you can help her get out. I would also seek therapy, your situation is shitty now as you are stuck in his house but soon enough you will be able to go to university and start living your life and bettering your situation and in turn offering a lifeline to your mother.

Sorry you are going through this, you are more of a man than your father which at 16 is a sad statement against him.

8802,Gfmn2020,t2_4zomdhuy,"Can I ask you for some advice? 

I have stayed,  not for the kids,  but really because I'm stuck.  I've been a sahm for 5 years,  with 2 kids. My oldest is approaching school age.  

I deal with emotional and psychological abuse on a daily basis.  He calls me worthless, a bitch,  lazy,  really any insult you can think of he says it. At times it's physical.  

He's generally mean to me every day,  unless he needs something from me.  I do 100%of the house work and 100% of the childcare. 

Before we had kids and he was drinking a lot,  he would grab me leaving bruises, kick me, hit me, once he grabbed me by the hair and slammed my head into the car window.  After we had children it mellowed out a bit, but he still throws things at me, grabs me, pinches or pokes me, pushes me.  At times the children witness this,  but he's more sneaky about it now that they're older.  

Once he destroyed my phone because I was recording him putting his hands up to my throat saying he would kill me. He had threatened to kill me many times,  sometimes using an object like a fork or piece of scrap metal.  I deeply regret not calling the police many of these times as there is now no documentation. 

If I complain about how he treats me he tells new to ""bail"" knowing full well I have no money and can't.   

He and his mother are very wealthy,  and he has threatened that he would have the kids half time if I left.  Im very scared for kids because he had snapped at them before too as he has no patience or understanding that children are loud and unpredictable. A couple of times he had yelled at the kids and smacked their hand or something along those lines.  I fear if I'm not there to perfect m protect them it could go further.  

He told me his discipline growing up was his mother would slap the crap out of him or beat him with whatever is handy,  like a tv antennae or phone cord.  I know she would be watching them a majority of the time.  She also believes in verbal abuse such as calling someone stupid,  or more subtle insults. 

So without proper documentation (ie through police) how could I prove abuse?  I have some photos,  text messages,  some videos(not sure what all I have). I'm not even sure those are admissible.

I do have a plan to leave,  and am going to school to be a teacher, but until I finish lining up my ducks,  I'm stuck. But I'm so so scared for my kids and their future with his unchecked aggression.",1590790030,fs8w2ra,t3_grpl5t,/r/domesticviolence/comments/grpl5t/staying_for_the_kids/fs8w2ra/,1,domesticviolence,comment

8806,janey_canuck,t2_16lguu,"That's possible.  So is the possibility he's dissociating.  The OP didn't describe any on-going pattern of behaviour, and she didn't give either of us enough information to know one way or another. 

Regardless, my advice to her:
a) didn't tell her it was her job to fix his shit by tolerating it (in fact, I told her to get out, and not to marry him, 4 times, in no uncertain terms).
b) didn't tell her she was the one to provide help for him.

I gave her information to consider, to complement the other posts on here, and a possible suggestion to make to her ex should she think that would be relevant and appropriate.

I also left open the possibility (not certainty - possibility) that either or both of them could work on and change their behaviour for the better should they want to.  Individually, of course, not as a couple.  She can take active steps to address her own behaviour so as not to repeat it with other partners.  

If she doesn't, it could well be her next partner writing on here for advice about her and possibly filing charges which could ruin her life - which she obviously knows and is looking for feedback on (or she wouldn't have disclosed that).

Of course, you're right - it could be a ruse on his part, and she should be looking for indications to decide whether or not he might be a truly dangerous person, rather than someone acting out earlier trauma that went too far, in which case she should disengage completely.

If it's the latter I don't think it's at all unreasonable - if she indeed has information that he is an abuse survivor - to suggest he look into getting help for that.  It's a caring and humane thing to do, which it sounds like the OP is.  He went well over the line - hence the exhortation to leave - but they were a mutually combative couple - which is the norm in DV.  The OP sounds like she's got her wits about her and can make up her own mind.  

Most mutually combative couples don't engage in abusive behaviour unless they've been previously abused, and that last message was for the OP too - if she takes steps to heal her own abuse that will go a long way to reducing her own abusive behaviour, which will help all her future relationships (and career, etc...).

I'm not saying the following is appropriate for someone like her ex (hopefully he's her ex by now) who's jumped to this level of violence - it probably isn't.  This is information for her next relationship.  I've volunteered for years with survivors, men and women, and can't tell you how many have dated &amp;/or married partners who were also survivors, partners who were as committed to working through their own issues as they were.  Many of them were initially mutually combative and acting out their trauma at first (as the OP admitted, and another poster on here talked about) but as long as they were equally committed to healing and worked together worked on their sh*t they turned their lives around.  Which wouldn't have happened if they'd left at the first sign of problems instead of standing firm and holding the other person to account (as well as themselves).  For all of them, it was recognizing their own abusive behaviour and taking steps to correct it that finally turned things around and allowed them to enter into healthier relationships that gave their lives meaning and stability.

I can only wish that for the OP, and everyone on here, frankly.",1590794334,fs93zha,t1_fs75s7s,/r/domesticviolence/comments/gshw49/boyfriend_acted_in_a_rage_yesterday_trigger/fs93zha/,1,domesticviolence,comment

There are definitely points where red lines are crossed and people just need to get out, but that's not true for everyone, or even most.  Most couples have individual sh*t they've brought into the marriage that they need to work out, and there is very little out there to help them figure out how to do that.  And it can be ugly until they do.  It makes relationships and marriage seem hopeless, when it shouldn't be.

8810,Schnabellex,t2_5pcmrosj,"Thanks for these kind words, I really didn't expect any empathy for this story, but you really got the point in what I was trying to say. 

Abuse is never good, choking or hurting someone is never the answer. But sometimes, everyone's a victim, even the abuser. It makes a huge difference if the abuser abuses to purely hurt someone, or if he just couldn't help himself otherwise. This is something my counselor said. 

Another example/story: We went to a festival and just wanted to leave. There were thousands of people, and I was deadass drunk and saw a girl I knew. I stopped to talk to her and my husband lost me and searched for my drunken ass, afraid that something happened. After a while he found me and pulled me out (harshly), cause he was so mad that I just got lost like a small child. We walked to the car and I insulted him the whole way, calling him bad names. In the car, he couldn't stand it anymore and pressed his hand on my mouth so I would stop talking. Unfortunately it was so hard that my nose began to bleed, so I bit him and punched him in the face with my fist because I wanted to fight back. I even punched him again while he was driving. Back home,  I was afraid and wanted to drive to my brother, 40 km away. He wouldn't let me, of course, but I felt trapped and screamed for help. Fortunately, no one heart this. My point is: I was the one with blood all over my face and dress, crying and afraid, but in reality we both were victims of my drinking problem. 

It felt really good writing this out. We are different people now,  but we stayed together. 

Long story short:
People who are truly evil and want to see the other one suffer don't deserve any empathy. But I think, most of the time even the one who gets physical is not purely evil. They have struggles and never learnt to cope with pressure, and if somone offend them or hurt them psychically in a very bad way, they may snap. 

I saw myself as a victim for a long time. But after this trashy phase of our marriage I realized that he was more a victim than me. I was the evil one, laughing at him, calling him names or ignoring him completely. He just couldn't help himself otherwise and just wanted me to stop. It's really trashy, but somehow understandable in my opinion.

8818,lkattan3,t2_12v908,"Here is one way you can tell if your partner is abusive (which will only escalate as time passes, they do **not** calm down with time): when they hurt you, you are to blame. This is classic angry, controlling partner stuff. 

He pulled your hair. He toyed around with suffocating you. He smashed a door. Your fault? No. 

The longer you stay, the more you will be confused as you are now. Uncertain you don't carry *some* blame because all relationships take two to tango, right? (Had a well-intentioned friend tell me this once when I was confiding in her about how insane my ex was; she was fucking wrong) 

I'd get the book *Why Does He Do That* by Lundy Bancroft (the audio book was riveting to me). Your eyes will be forever opened. He will not deescalate ever because *you* made him mad and his response was ""justified"". That is how he feels. You'll start being more careful to not make him upset but it will not matter. 

Call the 800 number, they're just lovely people there to provide you with resources should you need them. Tell people. Tell as many as you can.

8819,Sly_Wood,t2_cguqt,"I’m 33 and moved in with my mom when I took over my business. I did it to save money originally but now that I have money I never left. It was because I slowly realized these yearly fights weren’t isolated incidents. It wasn’t about my brother or some problem that was between the two of them. It was my abusive alcoholic father who absolutely has some kind of undiagnosed mental condition. 

So I took notes. I recorded things. Both with his knowledge by stating what I was doing and without by holding my phone in front of me as he went on insane rants detailing how we were all pieces of shit and how he was going to disown me and kick me out of the house and divorce my mom because of this reason and that. He said someone was poisoning his medicine with bleach or chlorine. 

I called the behavior institutes around me. I explained everything. They asked if he ever threatened harm or did anything self inflicting. I felt bad and said no. I was certain if I told the truth he’d be put away and when push came to shove I didn’t want that to happen.

So the abuse continued. He harassed my brother at his place of business and kept harassing my mother and I who lived with him and had to listen to him go on insane rants. So I finally called the police to have him commited.

Death threats. Poisoning his own medicine to do god knows what. Harassment. It only came out when my mom actually saw the police come to get him that HE was actually fucking poisoning HER drinks! Sick fuck was spraying bleach in her tea. Pouring fuxking chlorine in her drinks!

Turns out he 100% suffers from pyschosis. We all knew he had some kind of sickness and it’s gotten worse now that he’s older. But my mom is now braver with me by her side. She opened up to me about all the abuse. Knives against her throat. How he took her to random houses in the town and held a knife at her throat and demanded to know why she was in there. That he knew she went in there. That she better answer correctly. Mother fucker was doing all this behind my back.

I swear I would give anything to have known. I really hate to think I looked the other way. That I willfully pretended things were okay. I hope I didn’t. But how could I be so blind? Mother fucker raped her. He poured cigarette ashes in her drinks for decades. He fucking choked her and threw her against the wall and accused her of fucking his brother when he was staying with us only for his brother to wrestle him and yell at him calling him a psycho for even thinking that.

All that shit. Never knew. But nothing I can do now except KEEP HIM AWAY. I will never let him be near her again. EVER. Whatever it costs.

I have a restraining order mostly due to the strength of my mother for telling the truth. We’re hoping on June 11th it will be made permanent. After that I’ll be helping her get a divorce and hopefully I can convince her to sell the house and start over.

My mom is terrified of people. She never speaks to anyone. She works for me now as a secretary and my own employees try and talk to her but she shakes because she’s always been alone and said she was okay alone. She just didn’t want trouble. It’s like training her to be human. I’m disgusted by the treatment my father gave her.

Nothing I can do about the past though. But again, I’ll do whatever I can to have my father committed again. He got out after 19 days. I’ll put him in jail. I’ll do whatever is necessarily to never let him harm my mother again.

Please I hope if you have the opportunity, don’t be like me and feel bad. Take the opportunity to save one of them. My father is iredeemable. My mother is innocent. It was an easy decision. I just wish I’d done it sooner.

First time posting here. Just thought I’d share. Google behavioral institutes and involuntary commitments in your state. Do whatever you can. Record write down and report. Anything you can will help.

I hope things get better for you.",1590811439,fs9w3z4,t3_grwd6s,/r/domesticviolence/comments/grwd6s/how_do_my_mom_and_i_escape_my_emotionally_abusive/fs9w3z4/,2,domesticviolence,comment
8820,Sly_Wood,t2_cguqt,"No experience posting on here. New to this world. Not even sure why. I was witness to it all but either I was naive or turned a blind eye....

But yea... your post reminds me of my mom trembling in front of the police and judge as she gave her statement requesting a restraining order. She shook visibly and her voice shook. The cops all looked down sorrowfully. I held my mom and rubbed her back. I wanted to hold her hands but I felt it was better for people to see them. See the truth.

There’s no way a jury will see you or my mom shake and think it’s a sign of dishonesty. My mom also worries about the pending restraining order case because my father is now out of his involuntary psychiatric hold I had him put under and we are seeking a per me baby restraining order. She worries because she never talks to people not even family. She is nervous all the time because my father threatened to kill her for 30 years. He always accused her of cheating.

He held knives to her throat. Choked and threw her to the ground. Hit her stomach through all 3 of her pregnancies and accused her of cheating every time. My mom is so completely isolated froM the world she truly believes my father could bust down the door or track her across the world. That he’s some kind of dark powerful force that can’t be stopped.

She needed my help to see that wasn’t the case. I put him in a hospital. He was confirmed to suffer from pychosis. They let him out..... after 19 days. Unbelievable but they did. They can’t hold him indefinitely u less he does something again.

So I’m there for my mom. I’m here for you. Please. Just be brave. Like I tell her...

Courage isn’t about being fearless. It’s about absolutely being afraid but acting in spite of it. Being courageous is always better than being fearless. Because it takes strength to overcome fear and being fearless doesn’t mean anything. A dumbass could be fearless because they don’t know any better.

So please. Be courageous. Show the world your strength of character. It doesn’t matter how you say it or how it comes out. The jury will see real courage when you ladies stand up for yourselves.

8831,SilverReference1,t2_58sd74r9,"Dear poster,

This is my 1st response to anyone on Reddit, so not sure if I'm doing this right but here goes.

Firstly, I really empathise with you- I would have written this myself, word for word. I know how hopeless it can be and how guilty you feel watching your siblings innocence destroyed at what should be the happiest part of childhood.

Please know that you too are a child and deserve protection, it took me 30 years to come to terms with this myself- it's your parents responsibility to protect you kids. My heart breaks for you, are you able to speak to a student counsellor at school and let them know what's happening? 

If you don't want to report directly, as I'm sure you may be afraid of retaliation are you able to send a secret signal to a trusted person to call the police as the violence is happening. Maybe a secret code via Snapchat or something and they call the cops as a ""concerned neigjbour"" that way it's not coming from you.

I know that was my main worry in reporting.

God I wish I would do more for you! Please keep me posted on how this go, I can have a talk with my friend who works in social services and see if she can recommend anything

In a small town, there are some weird loyalties. People don'y want to believe there is anything wrong with their friend. Part of an abuser's MO is to put on a perfect public image. Or perhaps there are long-standing ties that somehow are more important than facts.

In a small town, people seem to be obsessed with image, prestige and the number of friends they have. It's easy to protest something far away, but they hesitate when it comes to something closer to home. A lot of those people seem like your friends, but it seems to be a very superficial version of friendship.

Speak to the landlord. They may be willing to take him off the lease so you can force them out, or at least change the locks when he leaves and give him his stuff. 

Also call domestic violence services in your area to discuss legal options, I’m sure they have come across this issue before. Often you are allowed to break the lease early in abusive situations.

Imo the easiest thing to do would be to check the lease and see if it is ending soon, or if you can break it early for a fee. If either of those are options then explain to your landlord your ex won’t leave or pay rent or leave you alone, so you need to get a new place. He’s just squatting in your apartment. End the lease, get a new place, don’t let him follow movers or know where it is. 

He should not be harassing you while you live there. If it is possible to live at a friend’s or contact dv services about other living arrangements, you should do that. Idk if you should confront him about leaving you alone, don’t want things to escalate. Quietly leaving is much safer.

With fairly recent laws now allowing homosexual marriage and adoption, and considering the very high rates of IPV/DV/SA within the gay &amp; lesbian community, this is a growing area that badly needs to be addressed as well.  

Your advice is great in general, and for female victims of IPV with children specifically, but not so applicable for males, and I wonder how applicable it is for gay/lesbian IPV victims (for which we have very little information, it seems).  

There is a huge need out there, as evidenced by this survey of male survivors of IPV:

9328,SeattleHotBlonde,t2_411dtlcz,"Thank you for your post!

I had to call CPS over a terrible incident that I had shared with my WIC social worker (didn’t know then she was a social worker &amp; just thought she was a intake employee) who I confided in over something that is now a big picture blessing, but this was the worst moment of my entire life. 

•Trigger Warning: DV, Sexual Assault &amp; Rape:
•
•
•

She called me about an hour after I was home from my appointment, and told me she had discussed what I shared with her with her colleagues, and if I was not to report it to CPS, she was going to by the end of the day! I was pleading with her, as the acronym would NEVER be associated with myself, my family, or ever a concern for me? My son was almost 8 months old. 

The incident occurred in the same room as my son, as I have room shared per the AAP, CDC, &amp; WHO guidelines (I do safe sleep demos, training for baby carriers, a certified fitter for carriers, for both staff and events at Nordstrom... the ultimate “SanctiMommy”) and being unmarried parents who have never cohabitated together, I was raped anally by my sons father as our son had been put to bed just 20 minutes prior!

He left me in the bed, injured from what he did, as I have not been able to do that, after I was able to get out of his physical control over me. 
Over the next few days he had apologized, knew I had been bleeding, and he &amp; I both knew that if I had gone to the hospital he would be arrested, &amp; our son likely taken into custody. Luckily I seemed to be getting better and he blamed it on his having a marijuana edible previously and I had shared an embarrassing question he asked me regarding Noon to be am or pm! He was trying to apologize profusely in texts, and he said he would give me “time” which was 2 days before he was coming over again. 

He acted like NOTHING happened until 3 weeks later he got an offer for a free trip to Hawaii with an ex FWB who was in Russia (where she’s from) and she had broken up with her bf who was scheduled to go. He sent me an email at around midnight with this information, and how he’d be gone for most of the month of December! It was also our sons first holiday season. He said that he needed to be reminded that he would miss us and loved us both. 
I told his parents whom he’d been living with (oh yeah he’s a lawyer and he was 36 at the time of this: should tell ya how smart and stupid he is). They were furious and they were aware i was seeking out finishing my degree anyways and I was actually possibly going to be gone upon his return and finally end it as he only refused all previous attempts. Even though he was still going on a major vacation with another woman leaving his only child for most of his first holiday season! 

The CPS employee came to my house, and she went over my entire statement, my apartment, and she saw my active plans i was making prior to leave him. She said that she was so proud of me, I was an exemplary mother, and impressed with my strict management of my sons diet, as he has had allergy issues. After the humiliation and tears shed as she had me remove my sons clothing to check him, she said that she was closing it out as it was between two adults and our son was 7 months at the time, and asleep in his crib. Yet...she had to inform my sons father. She promised me that she wouldn’t reveal anything that could be a cause for anything to upset him and it was a shut case after he was to call her back. Yet, she did ask for copies of the apologies in texts and emails for the file. She left providing me with a lot of resources. 

Upon his return I told him that I was upset and I cried at my WIC meeting and I had mentioned his dog previously attacking our son at 6 weeks (he did and I have the pics and i called the police as soon as I could but it was too late for them to come out, he didn’t know that I called them until this last year! He was annoyed with me and he totally forgot about the entire thing! 

I had to call my WIC social worker back with the case number for proof! She said that she was not going to call ever, and she said she wanted me to see if I had the strength! I HATED her more than I have ever felt before! She had forced me into a potential situation for me to be sabotaged in my escape that she knew all about! I felt so betrayed and I refused to work with her again. 

Well I have since apologized and thanked her for that lesson. It’s been a huge big picture help for our lives, and safety. I had trauma bonded and went back to the abuse for awhile, until just after my son was 1! I knew that I had to escape! I had already been documenting everything. 

I planned to escape by our sons 2nd bday! I did the same week! It still took me almost 6 months to gain a protection order for the maximum time for parents who share a minor child. I’m going to be attending a telephonic heading tomorrow for the renewal of the order. 

I was able to get my rape reported and it’s still an open case, with the information from CPS, my WIC chart notes, verified text and email admissions, along with audio admissions. 

This CPS experience was a major factor for the success of our protection, and I have had nothing but the best experiences with CPS providing the opportunity for resources to get help! My mother is a special ed teacher and a mandatory reporter. I have had to hear horror stories before, and I think it’s something that people’s lack of accountability, and knowledge cloud their ability to understand that CPS advocates for families to be together, and they are responsible for the safety of a child/children when on call for so many assessments on their case load. 

I understand that many people will abuse the ability to report anonymously, &amp; in retaliatory actions. I have to wonder how a CPS worker is able to tell the difference, and where they draw the line in what they believe is the truth.",1590701993,fs4ttem,t3_grpl5t,/r/domesticviolence/comments/grpl5t/staying_for_the_kids/fs4ttem/,1,domesticviolence,comment

Your mom is so strong. It’s the worst guilt to haunt you as a mother. To know that you are torn between attempting to tough it out, likely due to trauma bonding, or you have to go through the shame, and continued abuse of retaliation by seeking help.
I left to save my son from seeing more than he or anyone else should ever have to see. Just a week before I blindsided my abuser who is also a local lawyer, having wrapped his arm around my neck and choked me unconscious within seconds he said, as I awoke to my toddler son grabbing my arm on one side and his dad shaking me on the other. I felt like I had been asleep for hours, but I was told that it was 30 seconds to a minute tops, and all I remember was closing the fridge and then on the floor in front of the sink. I think it was scary for him too, as he described it as “the most graceful way to go down I thought it was fake at first” and he then had decided he was going to try to attempt it again in the daytime when our son was at daycare so I could sleep as I was so foggy and confused, as he was now sexually aroused. 

I know that she had a battle inside her and she had to fight it every single moment. To admit to yourself that your child’s other parent is not ever going to be able to be trusted to be a safe person is so awful, much less admit it to others. It’s so shameful, and there’s so much work to be able to prove that it happened. We are also conditioned to not believe claims, and we are knowingly going through that, and the fight to prove it to the people to be able to keep you safe.

9348,janey_canuck,t2_16lguu,"Which part of my posts, exactly, tells you that I'm ""an idiot""?

There is a difference between ""they can’t understand where your coming from"", and 'they aren't buying what you're selling'.

The OP's post employed sophistry via dissimulation (misleading by withholding pertinent information), which may or may not have been intentional.  I called her on it, which is valid to do in forums such as this, as being harmful to certain victims.  Admittedly, I could have been more polite.  Her subsequent posts were much more balanced and fairer (although the same avoidance of important issues still was there, but less so).  

The op and I haven't become friends, but as her posts became more balanced I became more polite.  That, to me, is a successful interaction.

Considering that the op's advice as originally written could actually be dangerous to other victim groups and make things worse (which you'd have understood had you bothered to ""learn to read""), something which you either intentionally or unwittingly failed to understand, I have to question who exactly is 'the joker' here.

Sadly, I've stopped being surprised at seeing just how easily and willingly victims (and their supporters) of any particular flavour (such as yourself) will go out of their way to deny empathy, support and even agency to other victims (such as me).  

But I take it that misleading advice about DV is OK by you, as long as it helps you, and you aren't much concerned about whether or not it hurts anyone else.  Good to know.",1590709536,fs587yx,t1_fs1hiu4,/r/domesticviolence/comments/grpl5t/staying_for_the_kids/fs587yx/,1,domesticviolence,comment

9359,janey_canuck,t2_16lguu,"Well, for sure you need to get away from him.  If you have any current plans to get married, I'd recommend either cancel them or put them on hold.

Other posters are right - this won't be one time behaviour and he's not anyone who should be getting married (to anyone) in that state.

However...  his strange reaction when he was choking you makes me wonder if he is a child abuse survivor and might have been in a dissociative state (which can often look different for men than for women - violence can be more common).  That has no bearing on whether or not you should be with him - you shouldn't.  But if you care for him you could suggest he get help for that, if it's a factor. 

And you should take some steps to control your own abusive behaviour (which the pillow etc... nonsense was).  Neither of you is responsible for the other's behaviour, but both of you provoked the other which can only ever lead the interaction in a bad direction.  The good news is, if you want it, there is help out there to help either of you - separately -  communicate more effectively and civilly, and manage your anger and strong emotions - even after being provoked.",1590723230,fs5vvnb,t3_gshw49,/r/domesticviolence/comments/gshw49/boyfriend_acted_in_a_rage_yesterday_trigger/fs5vvnb/,1,domesticviolence,comment

9811,spook1982,t2_6c9gt8nv,"I have two children, a teenage girl and a younger boy who witnessed me being physically, emotionally and verbally abused by my husband. Even when the police were called 2 years ago, I didn’t press charges and eventually let him back into my home. This was for two reasons really a) I believed the bull shit lies about changing and b) I simply wasn’t strong enough. 
For the last few years, since he was arrested my life was hell. 
Fast forward to today. A few months ago he was arrested again. This time he threatened to stab and kill me in front of all our neighbours. When the police arrived, I stated again I’m not pressing charges but, it seems I didn’t have too. The statement from the neighbours, who had documented every time they heard my screams and pleads was enough evidence for them to act. I have since had all my locks changed, new locks put on the windows and a panic alarm. 
I ignored the 30/ 40/ 50 + missed calls everyday and opted for zero contact. 
I’ve since spoken to my kids and explained to my older daughter ‘if anybody ever disrespects or hurts you in a relationship, follow my lead and walk away’.  I told my young son ‘what you saw was a person who doesn’t know the difference between right and wrong, but what he did was very very wrong’ 
Walk away. Stay strong. And use the awful experience of you children witnessing abuse to educate them. And then, live you best life - independent and free from the risk of abuse and harm. Showing your children how your life has improved since leaving an abusive partner is the best way to prevent them thinking it’s ok",1590601344,fs002yl,t3_grem9w,/r/domesticviolence/comments/grem9w/horrible_situation_with_2_kids/fs002yl/,1,domesticviolence,comment

Survivors are expected to bend over backwards to facilitate their relationship even if it continues the abuse. I know, 100%, that both me and my child are better off apart from him. I will continue to fight for supervised visitation as long as possible. It is still extremely gratifying to hear from someone else that I am doing the right thing.

9828,quietplease6,t2_4vmg56d6,"It's all very complicated because law enforcement, the court, and CPS are not always on the same page. Trust me there are some horrible judges out there that will basically say the victim should suck it up to facilitate the visitation between the abuser and the children regardless of how dangerous that will be for the victim. But you see, that's just restarting the cycle. And putting osea in the victim's head that perhaps everything is safe, when it's not.

For law enforcement, there's been times when I've had to be like a hound. Once I had a problem in which law enforcement hadn't filed a protective order with the court, so they couldn't enforce it since it didn't yet legally exist. I literally had to call everyone and their supervisors to get it done and all they had to do was take a paper copy of the order to the court. The victim and I had obtained the protective order that morning and when I was trying to get it enforced, the abuser was following her from the police station to her hotel room. Yet there was nothing they could do because of that paper. So frustrating!

Just remember, regardless of what anyone says, you were the one who lived through this relationship. No one else lived through it. No one else really knows how bad it was, so no one should be allowed to try to talk you back into the same situation.

As for the you choosing someone as your partner, we all make mistakes and people are not always as they seem. To me it's more important what you learn and how you remedy a situation, rather than how you got there.

9830,quietplease6,t2_4vmg56d6,"I think there was a misunderstanding. Yes, I work for Child Protective Services. I don't choose which cases or parents I'm assigned to. Female victims (mothers) typically feel more comfortable when assigned to a female social worker. Male victims (fathers) usually feel more at ease with male social workers. Same goes with children who are victims of sexual abuse. Females will likely go to female worker, etc. That is why, when I do get cases relating to domestic violence, I am mostly assigned to work with cases in which the victim was the mother. I still have to work with both parents though. My profession does not only consist of working with children, but also working with their caregivers. And you might notice that I did not refer to anyone as a client, because our clients are both the children and the parents so it's redundant. But to make the home safe for them, we have to work with the parents.

Also, when I said staying, I refer to staying in the home with the abuser. I do not encourage anyone to leave their children with the abuser or in a bad home environment unsupervised. Victims are always encouraged to leave the home with their children or have the abuser leave the home if possible. I also jotted down the specific things I was talking about referring to ""staying for the kids"", in which I mentioned the thought of it always being best to have two parents and the thought of divorce being worse for the children. Staying in the home for the sake of protecting your children is not the only alternative.

9833,quietplease6,t2_4vmg56d6,"This is only in reference to domestic violence as we are in a forum for domestic violence. Victim refers to victims of domestic violence, in which typically there is an abusive parent and a victim parent. Children can be considered victims of emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, or neglect, not domestic violence itself.

We are assigned to all other cases randomly. The same-sex assignment is only for cases in which a parent would feel vulnerable, such as sexual abuse and domestic violence. As this would impede the investigation if they feel vulnerable with a worker. If the mother was the abuser in a case of domestic violence, then as I mentioned the case would be assigned to a male social worker to work with the male victim, unless it's a same-sex couple in which case other things are taken into account.

Thank you for your suggestion, it has been noted. At this point I will no longer reply to your comments as I feel you are just itching for a fight.

I wouldn't have had an issue if you had refrained from gender baiting, and had acknowledged that it's children, not their parents, who are your clients. You, for whatever reason, decided to bait the discussion; I, for my own reasons, decided to take the bait. Your POV is valid, as is mine (although apparently not on this forum, it seems).

I would have agreed with you, for the most part, if you'd just laid off with the gendered stuff (and, fwiw, used accurate terminology).  The term you're looking for is IPV, not DV, btw.  Children, and seniors, and the disabled, most definitely are victims of DV.

# Intimate Partner Violence

Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a serious, preventable public health problem that affects millions of Americans. The term “intimate partner violence” describes physical violence, sexual violence, stalking, or psychological harm by a current or former partner or spouse. This type of violence can occur among heterosexual or same-sex couples and does not require sexual intimacy.

9837,ItNeverRainEveryDay,t2_5u00666o,"I was unhappy in my marriage for years, and even though my husband was emotionally abusive to our children (and me, though I couldn't see it), I would just console my children after the fact and hope that my husband would get better someday. I never, ever considered divorce; I was totally opposed to the idea because I come from a divorced home.

And then my husband unloaded all his secrets on me. There were so many, but the most disturbing ones were that he was the one who mutilated my cat years ago (he blamed it on the dog, and I believed him) and that he has lustful feelings towards our children. He was also feeling suicidal, and we have a lot of guns because he's a hunter.

That night, I changed the combination to the gun safe (and lay awake in bed, fearing for our lives), and the next morning, I had him leave our home. I didn't give a crap about my determination against divorce at that point. I immediately started planning for one.

I don't know why I stayed with this sociopath for so long; it's pretty depressing that I wasted thirteen years of my life with him. But now I'm absolutely divorcing him for the sake of my children. This isn't about me at all, though I feel so, so much better without his darkness around me.

If he was an awesome father, I would have stayed despite my unhappiness in our marriage. I would have stayed for the kids then. But now I know the great risk he poses to our children. And the worst part is that he's so good at lying that he's convinced himself he never did feel that way towards the kids (but I have proof in a text). So he's buried it down, and it could come up at any time, probably the next time he's feeling stressed. This terrible person is a danger to my children, and divorcing is absolutely the best thing for them and me.

Edit: I do want to add that I did call CPS and tell them about the things he admitted to me that night. But since he was already out of the house and hadn't done any physical abuse yet (that I know of), they couldn't do anything for me. It's kind of terrible that the authorities can't get involved until *after* abuse has happened, but I suppose that makes sense. This isn't the world of Minority Report, after all.

Everything in the post and comments is per CPS regulations. Not per my thoughts and feelings.

Yes, that's exactly my point.  From my feminism class in the 1980's, told to us by a visiting professor who was a noted expert in DV (loosely quoted):

'History of policing is that law enforcement was private with mandate to 'keep the (public) peace'.  Domestic violence wasn't included in law enforcement mandates (criminal code wasn't applied in domestic situations) &amp; was rarely if ever prosecuted, with the exception of homicide.  Early feminists lobbied aggressively to get violence against women included and have assaults charged criminally.  Q: Why only violence against women?  A: Assumption was made that domestic violence against other parties would eventually be included, but to this date they haven't been.'

So now men have stepped up and are lobbying aggressively to have their domestic assaults recognized under criminal law (CPS is civil, not criminal law), and have domestic (IPV) assaults on them charged criminally.  But, to date, no-one has stepped up - or at least not adequately - to have the same effectively extended to children, seniors, or the disabled.  Particularly not assaults at the hands of women.  Hence you can, in all good faith and seeming unawareness, assert that children can't be victims of DV, meanwhile talking about supporting 'the victim' with legal representation, etc.... when caregivers aren't your mandated concern, and no thought as to why you're not doing the same for children, who are.  Children are frequently victims of domestic assault, but are rarely if ever recognized as such.

You haven't addressed the issue of impartiality and investigation, which I know is a core part of your mandate.  When you're presented with 'a victim' - child or adult - it is your job to impartially assess whether those allegations are true, and respond accordingly, either to protect the child or to send them back to their families.  I hear the all too familiar jump to 'believe all victims' with no caveats, which is what puts people in danger.

Lastly, you didn't address - at all - the disproportionate outcomes for males and females when it comes to their ability to leave an abusive situation WITH THEIR CHILDREN.  Everything you listed applies to women with children in abusive situations; very little of it is possible for men with children in abusive situations.  How many shelters take in men with children in your area?

I'm not spoiling for a fight, but I'm hoping that this will make you rethink some of the assumptions you've made, and take note of the unfairness and imbalance you've used when posting - perhaps inadvertantly, I'll concede.

I don't wish you ill; I just no longer wish to leave such biased treatment remain without pushback.",1590618307,fs0z2km,t1_fs0ovm5,/r/domesticviolence/comments/grpl5t/staying_for_the_kids/fs0z2km/,-1,domesticviolence,comment

The important part to remember is that once you become a parent, you become responsible for someone else's life. So any decision you make will affect your children.

When we become involved, the main goal will be getting the children to safety. There's two options for this:

1. Victim parent is protective and cooperative. Victim parent leaves the home with the children or has the abuser leave the home.

2. Victim parent is not protective or cooperative. Children are removed from the home and placed with relatives or foster parents.

Sometimes, CPS getting involved is just what the parents need. For the victim parent it's a choice between their significant other and the children. For the abusive parent it will be a choice between undergoing therapy/changing and their family. CPS will allow the family to live under the same roof only if the abuser undergoes all services and still a lot of supervision goes into this.

As for the allegations, for domestic violence we can do emotional abuse (for child witnessing domestic violence) and general neglect (for failing to protect the child from abuse/neglect). So both parents would be investigated as both are considered to be at fault. Being investigated does not mean you are condemned to anything, it's simply us looking into the situation.

It's very difficult to determine if the victim is just saying they'll be protective for the sake of keeping the kids or if they truly will be protective, and for this we take note of any prior history they might have.

So for those who stay in the relationship, we would be looking at a removal, services for anger management and parenting, as well as an investigation for abuse and neglect.

Again, parents are adults who can choose what they believe is best for them, but parents must take the children's best interest into account.

For children who witnessed domestic violence, they might end up repeating the cycle as adults as it is all they know. If they don't know what a healthy relationship looks like, it is difficult to replicate one. That's why it's always important to leave as soon as you can. There are some children that see the violence and they grow up knowing they don't want a repeat of that in their adult life, they spend all their adult life making sure it doesnt happen. Counseling for these children is always advised.

As for the ones that stay, some children will follow the abuser's example and begin physically and mentally abusing the victim parent. At this point, it is difficult to leave because those children will not be as willing to disclose anything that negatively affects the abuser and the children would likely ask to stay with the abuser when a custody battle is started. This, of course, leads the children who later become adults to become abusers and repeat the pattern.

Reading Why Does He Do That by Lundy Bancroft (there’s a free pdf online) and his blog posts and women’s comments on it really helped me. He also has a book called “Joyous Recovery” which I’ve read a free sample of on Amazon and want to buy.  It’s kind of a roadmap for where to start when wanting to heal from the abuse.  

I looked into a free support group at my closest DV non profit center pre-lockdown but it was still difficult to get to the meetings.  Even if you’re not LGBT, some LGBT centers have referrals for DV groups or free counseling for anyone.  

Not sure what insurance you have but in the U.S. even some state-funded insurance programs are paying for video therapy sessions during lockdown.  My cousin is doing it with her therapist and it’s free for her.  

I know it’s *so* hard to do this, but on a good day if you feel up to it, and there is anyone you ever trusted, even an old school friend or teacher you lost touch with or one you felt understood by before your relationship with your abuser began, I’ve found they are thrilled to hear from you and even a short conversation with them can make you feel more grounded after hanging up.

It covers medical and therapy costs as well as moving costs if you want to move for your safety, even if you no longer are with your abuser.",1590633017,fs1po79,t3_gr7z3o,/r/domesticviolence/comments/gr7z3o/where_to_get_emotional_support/fs1po79/,1,domesticviolence,comment

I left for my kids. They were getting older and I could see the fighting no longer affected them. It became the norm. That scared me. I have two (now three) boys, that the only thing I wish for them outside of health and happiness is for them to be gentlemen. I want them to be men that I wish I could have had in my life. And for that reason, I knew I had to leave. Their father is in a position to be a role model for them, and I didn’t want that. I didnt want to raise my boys to be anything like their father. 

I stayed for so long because of the kids, but I ended up leaving for my kids. It was the best decision I have ever made, but it was a very hard one. 

I was told by a previous social worker that in some states like California, the state will take the children away if they know that the victim isn’t doing anything about the domestic violence (such as staying in the situation).

10298,lilmizsunshine092,t2_2o0ogd3j,"My heart breaks for you. I have been in a similar situation - where I knew what the right thing to do was, but I didn’t feel ready to leave. Although having his parents on your back must be a lot of pressure in addition to everything else, but, another chance? This is his 3rd time assaulting you (and getting caught- no one is caught every time). There’s no telling what else has happened behind closed doors. 
When I left, I knew it was right, but I didn’t think I was ready. My logic outweighed my feelings, but just barely. But it was enough to get me out. If I waited until I felt “ready”, I would have died waiting. I have learned that I have to do the action (of leaving) and the feelings will follow. After I left, I felt so much uncertainty, but as I continued to do the right thing, positive feelings followed. All those things people talk about - the freedom, the happiness, etc all came for me after leaving. The clarity will come. All these things are waiting for YOU too, just on the other side of him. 
As for the communication, this is very tricky. If you have a restraining order in place, you can report him to law enforcement , however , in MY experience , law enforcement wasn’t ever very receptive to my cries for help when I would remain in contact with him. Not until I stopped responding and immediately reporting, was I taken seriously. Depending on your state, sometimes receiving a call and remaining in contact is a violation for you as well and not just him. But like I said I think it depends on the state. I’m not shaming you for answering , because I did the same thing for years and understand how challenging it is to not respond. 
This is your perfect opportunity to leave if you have the means. Since he is at a facility, I assume he is calling from a landline, and it could be blocked and he wouldn’t be able to reach out until after he got out, but if he has his cell phone that will be a little more challenging. 
I’m so sorry for what you and your daughter are going through. You and she both deserve so much more. I left about a year and a half ago, and my world has grown so much. I never would have expected to grow as much as I have. It’s amazing how much these monsters hold us back.

1.Tensions building 
2.The incident 
3. Reconciliation 
4. Calm 

And it will repeat forever as long as you stay. 

When someone physically and mentally abuses you then comes back and says they love you and promises to change.... well all we want is to feel better so we believe them. We keep chasing that good feeling because the bad is so damaging. It gets to the point we can only rely on them to make us feel better because we have lost all absolute trust in ourselves to take care of ourselves. Because why would we stay with someone that hurts us? Well that’s why... it’s because you literally rewire your brain to survive. Love is not control, jealousy, strangling, hitting you in the head etc. I say do something every single day to start building trust back in yourself,  your intuition and stick to it. Because you already know you have to leave. He’s likely going to kill you. Strangulation victims are at the very top of the list of domestic violence death.

10307,caughtbydeercam,t2_377lrnql,"1. My abuser is my (soon to be ex) boyfriend of 2 years

2. He has given me a concussion, lied, cheated, played mind games with me, isolated me from my family, plead not guilty to assaulting me, took photos of me naked while I was asleep, left me at the hospital to do drugs, lied about using drugs

3. I’m female, and I think there needs to be more awareness and acceptance for male victims.

4. I’m 25, abuse started at age 23

5. The abuse worsened my depression and anxiety. I got diagnosed with PTSD. Now I’m on antidepressants and other medications. The concussion caused damage to my brain.

6. My family cut me off since I continued to stay with him. Now that I’m leaving him on Thursday, my family is supportive.

7. Excuses he made were always about me. He was a master at turning his problems onto me and blaming me.

8. Traits of my abuser: he’s been abused himself, Mommy issues, enabling grandparent, never took responsibility, drug addict, alcoholic, in and out of jail for drug use, trust issues, jealous, bipolar depression... many traits. He also used these as an excuse for his behavior. I realized I was being abused once I took a 3 month break from him. The rose colored glasses were lifted and I realized I deserved so much more than this.

9. I’m in the United States. Punishment depends on whether it’s their first domestic violence/assault offense. If it’s their first they usually have probation and mandatory anger management/counseling.",1590515130,frw4a7t,t3_gqzmdr,/r/domesticviolence/comments/gqzmdr/if_its_okay_i_want_to_ask_some_questions_about/frw4a7t/,1,domesticviolence,comment

As far as getting custody, make sure your daughter shares her side of the abuse. Record and photograph as much of Mel's behavior as you possibly can. Chances are, she will basically tell on herself by reacting naturally to being called out on the abuse shes inflicted.

And/or comments on posts like this urging the poster to ""just reiterate your safe word next time"" and ignoring the fact that it's violent abuse and the safe word was already ignored the first time.

The National Domestic Violence Hotline has a really helpful resource written by an advocate about the differences between BDSM and domestic violence.

The resource really illustrates how domestic violence is used to terrorize and is completely non-consensual and non-negotiable.

Edit: Another user makes a really good point when they call this out as torture in addition to domestic violence.

Edit2: Dropping more resources....

Hot Peach Pages is an international directory of every country's domestic violence agency/hotline in over 110 languages.. Domestic violence advocates can assist you with safety planning, legal advocacy, emotional support, therapy and support group referrals, housing and financial assistance navigation, and more.

National Domestic Violence Hotline: Call 1-800-799-7233 or use the online chat function to reach an advocate.

Here is a COVID-19 safety plan for domestic abuse from the National Domestic Violence Hotline.

The DocuSAFE app (developed by the National Network to End Domestic Violence) may also be a helpful resource for documenting the abuse. DocuSAFE is a free app that helps survivors   collect, store, and share evidence of abuse, such as domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, online harassment, and dating violence. Survivors can document abuse by logging individual incidents, including any photos, screenshots, or video documentation of threatening messages, harassing social media posts, unwanted repeat calls, or online impersonation, among other abusive behaviors.

In addition, the myPlan app is a personalized safety planning app protected by PIN that helps you craft a safety plan to keep on your phone (if it's safe to do so).

Edit3: I forgot to mention this! OP if you seek medical care (which I strongly recommend you do), the provider can help you document injuries. I wanted to share this resource from Olga Trujillo, a childhood abuse survivor. It's a Healthcare Guide for Survivors of Domestic and Sexual Violence. Seeking medical attention can be triggering for survivors, and this guide helps you prepare beforehand.

Olga also developed a Healthcare Guide for Survivors During COVID-19.",1590566645,fryjbv2,t3_gr7z3o,/r/domesticviolence/comments/gr7z3o/where_to_get_emotional_support/fryjbv2/,1,domesticviolence,comment

10348,AuSSiETiG3R,t2_5hlrncwc,"My first question: is she her mother by blood? If she is not, then I feel she has no right, given her current state, because no matter how tall she is, she could still injure or possibly even kill her, given how angry she got.

Here's where things are going to get messy: suggestion is to get a notepad/book, write down dates/times/what was said and done, even get a voice recorder .. so that whatever she says can be captured, and possibly used against her in due time. Oh and take photos of your injuries as well .. all the more evidence that you've collected .. could only serve to build your defence against her.

My next question, is the current environment where you are now your home? Or are you in a rental situation, whereby you're on the lease .. and maybe she's not?. I'm just trying to cover all bases here, so we can understand it further. Find someone who's family or a good friend that can take care of your daughter, whilst you go to the authorities with the evidence you have gathered, sit down have a chat with them, and see what can be done, because it is clear that Mel may very well have an issue to do with alcohol. 

In the meantime, get a lawyer on your side, explain the situation to them, that she's being quite toxic, and whenever she gets intoxicated, can be rather violent, abusive, and even downright threatening to the point of trying to kill you. Get them of course to draft up a restraining order, and get it approved ASAP .. because this girl ain't gonna change her ways no matter what.

It also sounds like you have let Mel get to you so much that you are starting to doubt your own capabilities as a father, which in my eyes .. that ain't right. You were only defending yourself against her attacks, you did not hit her at any stage did you? So by her saying that you've created a bad image of men pushing women, explain to your daughter that you were only doing so on the grounds of self defence, and that under any other circumstances it is NEVER OK for a man to push or shove a woman.

10349,crosby1975,t2_etbs0zm,"Really sorry this is happening to you.  

I was in a similar boat.  I would document everything. I finally had enough and filed for divorce.  10 hours after getting served my ex wife called the police and said I was a child abuser and had abused her.  Well, The police don’t care if you say she just got served divorce papers or show text with her begging you to come home to watch the kids just two days before.  They just arrest you.  I lost custody for 7 weeks to that monster, lost all my possessions (not money) and job. 

Eventually the da had to drop the charges, the courts found out and, well, to be honest, didn’t really care other than scolding my ex wife.  I say this because if you are being abused you need to document everything as very few people will believe a man can be abused.  I am sorry to tell you this. 

Another way to do this is go to your divorce lawyer and file the police report first.  Most likely they won’t believe you but you have record

10816,Feathered_Terror,t2_6hg9v5r5,"Abuse is subtle. 

No one goes from a nice date to getting attacked.

I highly recommend Lundy Bancroft ""why does he do that"" it's available on PDF and it's free.

It's very confusing and understanding the way an abuser acts will help.

Mine would pull all kinds of psychological torture, leaving me to often wonder if I was the terrible person. He came off so respectful and caring (far better than the other men I dealt with) but it wasn't until we had a child together that he really flew off the handle.

I watched a YouTube video yesterday by Lundy and he talked about red flags to look for when dating and also how crucial it is to heal from the previous relationship before jumping into another relationship. He said the majority of woman who go on to more abusive relationships often didn't give themselves time to heal and fully acknowledge/process the abuse.

It's easy to miss the red flags that way.

It think it's easy (speaking about myself here) to believe that another person could make us happy. l realized that empty hole of being loney can only be filled by looking inward. Learning to love and respect myself gave me the courage to leave.

Being single is not the end of the world. And quiet frankly I'd rather be alone than ever live with someone who consumed my life. I'm going to focus on dating myself and taking care of myself.

10821,lck44,t2_b6m4s,"I can tell you from experience.  I have been with three abusive men, currently married to my third.  I was 18 when i got married to a man 8 years older than me.  He was by far the most psychologically, mentally and physically abusive of them all.  We have bwen divorced for 28 years, but i am still feeling the ramifications and conditioning from that marriage.  What happens is your reasoning and self worth are destroyed.  Their abuse and the gaslighting are always there in the background of whatever good things or accomplishments you achieve after the relationship is over.  You no longer feel comfortable with a partner who values your worth.  You feel like the other shoe is going to drop any minute, or they are going to discover that you arent worthy of their love and respect after all.  So you seek out what you know.  Also many people who are involved with with abusive partners are givers.  And givers seek out takers, and vice versa.  

I have an additional point on this ....being in an abusive relationship is a lot being a drug addict.  The drama associated with the mood swings of an abuser is putting you in a heightened state of insecurity and instability.  Its an addiction.

Everyone named on the account has equal access to funds, regardless of who deposited the money.""

Again, somebody correct me if I'm wrong at all. Also, as far as I know, he can't just take you off of the account without your signature. All he can do is take the money out and start a new account.

10850,morbidlymordant,t2_5ll477m9,"My first abusive relationship started at 14 years old and changed the entire trajectory of my life. I had been broken emotionally, broken physically, requiring surgery once, and at the end, was a shell of the person I was before. Looking back, it's honestly terrifying to think that a 14 year old boy could be so psychology manipulative and physically violent. That relationship normalized my view of abuse and made me the ideal target for abusive men. The following two relationships were both abusive, although not as brutal as my first.

Im 25 now and I can happily say that I have broken the cycle. I've been in a healthy relationship for 5 years now. My boyfriend met me while I was in an abusive relationship and saw that I wasn't ok. He offered to help me get out and it was the best decision I ever made. He has helped me heal in a lot of ways, although not all.

In my opinion, therapy, being receptive to others input, being aware of red flags, etc., is only on the surface. Abuse damages you to your core, and unless you really truly work on the inner issues, the person who continually starts relationships with abusive men, will still be there underneath.

Also, expanding your ""dating pool"" for the lack of a better word, may help if you haven't already tried.

A lot of us use our everyday busy lives filled with work and other activities to distract ourselves from our inner suppressed issues. 

It's important to differenciate the feelings of success and being content.",1590439062,frswxkc,t3_gqfu74,/r/domesticviolence/comments/gqfu74/why_do_so_many_women_who_after_being_abused_once/frswxkc/,1,domesticviolence,comment

It’s not about looking at the woman and trying to figure out what it is about her that might “lead her to be with an abusive man.”  It’s about seeing the reality that abusive men are hardly a minority and that they really are everywhere. 

Popular myth would like us to believe that abusive men are very small percentage. But the truth is that majority of men, if given the opportunity and if they knew they could get away with it, would rape and otherwise assault women. There was a survey done where they asked this exact question and something like 80% of the men said they would. And then the researchers rephrased the question to not include the word “rape” and something like 90% of the men said they would have sex with a woman who did not give consent to him. This is the reality for women. 

The research in Lundy Bancroft book says that women who grew up in abusive homes are not any more likely to be with male abusers. So the result is that all women are equally as likely to be abused by men. 
Abusive men are not born abusive. And women who are attracted to men, are going to want to date men.  It’s a biological drive.  The problem is that men are socialized to at best believe they are superior to women and at worst (and commonly) to believe it’s their right to abuse their romantic female partners. 

This is the polar opposite of what we are taught. 

Something I heard recently is that domestic violence isn’t a “women’s issue.”  It’s a “men’s issue.”",1590448217,frtdpqk,t3_gqfu74,/r/domesticviolence/comments/gqfu74/why_do_so_many_women_who_after_being_abused_once/frtdpqk/,1,domesticviolence,comment

 Be careful.   If he has anger issues, they won't change, only get worse over time because you continue to stay with him, the boundary for whats acceptable keeps shifting.  He will continue to lash out, and you will continue to try to justify how it's ok, that you love him, that he will change.    Why would he change if you are staying with him after the explosive tantrums? 

Remember : What you allow will only continue.    You teach people how to treat you.

Also maybe call local vets and animal shelters  to see if they'd be willing to help. But honestly, I don't mean to sound negative and I know you and your son has been through hell, but right now is time for priorities.

We left our pets behind and it sucks. Especially when he already killed our dog. 

We had to make hard choices no one should have to make, but you and your child's safety come first.

I promise you, he'll be happier and healthier in a shelter with you than living in a car with a pet. I also am absolutely believing someone out there will help you with your pet.

I am sorry you are stuck in this situation and are faced with these dilemmas - but now it's time to make the hard mom decisions and do what's best for you and your son - even if that means leaving your pet with an understanding vet.

Edit : your abuser can call around all he wants and ""check shelter's"" but will receive absolutely no information from the shelter. These people are well trained and know the games these abusers play, I don't care how well connected they are in law enforcement. Yesterday someone called the police at the shelter and they were not allowed even near our property. They couldn't even get past the gates. I know you have mentioned your abuser has connections but my dear, he isn't God and he absolutely has boundaries he cannot cross. Trust me, shelters are able to hide your car from view.

And then I went to a battered woman’s shelter! It wasn’t the most glamorous experience, but they gave me my own bed. A shower. Constant food. They gave me skills and resources that aided me in getting back on my feet and getting the help I need. These places are both secure and protected!! They don’t give the address away until you are en route to the shelter, they screen you to get in, they have gates surrounding the building, padlock entries in order to get into the gate and into the building... 

The amazing people who work in these places see all kinds of situations, they know what the warning signs look like, they’ll see the red flags in him calling to tip them off or any other controlling behaviors. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions... coming from someone who lived in Florida and actually lived within the walls of one of those places, I can definitely give you insight to my experience or even just a shoulder to lean on because this road is a hard one.

10920,cf1985,t2_2w6zp7c4,"My soon to be ex-husband (don’t worry, I left the divorce is just pending) was initially charged with domestic battery, use of a deadly weapon, and disorderly conduct, domestic abuse assessments (WI law). I didn’t want to testify because I never want to see him in person again, but was fully willing to hop on a plane and testify to avoid charges being dropped. Fortunately, he accepted a plea deal and plead guilty to the domestic battery/use of a deadly weapon charge and was given a deferred prosecution agreement on the 2nd charge. His case was somewhat difficult due to him having a psychotic break preceding the event (single instance of physical abuse). He had no criminal history prior and was sentenced to 1 year probation with a tons of stipulations—total sobriety, mandated mental health and drug evals, individual counseling, group therapy for batterer prevention, mandated to take prescribed psychiatric medication, unable to travel to the state where I reside, and no violent contact with me or anyone connected to me. He’s also federally banned from ever owning a firearm. If he violates any of these terms in the next year, he’ll do the remainder of the sentence in prison and then be charged for the deferred sentence on top of it. As much as I wanted him to be held accountable for his actions, I knew jail time wouldn’t help anything. They actually used the sentencing guidelines that i submitted to the court in my victim letter. Without adequate mental health care there’s a significant risk of him doing this to someone else. I got away and just wanted to do whatever possible to never let anyone go through what I did. It’s sad, because what was depression for years was unveiled to be schizophrenia last month. He had deeper issues going on that he hid until he couldn’t anymore. I’m happy to be free and safe, but unfortunately that continuing rests on his mental health. I’m fortunate to have access to his PO, egos great at her job.

Best of luck to you. It’s not uncommon for attorneys and offenders to bluff on having a trial until its gets closer and closer to the day. In most cases, domestic abuse cases are likely to carry a heavier sentence if they go to trial.

You need to surround yourself with positive people and try not to keep these to yourself when they happen. When you say snippets of incidences can you see faces too or are you just reliving a blind experience?  I’m wondering if you are able to rid the faces if that makes any sense. Things to remember, it’s ok that you’re not doing ok but you must try not to keep it to yourself x",1590470139,fruc7ad,t3_gqe2d5,/r/domesticviolence/comments/gqe2d5/posttrauma_sleep_struggles_and_flashbacks_looking/fruc7ad/,1,domesticviolence,comment
10929,ImYesILeffHisAss2398,t2_2egrzrvq,"You dont press charges like in the movie. All you do is file a report with the police. They investigate the report and gather evidence and then bring it to the DA. The DA then decides whether or not to take this to court. They also decide whether or not to offer a plea deal. 

So you will be making a report to the police. If these other women want to make reports to the police about their abuse that is something they will have to do themselves. As to the statute of limitations for these cases in Illinois, its normally 3 years. And yes, you need to file reports with the police because again, you dont press charges. You file reports. The police bring the case to the DA who then decides from there. And you cant normally testify in court that someone ""told"" you something that happened to them (like he assaulted them) because that is called heresay. People have to testify and I dont even know if they would be used in a case where it really doesnt belong. In other words, prior bad acts dont mean someone is guilty of this crime. They dont normally belong in court. IANAL so you can reach out to your local abuse agency for more information and assistance, but you dont need a lawyer to file a police report and you wont have a lawyer if it goes to court as you are not the defendant here.

10937,ImYesILeffHisAss2398,t2_2egrzrvq,"Reaching out to your local abuse agency can be a big help. They can refer you to a qualified mental health professional experienced in treating victims of abuse. The reason you feel guilty is something called FOG (fear, obligation and guilt) and its a tool of abusers that they condition into you, that you are responsible for their physical and emotional well being. You arent. But abuse is like addiction, the abuser the drug, with brainwashing and conditioning tactics. And right now, his family are acting like whats called ""flying monkeys"" to enable him to continue using you like an ATM to manage him and tolerate the abuse. You are the sacrificial lamb, to be abused, to take one for the team so that he can be enabled to continue to act like this. 

I would cut off contact with those enabling people who want to encourage you to deal with the abuser so they dont have to. You can also contact the court if you have a restraining order and hes calling you. You can also get a new phone number so he cant call you and dont give it to any of those people connected to him. Do whats called No Contact. Block him and anyone connected to him across the board from being able to contact you in any way by cell, text, and all social media apps. Do not trust any of those people or communicate anything to them. 

Just be gone one day. If you are married, file for emergency custody and divorce. The abuse agency can help you figure all of this out. And no, the rehab isnt going to stop him from being abusive. He doesnt deserve any more chances ever again. And his family has no business in any part of your life. So take steps to protect yourself even if it feels bad. In time, with healing and support that will stop. It will get better. Like with any drug, you have to stop using that drug for you to kick in to withdrawal and throw your shoulder into it to keep going through that to come out the other side. So reach out for help.",1590486373,frutryk,t3_gqthnb,/r/domesticviolence/comments/gqthnb/i_hope_someone_takes_the_time_to_read_this_i/frutryk/,1,domesticviolence,comment

So to an extent, I think the ""right"" person can ""help,"" but it's not real change. It's just a bandaid that helps mask a person who can't control himself when anything doesn't go his way or how he expects it to be.",1590337535,froefbt,t1_frgh4tm,/r/domesticviolence/comments/gof9i6/do_you_think_some_people_men_would_not_develop/froefbt/,1,domesticviolence,comment

I think you both need to split up for the sake of your children.

You didn’t turn him into anything. If I started a relationship with someone like yourself and you began hurting me...I’d be gone.

But he chose to stay and fight back. That isn’t normal. You say he has a criminal case for a violent offence...if he’s innocent then nothing to worry about, but it’s very unlikely he’s completely innocent in the wider circumstances is it?

You met him in a VERY fragile moment in your life, you got high and distorted the chemical balance in your brain...he made moves and bam - Love of each other’s lives?

Nah, there are billions of people on the planet, please don’t think your partnership is that special.

You are both abusive (yes you may not have been prior to the previous guy) but because of your relationship history you react to violence by fighting back.

Fair enough, you both recognise it, you both at you want to change...so do it.

Get over yourselves, you need to split up, grow up and learn to be without each other domestically.

Your feelings in not wanting to leave are completely understandable but this is a situation where you your children are being exposed to the abuse also.

They will take that in and it will cause trauma.

I understand you Love your family but it is important to make the right decisions for them.

If her physically and very likely mentally abusing you is causing you to cause physical damage to objects AND self-harm this is very serious.

I know it is really difficult to reach out to people in real life but I would highly recommend speaking to someone else.

If you have a trusted friend you can confide in that may be an option.

If not you can always see a therapist or find someone in a support group that is willing to listen.

I am worried that in the future your wife may make allegations about YOU being a Susi even and due to you breaking things she will have “evidence”

You do NOT want this to happen. I can tell you from the job that I do that men are still initially seen as suspects.

One other thing that would be really really good to do is to write a diary where you date each incident and save these (scab them so they are further time-stamped).

11804,FifiLeBean,t2_u9fjt,"HI,

I'm sorry, this sounds pretty scary.

Yes, this is serious, and it escalates, unfortunately, because what is wrong is not you or your behavior, it's what he is thinking in his head. My ex thought similarly: just say anything at all to get her to shut up. 

He never hit or shoved or hurt me physically in any way, but he thought in terms of hurting me verbally as much as he could for exactly this reason, and he did. 

The problem is in how he thinks, and there's something really wrong with someone who thinks like that. As if this is a competition or as if he has the right to shut you up, or as if your words justify his attack whether verbal or physical. 

I know you don't want to hear this, and I'm sorry, I know what it is like to hope for the best and to think maybe it's not so bad. Or maybe he can get help and get better. 

l found the book, Why Does He Do That? by Lundy Bancroft to be really helpful. At first I thought the title was not very promising, but wow, that book was such a light in the darkness for me. It helped me understand what was going on.

If your library provides Hoopla, this e-audiobook and a few others by Bancroft are on Hoopla. It also might be available as an ebook from other library apps like Overdrive. 

For what it's worth, my ex was willing to get help and even went to a support group for abusive men that was referred to him by Lundy Bancroft's website for abusive men. He did the whole song and dance about how he was going to improve and it was an incredible performance. Oscar worthy. He even went to one on one sessions weekly with a man who helps rehabilitate the worst kind of abusers, who he found through Bancroft. So everybody's fantasy, really. But it was all just a performance. 

Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde that he was, ultimately he chose to be the bad guy. 

How I realized this: I started looking at what was happening over time and realized it was only getting worse. This helped me see beyond the incredible performances from my ex and to realize that although it was a bit subtle, seeing the past year really helped to show me that yeah, it was ultimately getting worse. I got help (and still do) from local Domestic Violence organizations because unlike friends and family, they know how these abusers operate as well as what I really need (no guilt or shame or pushing) and they have been fantastic at helping me (For free) to get out of this mess.",1590252391,frk9x53,t3_gp7uvb,/r/domesticviolence/comments/gp7uvb/my_44f_partner_44m_attacked_me_during_a_verbal/frk9x53/,1,domesticviolence,comment

I started going to support group meetings and I hadn't left him. It gave me a chance to hear others' stories and also process what was currently going on, and to figure out for myself what I needed to do.

Friends and family are well-meaning, but honestly, I needed the help from professionals who understood this better than I did and better than other people did. Friends and family get frustrated and think their pat answers are helpful, and they absolutely were not helpful. As well meaning as they thought they were. 

I think the financial side is huge and most people don't know or understand it. They act like it is not important and I think it's one of the chief problems. I wish I had answers on this, but I do know that she can start finding out what to do now. 

I also recommend any books by Lundy Bancroft.",1590252781,frkamj0,t3_gp7sgo,/r/domesticviolence/comments/gp7sgo/seeking_advice_on_financial_aspects_of_leaving_an/frkamj0/,1,domesticviolence,comment
11809,FifiLeBean,t2_u9fjt,"Hmmm, I'm suspicious of his sudden improvement, to be honest with you. It's far too soon for him to truly be Gandhi, to prove any sort of real change, and nice that he's going to therapy and changing his behaviors in the short time it's been, but really, there's not a chance he is truly changed in this very small amount of time. 

What you are talking about with your feelings and the fall out of abuse: that is normal. And it's horrible but true that abusers set up this sort of thing, they lose control, and then they think how dare you actually have a normal outcome of being abused? How dare you be anxious, how dare you lash back at someone who hurt you so horribly? 

That is a normal outcome - post traumatic emotional fallout - and I experienced it with my abusive bio family as well as my abusive husband. Plus it's sadly normal to blame yourself, and we do that because we think that then we have the power to change the situation and improve it. 

If an abuser was truly reformed, they would accept the fallout as their fault and would walk through it with you completely, loving you, listening to your pain and disappointment and anxiety, and they would do what it took to heal it and make amends. They would prioritize your healing and provide for it. 

I've only met abusers who have a short fuse, who want YOU to move on and forgive them and make them feel worthy. 

I did know a man, Bob, who when I went to work for him, the first week he told me he used to be a cocaine addict and he was sober now (for decades). He told me how he abused his family by doing drugs around them, and neglected his daughters and wife and nearly lost all three of them, and somehow by the grace of God, he'd been able to recover and still keep his family, but he would never be able to repay them the damage he caused, he was determined to make them not regret choosing to be with him. He accepted 100% responsibility for the damage to his family and would hear out any anxiety, frustration, pain from any of them. For any length of time. He was also so generous with his time and listening to me as I processed the abuse from my bio family. One truly changed man. 

Bob was my example of what someone with true remorse does, and I remembered him. I watched my husband do his remorse act and get therapy, but I noticed that he accepted no responsibility, ultimately. He accepted no fallout effects to me like how I was so anxious, all I could do was play video games on my phone for hours to help me get through the stress. I did do chores around the house, but it was never enough, K just shut up about his complaints for awhile but seethed with hidden anger. He had no patience for me or the effects of the abuse, and demanded that I help him with his needs while giving me nothing. It became clearer over time, because although I wanted him to improve and I wanted us to make it, I needed time to really see what was going on with him. 

K never had real remorse, but he did a very convincing act for everyone around. Ultimately he started showing what he really thought and I realized it was not going to get better.",1590253756,frkcep2,t3_gorgpk,/r/domesticviolence/comments/gorgpk/hes_doing_better_and_im_crumbling/frkcep2/,1,domesticviolence,comment

So the best outcome is they end up with a criminal record and have to spend a lot of their time a resources going through the court system.

You should begin documenting (taking note of date, time, what the argument was about and what happened) and taking pictures of injuries because the damage to the home could easily turn against you into an accusation made by her towards you unfortunately. 

It seems like this is a very toxic situation. No one should have to live like this, especially your children because they are listening and watching and learning and I’m sure you don’t want your children to grow up treating someone else like this or being treated like this by someone else.

You are doing the right thing. I know it from what you just said: ""I can't though, not after what he did to our kids. That was the last straw."" You are right. 

\#1 let's get you some help. Can you reach out to the local domestic violence agency in your area? I know ours has a stockpile of food and they've given me food. I'd call them right now. They might also know of options to get you food as soon as possible. If this doesn't work, let me know and maybe we can figure out another way to get your family food. 

Here's a video that helped me with the heartbreak: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMnRkeUOjg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHMnRkeUOjg)

I was desperate enough to try it, and I've watched it a few times to help me. It got right to the heart of the matter for me, which was fear of unworthiness, and has made healing possible. 

If you need it, I started thinking, bargaining, ""If only I had done something different, showered more often, wore more makeup, got my nails done, done more chores, dressed better, etc"" then maybe he would have been different. I realized what I was doing eventually, so I turned the bargaining on its head: if only he had respected me, if only he had been capable of love, if only he had been capable of kindness, if only he had been capable of seeing me as an equal. It worked! 

If you have a local library, if you have a library card, they have free e-books and e-audiobooks you can get right now. If you don't have a library card, most libraries have made it really easy to get one - check their website to see what information they need and they can likely get you a library card within a couple days. Then see if they have Lundy Bancroft books available.

If there had been no activity, I knew to expect a grumpy, but sober husband. Was it right? No.  But I don't regret it because it probably saved me from a terrible abusive binge.

Originally, he had logged in i don't even know when, and yes, I did look on his activity to see what he was up to, and I did see things that hurt me terribly, but after that I used it protect myself.

He knows, as of a few days ago, he changed his password, he has never done that and he accused me of something vaguely...but hand to god, I used it so I knew where he was and if he was coming to cause trouble

&amp;#x200B;

edit to add: he probably thinks i was reading his email or something, he is not tech savvy enough to know i was seeing everything he did online in real time, it sounds so bad but I can't explain how bad he is",1590281158,frloqis,t3_gp7wze,/r/domesticviolence/comments/gp7wze/chrome_retains_your_information_on_any_device_you/frloqis/,1,domesticviolence,comment

11847,VKGOlD,t2_49rknjlp,Oh mama see that's terrible that isn't healthy and you know it's not okay because you left for everyone's safety. Your kids can't be there and your son can't go back because he needs to know that behavior isn't healthy and no one should be in that environment. It's okay to not feel okay and to be overwhelmed right now and understanding all these feelings can be a lot but accepting how you feel will help you heal much more efficiently for you. Take those deep breath and drink some water and take some more deep breaths. Do not allow yourself to break you will more than likely regret it later. There are soo many options maybe even locally to help you. He has options and choices and someone who really cares would not treat you or your family the way he does. He needs help and you and your family need help. Mama you have to take care of yourself too. Don't forget your health and well being as well. This is ultimately a safer option for you and your family. Your children will also see that what he did wasn't okay at all.,1590281939,frlq0gp,t1_frlojr9,/r/domesticviolence/comments/gpbmi4/how_do_you_not_cave_and_go_back/frlq0gp/,1,domesticviolence,comment

Unfortunately some judges feel pressure not to imprison people because the prisons are full and nobody wants to raise taxes to build and staff more.

Quote from this\^ article:

&gt; The environment necessary to create a trauma bond involves intensity, complexity, inconsistency, and **a promise**.  Victims stay because they are holding on to that elusive “promise” or hope.  There is always manipulation involved.  Victims are prey to the manipulation because they are willing to tolerate anything for the payoff, which is that elusive promise and ever present hope for fulfillment of some deeply personal need within the victim.

So going No Contact, blocking him from all contact, taking steps to use good coping mechanisms and going through withdrawal is necessary. It hurts, its painful, and we all wish it wasnt the case.

You could speak with them and they can help you take steps to leave safely.

Next, if you can get into a shelter, they can put you in touch with an advocate. Advocates are VERY important in providing you with access to programs. I have applied for programs on my own and from what I've learned, they (the shelter) has more leverage and can get the process done faster and have more access to programs that the public may not be aware of. That's the secret.

12815,realtorpozy,t2_5s4mpvva,"So this is something I hate to admit to, but before actually being in an abusive relationship, I was totally one of those ignorant assholes. My best friend married a classmate of ours who had gone into the army. Whenever he was overseas it would be all Tiffany’s jewelry, flowers and love letters in the mail but then when he was back, well you know. Then his army time ended and he became a civilian contractor overseas. He came back home a couple days after she got breast implants and ended up taking all of her pain medication and shoving her down the stairs in front of their toddler. I was furious, because my close friends are like my family and I’d do anything to protect my family. During our senior year I actually ended up starting a full on brawl at a party to keep her from getting beaten up after some girls showed up that had been threatening her for a while. Back to the husband though, he went back overseas like a week after the incident and she said she was done with him and even started seeing other guys a bit. Then her husbands contract finished up and within a day or two of him coming back she changed her number and up and moved across the country with zero warning. I was so mad at her and I didn’t understand why she stayed. She tried to contact me via her mom to explain but I didn’t want to hear it because the whole thing was very black and white in my eyes. If you get abused, cheated on or whatever else, you get out. Period. 
... Then I met a seemingly perfect man and ended up in a very, very abusive relationship. When I finally got out years later I had to write my friend an apology letter, because I finally understood why it is so damn hard to “just leave”.",1590092293,frdm3by,t3_gnowr2,/r/domesticviolence/comments/gnowr2/its_2020_can_we_stop_asking_victims_why_they/frdm3by/,2,domesticviolence,comment

I don't think you should feel guilty for 'seeming like a victim' instead of your mom because you all were victims of abuse, yours was more so emotional and less physical (even though what he did to your mom could be seen as physical intimidation towards you which is a for of physical abuse).  I haven't had therapy but I do think it's a great option that i will invest in the future. I however, had seen a councillor who wanted to have a discussion with me and my dad (this is back when I was 16 and still living with both my parents) and I could not do it, so I understand you not being able to forgive your father.

12831,a5121221a,t2_atd2z,"You can make a police report now or go to the hospital now without having to decide until later if you'll testify.   Document what has happened while evidence is available, even if it is only going to the hospital for a rape kit, but you don't need to ask the police to press charges (technically, charges are referred by the police and brought by the prosecutor, so the State would be pressing charges, not you) and you don't even need to decide if you are willing to testify against your abuser yet.  While a prosecutor can choose to press charges whether they have your cooperation or not, they often need testimony to secure a verdict, so your choice to testify or not will almost certainly affect the decision to press charges.

If you are pregnant, your decision to get an abortion or not is yours alone.  I suggest going to a clinic to get a pregnancy test and be sure.  Once you know if you are pregnant or not, you can make decisions of what you want to do.  You do not need to tell your mom that you are getting a pregnancy test.  You are not obligated to tell her if you actually are pregnant.  You are not obligated to tell her if you have an abortion.  If you feel that she will be judgmental and won't support you, you can choose what you tell her so you can protect yourself.

Continue to hold your ground and refuse to reply to your ex.  No-contact is probably the best for you (I wish I had done that...it would have made everything so much better if he couldn't continue abusing me over the phone...I was terrified every time the phone rang to the point that I'd panic when I heard that ringtone in a mall a year later on someone else's phone).

While trying to sort things out with your mom, one of the things you could say to her is that you realize you were wrong to run off with your ex, but you are leaving a very controlling environment and would really appreciate if she supports you in your decisions and doesn't try to control you.  Ask her if she would be willing to discuss why she thinks you should do things (or not) so you can understand her reasoning, but that you'd really appreciate her support for the decisions you make rather than judgment if you make a decision different than she would have made.  Ask her to help you stick to the decisions you choose (i.e. going no-contact), but to support you because it may take time before you are ready to make some decisions (i.e. whether to ask a prosecutor to press charges).  Tell her that it might take baby steps for a lot of things because you've been in a controlling situation for so long and you are still afraid and still learning that you are free of that.  Ask her to support your baby steps (i.e. perhaps going to the hospital to report the rape...the SANE nurse will probably be the person to see you (SANE=sexual assault nurse examiner) and will give you the option of talking with the police, but won't pressure you.  Perhaps that will be a small enough baby step that your mom will feel better that everything is documented, even if you aren't ready to go to the police yet.

I hope things go well for you and that you can get your mom's support as you go through this difficult time.

P.S. I'm pretty sure the SANE nurse exam is confidential until you ask for it to be shared with the police.  It was confidential in my state and you can ask about confidentiality before you tell them anything specific.",1590115890,fresmmh,t3_go9pe1,/r/domesticviolence/comments/go9pe1/feeling_forced_to_press_charges_potentially/fresmmh/,2,domesticviolence,comment

12837,lionmomnomnom,t2_6i3qtev,"Hi OP I am on a similar situation. 

My situation did take a turn for the worst (since I didn’t have proper help in the beginning and did things blindly by myself) but I don’t want to detail my situation here because I want to try to help or support your issue. 

Are you safe right now? Do you think things could escalate to physical? What you are experiencing is abuse (physical or not) and you should not have to live like this.

Getting a lawyer would be ideal. (I would have trouble affording one, but if you have the means this might be one of your best bets).

With or without a lawyer, gather evidence and store it (on your phone, notebook, computer, email, etc) I hide papers in my car since I have the only keys. I also take notes in my phone. When recording video, try to start the recording when you think the abuse will escalate. If he sees you recording while he is verbally attacking, he will likely change his demeanor.

See if there is an advocacy center and women’s help for domestic violence in your state. They will work with you (maybe accompany you to court, provide free or low cost lawyer options, assist with court paperwork, listen to you, etc). They will better be able to inform you on your approach and guide you through a restraining order or custody order. Definitely utilize free public services for this information so you have an idea of what tools you have.

You are not alone. Stay safe! You are a wonderful mom for doing the best for your child. I wish you the best and hope to see a good positive update soon! Sending you love, support, and happy vibes.

You need to sleep there anyway, so having your own bed could be a plus and they have an extra mattress for someone else later since you won’t be using their bed. Also it would be great to have your own bed since we are in a pandemic. Maybe someone from there can even help you move?

Also do you have any evidence such as police reports, videos, photos, documentation of abuse, witnesses, etc? You could apply for an order of protection (restraining order). Try to get some help with the paperwork if you can though.

The women’s abuse centers and advocate centers have turned you away? Did they provide another resource for you to get in touch with an advocate? A local victims advocate would be able to provide info and lots of resources and guidance of there is one in your area.

12852,xfallenxnightx,t2_2rmehyde,"I think there's a misconception that seeking therapy or an advocate is going to help someone feel better immediately. That's not the case, therapy (especially when you've been traumatized) is hard and it's painful. While it does benefit people after, therapy isn't gun. Most of the time, it hurts to explore those pieces of your brain. From my experience both as a survivor and as a victim advocate, some of those painful trauma symptoms take time. It's not surprising that these feelings are coming up if you're going through court, having to relive all you've survived is painful and re-opens the wound, if it was at all healed to begin with. 

It took me years to feel safe after my 5 year abusive relationship ended, and sometimes I still feel unsafe. But, I've become more comfortable than I had been. Unfortunately, healing takes time and patience. Still do all the things your doing, taking care of yourself through therapy and the like. One day, this won't hurt so much. One day it won't feel like you're reliving every piece in graphic detail. You are so strong to push through this, even though it hurts.

But violence isn't a joke and you're right to worry about it escalating. You need to do your best to take pictures, save texts, anything that proves the abuse is taking place. If there are no consequences to his violence, he has no reason to hold back.

13333,Reallysillystupid,t2_6ggj2ahc,"There is a book written by Adam jukes titled men who batter. The book is expensive so I rented it from Kindle Amazon. 

Adam Jukes counseled abusive men for 30 years. he said men abuse because they want to be in charge. It's for domination. It's to gain power and control. It's not about being angry or losing their temper like they claim.

 He said it is impossible for a man to overcome his abuse if he blames other people. If they blame their emotions such as anger, if they blame alcohol, if they blame their mother and his abusive childhood, no matter what they do-- if they blame something else they never change. 

The only way they can change is if they feel sorry and depressed for what they done. And understand and acknowledge that they are trying to be dominant. And they have to stop making excuses.

And I also read a book called Men who hate women and the women who love them. She said that typically most abusers always blame their victim and never feels sorry. At least most of the abusers that she has counseled.

And it's really shocking that they don't feel sorry and they blame the victim because most of the time they beat her over the most petty thing imaginable. There is something seriously wrong in their head if they think that's normal to be a woman for 4 hours just because she said I'd be coming to bed in a moment and took her time.

Tell your in-laws there's no excuse for abuse. And no one deserves to be hit for any reason. Tell her to read the book Why does he do that? This book is the easiest to read. According to this book which was written by another therapist who counseled abusers for many years, the reason for abuse is that they want power and control. They aren't losing their cool because of their emotions but anger is the tool.

 Anger is part of the abuse as a way to control people and intimidate people. They are not beating you because they are angry they are beating you because they want control you and they're using anger as a form of control. Anger is part of the abuse not the cause of the abuse. 

 All the books were interesting but the book Why does he do that? Is the easiest to read and may be the most helpful. Your in-law seems very ignorant about abuse and you need to let her know that she's ridiculous.

Tell her she's very biased and shouldn't talk about what's going on because who can believe her she's the mother? Most of the abusers are actually very charming and people have trouble of believing that they're abusive. There's even been a book about it. I don't remember the name but something something charming. Someone who opened up a domestic abuse shelter in the United kingdom noticed that a lot of the women said that their partner was very charming and no one would have guessed that they were abusive.",1590011152,fra65av,t3_gnjfjo,/r/domesticviolence/comments/gnjfjo/mil_and_domestic_violence/fra65av/,5,domesticviolence,comment

You are getting too wrapped up in her attempt to create a new narrative. But the difference between her version and your version only matters if you believe that instigating is a fair justification for abuse. And it just isn't. So it doesn't matter at all what she thinks.

I highly recommend you look up “gray rocking”. Don’t feed into your MIL, the more of a reaction you give her, the more she will continue. From now on, tell her she can communicate with you about her grandkids, but other than that their is no need to.

He outlines the only way a man can heal and change.  Adam Jukes has a little bit of a negative view of men though. He also wrote a book called Why men hate women?

DO NOT drop the restraining order, keep it. If she helps with the kids find someone else because she will probably always side with him to the point of making you look back for the court system. I would stop talking to her and avoid her at all cost, if she is on any kids pick up lists at school or daycare drop her.

It is not easy leaving a relationship and doing this on your own with kids but it is doable. I personally was scared to death when I divorced my sons dad in 2012.

My ex's mom is the same way. She enables his alcoholism and they hardly intervened when he was hitting me. His sister basically made the comment one night, if you weren't pregnant then I wouldn't have gotten involved. Like another words normally I think you can hold your own but since you're pregnant I got in the middle of it. 

I'm no longer pregnant but at the time I was about seven or eight months pregnant. So in other words, they wouldn't have intervened if I wasn't pregnant even though they know it's wrong. Even his sister said he can be an asshole. That's an understatement. also, my ex is Mom said his dad abused her but she Said that the first time that he tried to hit her, she picked up the ceramic flower pot thing and threw it at his shoulder in dislocated it and that's the last time you tried it.

 She basically told me to just sit there and take it and let him run out of steam which I was horrified by. Fuck these kind of people, they have no clue what we've gone through unless they've been through it themselves. And fuck Mothers like this who think their sons can do no wrong no matter what they do. That's just bad parenting and it is partly their fault that their sons ended up that way because the way you raise your child shapes the person they become so it's very important to teach them healthy coping skills and teach them to be healthy productive adults who don't batter their Partners.

 If your child grows up to be a better than it is your own fault because you taught them to be that way Through their upbringing. They have no right to blame it on their child's partners. They just don't want to take responsibility for where they fucked up. It's easier to blame someone else. Sorry, I kind of went off on a tangent there LOL.

13371,ShredderRedder,t2_450blliv,"People also don’t realise how hard it is when kids are involved, and the prospect of facing family court judges that a) may not believe you b) regularly grant access to sexually offending parents c) might believe you and even then you face either greedy or insufficient or ineffectual legal help. 

These are the same people that tell you to run with the kids - where? And then get caught when you least expecting and end up losing kids full time? Or end up being hunted like an animal if they don’t get visitation? 

I don’t know what to do and I’m glad I atleast live away in a safe, warm, clean and sober home. We have fruit and vegetables, cheese, juice. I have multivitamins and can go exercise.

It took awhile and a lot of planning and a lot of luck. I got love bombed so hard and the worst was when you aren’t used to attention and affection, you get sucked in bad. I wish I was stronger and smarter back then but I just wasn’t and it’s nothing to be ashamed of. 

If it was easy enough to have just left, I definitely would have. It took a number of attempts, including removing myself from things like rentals, utilities and trying to find work and a safe place while homeless and drug affected and all screwed up wasn’t an easy feat. It was pretty much only by sheer luck that I got out. And thing is, refuges might be full. You might not meet a high enough risk criteria for intensive assistance. It’s a range of things that could go wrong.

13808,peach-treez,t2_2hugv7ys,"Before I converted to Buddhism, I was a Baptist. There was this analogy they always used with sin but I want to give this analogy to you right now as it might be useful. When you have a baby in your sights, they are bound to get into something dangerous. It’s our job to stray them away from these dangers. Say a baby saw some rat poison. Rat poison is a pretty color and looks edible, especially to a baby thinking on instinct, the baby goes to eat the poison. Do you: 1. Take the poison away from the baby, despite how angry and upset he gets? Or do you 2. Keep the baby happy and give him the rat poison. 

Jon is your rat poison, you are the baby. He might look like a refreshing bite, but what your mom is doing is protecting you from the potential bigger danger that lies ahead. It is statistically true that once your partner lays their hands on your throat, they are 100% going to kill you. He might look good now,  but most abusers who choke do not go back. They do not realize they are going to kill you either. 

Another thing, at 15, i was in a relationship very similar to what you describe. Of course, I didn’t have control over where my mom decided to go but we never left. I just had my phone taken and wasn’t allowed out. I was lucky because he ended up nearly killing the girl he was dating after me. Your mom is looking out for you. 

Listen to her. She’s on the outside looking in, with an unbiased opinion. You are young, and there are far better men out there who will not put their hands on you. It doesn’t matter what he was going through, if someone truly respected and loved you, they would know better than to put hands on you to prove a point. It doesn’t matter that his friend committed suicide or that Jon was angry, that does not give him the right to choke or hit you. Get out. Now. You have the option to.

13814,DV_throwaway19675,t2_6drzimqo,"My ex husband was just like that. I used to have a lot of empathy for him and his traumatic childhood, but one thing that I had going for me was that I, too, have a traumatic childhood and dispite all that I manage to live my life without calling others horrible names, without threatening violence, or committing assault or damaging other people's property. It was very obvious to me that his constant trotting out of his childhood trauma after his meltdowns was an attempt to prey on my empathy and also a reflection of his unwillingness to take responsibility for his own actions. 

It was a relief when I got a restrainig order against him and was able to boot him out of our shared home. I talked to my therapist about how I was living with a constant sense of low key guilt all the time. I realized that that feeling of guilt was the conginitve dissonance of having to live under his layers and layers of untruths that he concocted to shield himself from the reality of his vile behavior. For example, when someone asks you how you are you dont say, 'well my husband constantly berates me and treats me like a garbage dump for his disgusting sense of entitlement.' You say, 'I'm fine,' and then the guilt sets in. Everytime you wake up to another day and act like nothing is wrong so that he won't go on yet another rampage creates a sense of unreality and more guilt. The guilt is the sense that you're betraying yourself, becuase you are betraying yourself every moment you choose to stay close to a person like that. 

Now I only deal with him through lawyers until our divorce is settled and the layers of his bullshit get stripped away throgh the legal process. It's something to go back and read his accounts of what happened via police reports and his own testimony, neither of which corroborate. 

Maybe he is so fractured and damaged, but you can't spend your life trying to put him back together. All you can do is step away and, if there were justice in the world he'd have to face his demons and get on with life knowing that he royally fucked up, but the reality is that he'll probaly just move on to his next victim and the cycle will repeat.",1589920272,fr65iel,t3_glifhj,/r/domesticviolence/comments/glifhj/what_now/fr65iel/,1,domesticviolence,comment

I guess their rationale is that if they can get you to hit first it's automatically all your fault, and they can make all sorts of ridiculous claims about self defense, but be assured they were planning on beating you the whole time.

13830,a5121221a,t2_atd2z,"Like the other posts said, there are resources and a local domestic violence organization might be able to help you make a long-term plan.  Getting out is the most important thing.  If you can bring important papers with you, do it (i.e. marriage certificate, birth certificates, passport, will).  It will be much harder to get things after you left than if you can bring them with you as you walk out the door.  

Once you are safe and told the police, go to the bank and make sure your husband does not have access to your accounts.  If you have joint accounts, open a new account (preferably at a new bank), then withdraw what you believe is fair (that may be important in the divorce proceedings, so keep good records) and transfer it to your new account that he has no access to.  Make sure you name a POD (payable upon death) of someone other than your husband so that money doesn't go to him if anything happens to you.  Longer term, you should also have a will drawn up now that you are separate from him and specify who should raise your son if anything happens to you.  

Near term, file for a protective order.  It may or may not be granted, but if you file now and it isn't granted, there is a possibility that it will be granted in the future if you reapply after your abuser does something else that may warrant protection, even if you didn't have sufficient evidence to get one yet.  

I'm sure there are lots of things I'm not thinking of, but hopefully your local DV agency has checklists and specific resources that can help you.  

When you go to your mom's place, there is no reason to notify your husband where you are.  Make sure there isn't any sort of tracer on your phone (i.e. Find my Phone) and if you aren't sure, keep your phone off unless you are calling out.  When he contacts you and if he asks where you are, have a plan of what you'll say.  If you have a hard time telling any fibs, prepare something that is true, but ambiguous.  For example, ""I was at McDonalds, but I'm not there any more.  I'm going someplace safe.  I don't want you to know which hotel I went to.""  If you can't say that when you aren't actually staying at a hotel, go to a hotel lobby for a little while, just long enough that if you feel that it isn't a lie to say that you ""went to a hotel"".  Keep anything you say to him ambiguous enough that hopefully he won't go to your mom's house looking for you.  ""Yes, my mom is helping me, but bothering her won't help you find me.""  If you have a car, it may be necessary to park it a block over on the next street or even trade it for another car (I sold my car when I was being stalked and got a different car so I would be harder to find).  

Get out safely and start the rest of your life.  You deserve to be safe!",1589940928,fr772yj,t3_gmzojm,/r/domesticviolence/comments/gmzojm/advice_wanted/fr772yj/,2,domesticviolence,comment

I also suggest changing passwords to things like your email accounts, bank accounts, social media, etc. I stored a lot of my documentation in Google drive and email, and he hacked in and deleted things. I ended up setting up a new email account he didn't know about to protect against future hacking attempts, too. Things like turning off gps on your phone are helpful. Watch for social media or other apps that might disclose your location as well. And, you might think about if you *really* need to answer the phone if he calls.

14298,OnlyLeading3,t2_6i6ytb09,"Hi Jenna,

Since I am working on a program, I wanted to know how to help you or anyone else in a similar situation so I contacted [icadvinc.org](https://icadvinc.org) in Indiana and this is their response. I spoke on behalf of your situation, no name was given.

Sadly, during COVID 19 none of our shelters are taking new clients from out of state or even from other parts of the state to avoid possible spread. They have also reduced their bed space capacity to allow for isolation when necessary if clients are symptomatic. This will likely continue through the end of July. If she comes to Indiana she will likely be referred to homeless shelters which are also practicing reduced services. It is highly doubtful she will be able to find a place to live easily. 

She could access non-residential services to assist with applying for food stamps, etc. Most of those services are only being provided virtually (Zoom, Jitsi) although some in-person contacts may be scheduled. Many of our state offices like food stamps are not open to in-person either. Our non-residential services will not be able to provide her an address.

All of the above is true for most states nationwide. I would caution her to plan and call ahead. Her best option for safety is to try to find shelter in the state you are in and have one of the advocates in that program assist her with relocation. I wish I had better news for you. Unfortunately, COVID 19 has impacted residential services very quickly.

I hope this information is helpful for you or anyone else who is in a similar situation.",1589818898,fr1fnln,t3_glhm2u,/r/domesticviolence/comments/glhm2u/preparing_to_start_over_after_leaving_my/fr1fnln/,2,domesticviolence,comment

14306,ELfit4life,t2_hi005v4,"I’m so sorry to hear that your case was dismissed against him, but have hope and keep pushing the issue. Giving up until you’ve succeeded or (hopefully not) reached the end of the road with attempts and no success signals to you abuser AND the police that you probably weren’t telling the truth, embellished to make it seem worse than reality, or are even *accepting* of your abuse... please, don’t give up! 

Unfortunately, I, too, didn’t get justice for my DV. In fact, I’ve had: 

1. detectives not-return contacts (call/email) out of sheer disregard or disbelief of me (some next reasons are why). This showed me they didn’t care or believed my ex’s lies of me waiting to come forward so long so I could doctor/fake evidence and gather false witnesses (a lesson: don’t ever hesitate to file a report and do it every time). 

2. multiple false reports against me (stealing his car, coming at him with knives, putting him through the wall) made by my ex (during/after relationship) in attempts to have me arrested or committed... I’ve proven his lies (still not charged with false reporting, ever), but I still have a thick “case” file on me documenting that I, not he, was the abuser (thankfully got that tossed out), “aggressive,” “mentally unstable,” “bipolar,” “constantly suicidal,” and had “attacked or threatened to attack [him] on multiple occasions”. Ironically, he was the one constantly exhibiting those behaviors AND on several altercations encouraged me to commit suicide by shoving at  me knives/tools/substances to do so... needless to say with this one, the cops (after 17 visits in 3 short months) don’t believe me or judge me to be something I’m not. 

3. only one pair of cops from the 17 visits ask/encourage me to press charges (which were dropped), and then the older one basically told me I was dumb and had no chance of winning in court because I didn’t report every time... this was the day my ex discarded me after dragging my by my hair out of his car as I was collecting my things from it, elbowed/hit/shoved me down, and would have run over (and severely injured or killed) me had I not reacted quickly getting up of the ground. Charges of assault again were never filed or even followed up on... and the whole thing was caught on our security camera! 

4. been arrested and charged myself with DWI/felony drug possession (he planted the drugs in my car) the *one* time I stood up for myself and called the cops after being hit in the face will barreling down a highway and booting him from the car. This one really sucked because I spent the night in jail, am still having issues being hired because of the arrest almost a year later (even with NO conviction...), and could be convicted of a felony (that will ruin my life and already ruined my teaching career) that was literally just another way he abused me. And even though I told the cops I was assaulted, no charges were filed because I was “drunk, hysterical, and *obviously* self-medicating”; sadly, the cop apparently wrote I was drunk, high, and on anti-depressants that were found in my purse (and I was NONE of the above) when in reality I exhibited “symptoms” of those things due to the red mark on my face where I was hit, puffy and watery-eyes from crying hysterically over what happened, and was forced to remove my glasses and walk in oversized shoes for my sobriety test. On top of that, he stated as FACT the things he claimed in my arrest report (which isn’t legal of them to report anything but facts and conclusions drawn from those). This is the same cop who assaulted me by body-slamming me (along with 3 others because I was “resisting” by saying I didn’t want my blood drawn until I spoke to my lawyer and new my rights), refused me a phone call for 6.5 hours after being brought in (also illegal), committed fraud/perjury by signing off I read/was read the paperwork and understood it when (again) I refused anything until a phone call, and name-called/threatened me with implied sexual assault (stuck his fingers in my mouth and told me I needed to “shut up crying or get something else a coke whore might enjoy shoved in my mouth” to get me quiet), AND who’s body cam mysteriously had “technical difficulties” that night (so no footage to prove any of my side). **Side note**: “Coke whore” was something my ex called me constantly (that was said to police and also placed in my arrest report), even though he introduced/forced me to use with him and his friends until I became addicted (which I’ve overcome since then, thankfully). 

5. to spend $2500-3000 on *three* separate lawyers to attempt and fight several court battles, both criminal and civil, against my ex (and lost them all so far). 

6. a protective order granted *against me* that nearly forced me to be labeled on public record the abuser/ordered to take a batterer’s counseling program, but I “settled” on just the protective order—even with mountains of evidence I had proving his abuse and only 2 texts from me to him speaking of legally ruining his life (so threatening, right...?) once I was free. This PO cost me my firearms and CHL rights, any communication with the ex/his family/other house residents (even though we have a legally binding buyout agreement for MY home I bought for us that he has violated multiple times to cause me financial ruin while refusing to pay me the sad amount of not even half my investment I’m owed in exchange for the property—my *only* source of income right now). 

7. my BDSM involvement/practice used against me to claim I “wanted, asked for, and *even enjoyed*” the abuse I received, “if in fact there *was* abuse”... this one angered me deeply because it’s a) none of their business what I do behind closed doors in my sexual life, and b) something I practice that has actually helped me heal parts of my abuse over time (especially the physical/sexual assault I endured).

8. a judge actually *laugh me out of court* saying “how could a big gal like [me] (6’5”) be abused by someone so much smaller (ex is 5’7”),” I had the means and size to defend myself and chose not to, and a history of “documented” aggression and severe mental illness, suicidal “attention-seeking” tendencies, and addiction issues... that all meant there was *no way* I was being abused (and in fact accused of being the abuser—again). 

I suffer from severe depression (began in teen years and worsened) and now anxiety (also from teen years) that has been re-diagnosed from a “general” disorder to full-blown panic disorder, insomnia, and PTSD, all while still at risk for relapse and a return to addiction... Failed justice and the shame/embarrassment from the things I’ve been through to try and achieve it only add to my deteriorating mental health. I’ve lost faith in the justice system, unfortunately, for all of these reasons... 

I hope that you don’t befall the same failed justice I have or grow disenchantment/disgust towards the system itself. You deserve justice, and my heart and soul plead and beg and will that you have it! 

Please, if you ever feel the need, reach out anytime for any reason. 💜 Stay safe, and I pray that you find a way out of your abuse soon. Good luck, and know that you are a strong survivor and will find a way to freedom.",1589826420,fr1v0vo,t3_glxzyv,/r/domesticviolence/comments/glxzyv/domestic_violence_case_thrown_out/fr1v0vo/,1,domesticviolence,comment

14314,Stranded90,t2_55pcalev,"I've had a similar experience but it was over long distance relationship online. It started off the same way as making inappropriate jokes of my past or me in general and he would turn it around as im the sensitive jerk while he got mad walking away in a huff. I was raised in a dv household and went through a life changing trauma that he would ""joke"" about. He would also slowly condition me to just naturally call him first thing in the morning and then would threaten not to skype me because i took to long. Your boyfriend is conditioning you to show up anytime he calls for you even if its for nothing, to do everything for him for fear of the consequences, and his seeing what he can get away with by breaking your boundaries. This is a start to an abusive relationship, because once he has you ""hooked"" its hard to get away even if you live miles apart. I recommend going to https://www.loveisrespect.org/healthy-relationships/communicate-better/

This website has saved me from myself, because my ex was pushing for me and my child to move in with him states away from my friends and family. I thought the behavior was normal do to my background. Its also helped me establish control again because i now have a clear understanding of how to set boundaries, what isnt unacceptable behaviors in a relationship, and how i can effectively communicate with not only future partners but in any situation.

Please dont hesitate to also talk with close family or friends about the situation and make them aware of why you moved out in the first place. This will help prevent him from gaining even more control by using false narratives and potentially escalating his behavior when he doesnt get his own way. Remember mutual respect, understanding, and open communication is a basic right in a relationship its not a priviledge that can be given/taken anytime as punishment.

I hope it goes well with what you decide to do and really look over that website so you have a better understanding of what to look for if you plan on talking it over.",1589836841,fr2gezg,t3_gln4iy,/r/domesticviolence/comments/gln4iy/my_boyfriend_24m_raises_his_hand_at_me_21f_as_a/fr2gezg/,1,domesticviolence,comment

14316,spook1982,t2_6c9gt8nv,"I attended couples therapy in the UK with my husband.. he worked on his anger and stabbed me. 
Seven months we was apart awaiting a court date with a restraining order in place... obviously he contacted me. By the time the court date arrived I believed him when he said he has been in individual therapy and ‘approached his abusive tendencies’ 
I accepted him back into my home. For three months it was lovely... for the past two years, absolute hell. 
He was arrested again weeks ago during lockdown. I didn’t even need to give a statement because my neighbours statement was damning enough. They heard him call me names, hit me, push me down the stairs, heard me begging for my life.

14333,ELfit4life,t2_hi005v4,"First, I'm so sorry to hear you have had to endure any abuse, but I'm glad you've had no issues in regards to the cops. 

I don't have children with my nex, but mine was the SAME (live in Texas also).

He repeatedly called the cops and filed false reports on me (17 times) for ridiculous things (stole his car, came at him with a whole knife block, put him through a wall--ironically, he actually was the one who did the last two to me). I now have public record labeling me as ""mentally insane,"" aggressive, having ""attention-seeking"" suicidal tendencies, riddled with multiple addictions, ""bipolar,"" the ""probable abuser"" in our situation due to my size (6'5"" F), and even that I would purposefully come forward a while after it was over to report the DV because I would need time to ""fabricate and doctor evidence to falsely accuse"" and find ""fake witnesses who would collaborate with \[me\] that were 'just as insane as \[I\] was""...

I do admit to having a plethora of mental illness (worsening pre-existing depression, panic disorder, insomnia, and PTSD now), most of which is a result of my abuse, and I also was an addict/alcoholic that used and drank to cope (even though he introduced me to harder drugs, forced me to use with him or get abused, and allowed our roommate--because I hadn't ""earned the right to live with \[him\] alone given what a psycho cunt"" I was--to use and OFFER me drugs while I battled my addiction, blaming me of course for not having enough discipline to say ""no""... or ""lose weight, be emotionally intelligent, not a fucking psycho, or even kill myself like \[I\] should because \[I was\] worthless.""

And, to top it all off, he got ME arrested with a felony drug charge by planting drugs in my car because he was pissed off I stood up to him for once after being hit while driving down the driveway (over him verbally abusing me/being aggressively distracting with the radio/console/grabbing the steering wheel). He also won a protective order against ME because he claimed I was harassing, stalking, and trying to kill him--all lies, again--that cost me a lot. I can't even go within 200 yards of the home that I bought with MY money (he has others believing otherwise, the fucking gaslighting narcissist) and was almost labeled as an abuser by the court (and would've been forced to take a batterer's counseling program). Thankfully, I had a good enough lawyer (who didn't even look at my evidence I gave or push the issue that I proved he was COMPLETELY lying, under OATH, on a SWORN AFFIDAVIT) to ""settle"" for 2 YEARS of (under threat of being forcibly removed by a sheriff) the loss of my house or right to live in it, losing my guns and CHL, inability to leave the state (also a condition of my bond), and no-contact to his roommates, family, or him. To this day he is still abusing me, financially, by refusing to honor the buyout agreement I was forced into for the house that ordered him to pay back a laughable part of the amount I invested into what was supposed to be my home and refinance any and all loans out of my name immediately (except the house) or make the payments until paid off... which he has done neither on multiple occasions and has now ceased any payment to me for 2 months this far... and those payments are my ONLY source of income I have right now since I didn't qualify for unemployment because I couldn't prove that my hostile work environment (as a result of absenteeism because of my abuse) was forcing me to quit to save my health (and I had my PCP and addiction counselor suggest I leave, but the rep I spoke to said they had to ""order me to leave"" to count... like, what the actual fuck?!).

Best advice? \*\*Listen to your lawyer.\*\*

\*The cops \*\*cannot, without evidence-based suspicion of criminal activity or active harm to someone,\*\* bust down your door and come after you--at least, not legally. In my experience, that doesn't mean they won't illegally do something to get at you. 

If your ex has your children, report a parental kidnapping immediately and make sure to bring up the custody order. 

If you are the one who has them, then make sure to report to the cops what's happening \*before your ex gets to them\*. They are required to at least write up a report of anything involving someone's welfare, court-ordered items, and the like. And it shouldn't lead to any trouble for you (although make a point of bringing up your lawyers orders and any current court dealings on the issue), since custody is a civil issue unless harm is believed to be done to the children AND the fact your ex was abusive. Especially with him refusing to tell you his residence, you need documentation (the police report) to prove you are honoring the custody order to the best of your ability... I'd even go so far as to say that you fear for the children's safety if they were to be in his care (if that's the case).

I made the mistake of not reporting things I thought weren't necessary... and I got burned... badly. Don't make the same mistake I did. Worse comes to worse, you will ""waste"" the cops time if they say that they can't/don't handle things of that nature.",1589851641,fr37qa3,t3_gmd1fl,/r/domesticviolence/comments/gmd1fl/police_and_custody/fr37qa3/,2,domesticviolence,comment

14349,nonymouslynoname,t2_6i3t2nb2,"Thank you for your reply and I'm sorry you went through a similar experience. I'm glad that you figured everything out prior to moving away from everyone you know. 

I looked at the link.. I have tried to use most of these communication tactics during this relationship. I feel he does not listen to me when I bring up my concerns. Which I'm used to because of the way I was raised and such. 

Under the ""how to communicate if your angry"" section it says to go on a walk.. the few times I did this he asked me question before I left or after I returned. When I go for a walk when i am angry and he know I am heading out I usually offer to grab him tim hortons to which he accuses me of going to see other people. Or when I left without him knowing I did so, upon my return he asked where I went, what I did, why? But not in the way that he is wondering in a caring way it's always harsh spoken. No yelling. He also makes a fact to state "" I thought you were out getting drunk and I was going to find you in a ditch."" I left my wallet in plain view on the shelf right beside the door. He stormed off and locked himself in a room prior to me leaving.. 

Most of my friends know but none of my family  members do. They know I moved in with him a year ago and I am now moving out. The problem with my family is they throughly enjoy gossip and telling everyone about everything so I haven't told any of them yet.. Although my friends that know about this situation want me to leave him as soon as I can... I dont know if i can because I'm very comfortable with him. I have a ton of self image issues, hes never pointed anything out about my body but I have bad anxiety due to events that occurred in my childhood.

Just the other day, he told me (straight, supporter) not to drink because he was jealous of my female roommate who is also straight. He constantly asks if there is that he needs to worry about with her and I, or any of my other roommates for that fact.

14352,NJTroy,t2_xzw53v7,"Yes it sounds like escalating abuse. Yes, he’ll do it again. 

Unfortunately the statistics on recovery are very poor. My understanding is that less than 10% of abusers will change. To change, the abuser needs to take full responsibility for their actions. Not “I did it because you...,” not “I was stressed,” not “I was drunk,” full and complete responsibility. Then they have to make a long term commitment to change including therapy. 

I recommend you read Lundy Bancroft’s “Why Does He Do That?”  It’s considered one of the best books on this subject and has been made available online for free. That will give you a better understanding of what you are dealing with here. 

And given that you have started your go bag and plan, make sure you take your important documents. Birth certificates for you and the kids, social security cards, copies of all insurance cards, passports if you have them, registration and title for your car, insurance information and so on.

14797,coy__fish,t2_222dpyjt,"[Here are some signs that an abuser is committed to changing.](https://www.escapeabuse.com/?p=110). It can happen, but it is rare. I've known some people who overcame emotionally abusive tendencies, but I don't know of anyone who stopped physically abusing.

It worries me that you seem to be taking some of the blame here. You say ""*we're* not recovered"", but I don't read your behavior as abusive here. Sure, you could have communicated more effectively, but poor communication doesn't cause or justify abuse. 

It's good that you want to work on being better, but **his recovery isn't tied to yours**. A recovered abuser understands that it is never okay to use violence or physical force in a relationship, no matter how inappropriate the other person's behavior might be. Even if he's especially angry, even if he feels provoked, **he is responsible for handling that feeling in a nonviolent way**.

Here are some possible red flags I'd like you to keep an eye out for. It could be a sign that he isn't addressing the thought patterns at the root of his abusive behavior if:

 * He refuses to discuss grabbing and hitting you, and/or asks you not to bring it up in therapy.

 * He accuses you of picking on him, hurting his feelings, or rubbing it in when you try to talk about the effect his abuse had on you.

 * He claims that you caused or contributed to what happened, or implies in any way that he can't or won't stop being violent until your behavior improves.

 * He brings up good things he's done lately, or points out how long he went without abusing you. Abuse is unacceptable. You can't wean off it, or have it as a once-in-a-while treat. Every time it happens, it's reinforcing the idea in the abuser's head that violence is a valid reaction.

This isn't an exhaustive list by any means, but it's something to keep in mind. Good luck; I hope things get better for you soon.",1589727773,fqx7yph,t3_glfogz,/r/domesticviolence/comments/glfogz/has_anyone_gotten_past_violence/fqx7yph/,1,domesticviolence,comment
14798,gothmommy13,t2_63jpb4xw,"I would trust me I know, I figured that out later on because I found out that when you have abusive parents like I did you tend to gravitate towards partners that are the same way as your parents because as messed up as it sounds that's what's normal to you.

I'm not surprised that my mother called CPS on me. She's always threatening to do it to everybody and she did it to my sister. I'm not worried about it though because the worker hasn't been back or called me for two weeks so I'm taking that as a good sign. Plus if they were going to take my son they would have done so the day she came out and they would have arrested me right then and there like if they were going to.

I've done nothing wrong and I haven't harmed my son and they both know it. I'm not surprised that my mom teamed up with my ex to do this. He went to her house and my brother's houses looking for me. When I found out that he had done that I knew it was only a matter of time before CPS was going to show up on my doorstep and sure enough.

14799,Reallysillystupid,t2_6ggj2ahc,"I read what does he do that and men who batter by Adam Jukes. Adam Jukes said that the only way a man can change is to admit that it's his fault and that he is in control. That he chose to act that way, that he didn't lose control. Men often blame something other than themselves. They blame their SO or they blame their looks in control of emotions or alcohol. 

After Adam Jukes convinced them that they are in control, that they chose to be a violent person to maintain power and control, these men are often either suicidal or homicidal. And depressed. He said without feeling depressed, a man can't our won't change. 

It's a long hard road to convince a man that it's in his control, that it's his fault, not her fault, and then for him to change good mindset to stop abusing. 

Their abusive mindsets are:

1) Dismissive attachment style, where they put themselves in a pedestal but put everyone else down in their minds.

2) They have a fear of being dominated and controlled so they are dominating and controlling. Their abuse is because they went to dominate.

3) They have a fear of intimacy and abandonment so they will often be cold and distant so they won't lose anything. It's like a way of protecting yourself through a preemptive strike. You can't be hurt to lose what you never really had.

I forget what else went through an abusers mind.",1589728676,fqx9up4,t3_glfogz,/r/domesticviolence/comments/glfogz/has_anyone_gotten_past_violence/fqx9up4/,1,domesticviolence,comment
14800,Poisonskittlez,t2_11i93h,"Unfortunately, the general consensus, as well as my personal experiences with it says that the answer is no, you cannot have a healthy relationship after there's been abuse. 

Your guys' relationship is not built on a healthy foundation. You mentioned that there was violence on his part even at the beginning of the relationship. That alone is alarming, because there wasn't even the typical ""honeymoon phase"" where everything seems perfect, until they show their true colors. You can't try and rebuild a healthy relationship out of something that was never healthy to begin with. His behavior (and to a lesser extent yours, as you mentioned controlling and jealous behavior) have already set a precedent for how you two interact. Once certain lines have been crossed, it permenantly changes the dynamic.

While the jealousy and controlling on your part was not okay, either, you need to know that that is not an excuse or cause for his violence towards you (does he say things like ""I was only like that because of your controlling behavior!""), and being jealous or controlling is not equal to physical violence (or ""we both made mistakes in the past""?)

What you're seeing now is part of a cycle. There is the 'remission' period (the 3 months of no violence) in which things are starting to seem good again and you slowly get more comfortable, but at the same time, tension is building because an abuser gets tired of putting on a 'show' (playing the perfect boyfriend) to the point where there is a new incidence of violence, in this case, over something as small as turning off a light, when the abuser reverts back to their abusive behavior. 

Afterwards, typically there will be apologies and ""love bombing"" because the abuser realizes that the victim is now wary again, and they need to convince them to stay, in order to maintain control. And then the cycle repeats, typically with shorter intervals between physical abuse, and escalating violence. 

My honest advice would be to leave now before it escalates. You mentioned that he is, to paraphrase ""great otherwise"" but that's what nearly everyone (as well as myself when I was in that position) thinks, in an abusive relationship. 

If the abuser was only 100% awful, from the getgo, then the victim would be much likelier to leave. That's one of the reasons many victims don't do so sooner. Because it's not *all* bad, and they cling onto hope that it was just a one-off thing, or just a slip up, or that maybe if they just do x,y,z, they can help the abuser change. 

But you can't. And it's not your job to try. You will find someone who respects you, and doesn't have to go to therapy to do something as simple as not hurt you.

14809,lisab2020,t2_63pr1a1x,"I read your post and it really helped to validate and trust my own instincts. I knew it was coming, even though he hadn't thrown the first punch yet. When it  escalated to an event where he threatened to kill the dog with a bat in front of our 8 year old son, I grabbed both my child and the dog an ran out the door. I drove to my Dad's house in Denver. He met me at the door at  10 p.m. or so,  yelled at me for dragging my child out that late. I pushed past him through his spacious, well-decorated home to the downstairs bedroom, tucked my son into bed   (and me too).  We were traumatized. One of two things happened on my drive from outside of Boulder to Denver: 1) my ex-husband either called ahead to my Dad, or his wife,to cover his behavior with some lie (very likely), and/or 2) my Dad's wife was jealous and didn't want us on their doorstep.  We needed support, especially the child. THIS is why women don't leave because for the next 15-20 years, my ex spent most of his time abusing us  AFTER I left him by manipulating all communications between relatives and friends, brainwashing my son, lying, threatening, and manipulating the courts. YES, you should leave before he does more damage!  I am glad I did. BUT, the system is the wrong model to get these guys really out of our lives. NO CONTACT WITH CHILDREN, if any, and NO CONTACT with the woman - NONE.

After this happened, the Court restricted his visitation but my Dad and his wife would go around the Court's order and help him see the child more when he was actually dangerous and becoming more so. They were too stupid and lazy  and selfish to investigate further. I, like you, was devastated they betrayed us like they did.  You want to know what contributes to the DV deaths of women and children? People like your ex-husband's sister, people like my Dad, his wife, my moronic brother (who just wants my Dad's money when he dies).  

Regardless, surround yourself with true friends and true family. Get a therapist for support (you might have to get pro bono or pay for support this way but make sure they understand DV because there are many who say they do when they hang their shingle but you will soon find they just wanted the business).

Thank you for sharing what happened to you. My uneducated dummies of a family continued to blame me for jumping out without a net like I did because my intuitive sense was he was going to really hurt me, destroy my face with one punch (he is very strong).

The sad part is that the Court didn't try hard enough (and I went broke trying) to get my son out over of years, because these criminals WILL turn to hurting the kids too (and these children have no one to protect them).

Timing is everything! See the Susan Cox Powell story out of Utah. If you can, leave.

I also should have left when my son was 10 months old, not 7 years later when he was old enough to become even more of a pawn.  The longer you stay, the more entwined with mortgages, pets, children, mutual friends, family.

I know that, but after 3 years I have more than enough evidence of his controlling behavior, insults, and general insanity to shut him down if he tries to mess with our parenting plan. 

(Ex. ""Don't you dare let some quack inject our children with a Corona virus vaccine! And the WHO COVID tests are absolutely not ok. They're using them to infect people so the One World Government can impose a police state."" Seriously. It's like this all the time. ADHD medication, antidepressants for a suicidal child, vaccines, anything more than a bandaid is a conspiracy. But he's a Trump fanatic, too. Oh, and alien overlords are a threat. I can't keep up.) 

Only 6 and a half years more until our son turns 18 and I can go completely no contact. (Yes, I'm counting.)

Our relationship was great BUT I was verbally abusive the past few years until one night I was physically violent. Nothing extreme as broken bones or bruises but enough to have a police call and spend the night in jail. What I can tell you is, if someone wants to change they can. Your husband may have had extreme trauma from his past that affects his current relationship, but it's no excuse for his actions. He needs to take 100% accountability for everything he's not, if not there is no saving him. Seperation and removing yourself from the immediate danger should be your first step find help with friends and family. Your husband needs to go through his own recovery alone.

Also, get a divorce lawyer. You’ve been staying at home and you all are married. He doesn’t have a right to all the money and he’s shutting off utilities?! That’s not going to go well for him in court. You should get half of things since being married, plus child support for your son going forward. You could argue for full custody, not split, because he’s abandoning you and preventing you from caring for his child.

15298,Reallysillystupid,t2_6ggj2ahc,"My mom told me that my father was abusive when they first got married. That he was violent. My mother is from Brazil and of Portuguese ancestry. You don't f*** around with those people. My mom said that he stopped abusing her because he was afraid he was going to die.

My mom said that they stop doing this but just until recently the Portuguese way was if the Portuguese family found out that there daughter is being abused by her husband, they will go and kill the husband because it's disrespectful to the family.

I'm born in America and I don't have much interaction with Brazilians or the Portuguese so I don't know how true this is but this is just what my mom says.

I don't know what my mom did to intimidate my father, but my mom was is the youngest of 12 kids that you had a lot of older brothers that she didn't get along with it she even had fist fights with her older brothers so she's used to fighting men.

15301,WaitingInTheWings812,t2_3z1alpau,"No, you aren't crazy - there's seriously something wrong with your ex. 

If you can, get an electrician to check your toaster and explain what happened and what your ex claimed it to be. The electrician will then be able to advise you on where to go next. DON'T USE YOUR MICROWAVE UNTIL YOU CAN GET IT SEEN TO. If it's blown up, it's definitely dangerous. Take the plug out of the socket and don't plug it back in until you've had it looked at. You can then use what the electrician says as part of your evidence against him for your restraining order. 

If you can't get an electrician out, call 101 (non emergency police number) or whatever your local equivalent is and tell them straight away. You may be in serious danger - if he's told you he's planning on killing you, and he's tampered with your microwave (your microwave wouldn't blow up just from having the wires moved, he's lying to you), who knows what other electrical appliances he could have tampered with? 

I really fear for you OP. Tell the police everything you've written here, even if the electrician does say your microwave is fine. Tell them he's tampered with it, they may give you permission to change the locks so he can no longer enter your house. Please let me know how this goes, I'm worried about you. You can do this &lt;3

15314,Reallysillystupid,t2_6ggj2ahc,"Yes, I've watched a few videos in the grey rock method. Some narc type abusers get off on both negative or positive emotions. They like it. So being neutral may help. But they may step up their harassment of you when you are neutral because they really want that reaction.

I watched a lot of videos on YouTube about Narcissists. The more I listened, the weirder they sounded. They sounded like aliens. 

It was just too weird of a concept so I wrote in the YouTube search engine I'm a narcissist. Usually Narcissists don't know they are narcissists. But one was self aware enough to create a YouTube channel about it. It was called My Narcissistic Healing. I think this channel has been deleted. I couldn't find it recently.

She said that when she was a child her mother told her that her aunt died. She wanted to smile and act happy. Her mom was crying and sad. That's the first time she realized something was off in her emotions. Since then, she was always watching people to see their emotions and copy them. She wouldn't know the correct way to act unless she was copying them. 

She said her favorite emotion to see other people have was anger. She used to purposely make people angry because that's what she enjoyed the most.

Her least favorite emotion to see was happiness. She didn't like to see people happy so she purposely messed with people to create that in them. Other people's happiness made her feel bad about her problems.

She said she knew right from wrong. But she just didn't care. She said she could feel empathy, but she just cared too much about herself to care about anyone else. 

I know someone who's very boring. If they watch a 1 hour movie, she'll take 2 hours explaining the plot. If she reads a book she feels the need to tell you everything that happened in a long story. She monopolized the conversation and you can't get a word in edgewise. Also, she's really into celebrity gossip. I know nothing about celebrities. Most actors and actresses and musicians, I have no clue who are any of the people she tries to talk to me about. Maybe try boring him like that. Whew.

My best advice, whenever he is harassing or hurti my you (or trying to), ignore ignore ignore—AND save the messages should court ever happen to show his pattern, but delete the text thread so it’s not a constant reminder.

It sucks when you’re trapped to communicate with them forever. If it ever becomes too much and you ask him outright to stop, you can get a version of a protective order where any future harassment or non-necessary contact will be punished by jail time or a fine (if the judge isn’t so DV-advocate).

15339,gothmommy13,t2_63jpb4xw,"I want you to read the book why does he do that, inside the minds of angry, controlling men by Lundy Bancroft. It really opened my eyes to what was really going on. Abusers don't have an anger problem, they're abusive, plain and simple. Anger management will not help them and I am going to tell you that couples counseling won't work either in this situation. A lot of times the abuser will get mad at the things that the victim is saying in counseling and will use it against them later.

Abuse is a cycle. You were in what was called the honeymoon phase until recently. This is where there will be a build-up of tension, they explode and then there's an incident and then they're apologetic again. You can go for long periods of time with there being no incidences of violence. They're usually shorter though.

 He is going to do this again. I don't care how much he tries to tell you he's not going to. I listened to when my ex told me it wouldn't happen again after he choked me the first time and he ended up doing it like six or seven more times throughout the course of our two and a half year relationship.

I know you may not be ready yet but I advise you to take steps to get out of this relationship. Please don't wait until you end up like me, so deep in that by the time you get out you're so traumatized it's like coming out of a fog.

The best thing you can do for her is better your situation and get out of there and go to school, get a great job, start your life as an adult and be available for her so that she may have an option in the futire to get away herself.

Anyway she eventually left him when she was around 19/20. After that he got with a new girl, it took a few weeks but he calmed down. He stopped harassing my friend and started coparenting with her, he apologised for his actions and completely calmed down.

We live in a small city and I saw him often after the breakup and still do now 10 years later, he’s still calm. He often just smiles and nods to acknowledge me, a few times he has asked how I am. He has thanked me for looking after her when he was being disgusting and gives me updates on their daughter. Somehow, somewhere along the way he changed.

If the people at the clinic try to pressure you to report and you don't want to, you can remind them that in SC they aren't obligated to. One always hopes that people are up to date on their obligations, but it's always good to know your rights and advocate for them just in case.

16302,coy__fish,t2_222dpyjt,"No one is cruel and hurtful all the time. Not even the worst, most violent people you can imagine. Not even the people serving prison time for assaulting or killing their partners. They wouldn't have been able to maintain relationships if they were always that way.

It's very rare for things to get better in a relationship where one person threatens, screams, and throws things at the other. What actually happens, most of the time, is things get worse. 

I personally held out for a long time thinking maybe my partner was one of the rare ones who really could do the work to get better, or maybe he was right that I caused his bad behavior and could help him by being better. Unfortunately, I was wrong.

I want to tell you a story about an incident that helped me understand that working on myself wasn't improving my relationship. I'm not a very tidy person. I am constantly forgetting laundry in the washer and having to redo it, or leaving dishes until the sink is full. So I understood when my ex was upset with me for not keeping up with the mess, and I did my best to improve. Soon I was in the habit of keeping the clothes and dishes clean and put away, scrubbing the bathroom down weekly, vacuuming every few days. Yet somehow things got worse rather than better.

It seemed there was no such thing as clean enough. I am covering up the details here, but you can click them to read. &gt;!If he caught a single task undone, he'd fly into a rage. He screamed at me for leaving a sealed package of food out of the pantry and threw me to the floor when he ran across a folded pair of pants I hadn't put away yet.!&lt;

My flaws were not the cause of his anger. They were just a convenient outlet for it, and he'd always find a new outlet no matter how hard I tried. And do you know what? Even if I were an unquestionably terrible, greedy, and lazy person, I wouldn't deserve to be screamed at. The same goes for you.

I understand why you're hesitant to leave. Leaving can escalate a partner's behavior quickly. But even if you stay, things will most likely escalate. Even if he has never physically harmed you, throwing things at you legally counts as physical abuse in some places, and threats to kill indicate an increased risk of lethal violence, even if they may not seem serious. You might want to [try this assessment](https://www.dangerassessment.org/DA.aspx) and, ideally, chat with someone at one of the resources on the sidebar about your results. 

If you decide to move toward leaving, they can help you figure out what to do about things like the cats. If you decide not to leave for now, I want to ask you to keep that assessment in mind, and consider whether his behavior is causing the score to go up over time.

Good luck. You can always post here if you need a place to get your thoughts straight, or if you just need some support.",1589473161,fqm87s9,t3_gjj42d,/r/domesticviolence/comments/gjj42d/im_too_insecure_to_leave_help/fqm87s9/,1,domesticviolence,comment

You think you’re in love, but you’re obsessed with what you think is love. He doesn’t love you. He likes controlling and abusing you. This love is sick. You could really benefit from taking time away from him. Since it’s quarantine, stay with your family or a friend. Don’t be trapped with this monster and allow him to keep hurting you. I’m sad for you because I know you’re ‘in love’ and wont leave him probably until he really hurts you or when he finally takes everything away from you and he’s caused you to separate from your friends and family. Good luck to you.

Edit. You’re not of low value. He is. I also want you to see how you’re hiding and protecting a rapist. You need to know he’s raped you. When someone doesn’t listen to no, they are raping you. A good healthy relationship isn’t about hiding anything. I got out of 2 abusive relationships, there has to be a time when you’re alone and grow to know yourself without any other person. And don’t you dare get pregnant and damn a kid into this bullshit abusive life.",1589475329,fqmctib,t3_g32tte,/r/domesticviolence/comments/g32tte/my_24f_boyfriend_of_two_years_29m_is_abusive_i/fqmctib/,1,domesticviolence,comment

16307,PrincessShhhhh,t2_q416uxq,"Okay, let's break this down a bit. You are afraid to leave. You feel like your presence in his life is ""saving"" him. But, he is actively struggling with alcoholism and not seeking help himself. You feel worn down. You feel confused. You know something is wrong. He insults you. He breaks your things. He threatened to kill you.  


This is a ""mindfuck"" because he is manipulating you, abusing you, isolating you and acting unpredictably. In many ways, he is behaving as if he supports and loves you. However, in many significant other ways, he is acting like he has no respect for you and he despises you.  


I am not going to tell you it will be easy to leave. It won't. He's ground down your self esteem to believing you are worthless, helpless without him. He's threatened you, so you are afraid of making him angry. He is teaching you - a caged animal, not to escape even if the door of the cage is open. Do you understand? It is called learned helplessness and it is very real.  


But the door IS open. It was always open.  


Ask yourself, what is the best case scenario here? He get sober, gets a therapist, gets on medication and actually admits he's an abusive twat and then learns alternate coping mechanisms and suddenly respects you as a human being?   


Keep dreaming, sweetheart. Abuse escalates. Abusers don't get help. It's so rare it's not even worth talking about.  


Here is a helpful [link](https://www.drugrehab.com/guides/domestic-abuse/) regarding substance abuse and domestic violence.

16310,PrincessShhhhh,t2_q416uxq,"Try to treat this like a hostage situation - her boyfriend is monitoring her texts, calls, posts, etc. If she answers in his presence, she cannot be truthful or there will be negative consequences for her.   


If you can get her over the phone, try asking things like, ""if you want to come live with us, say 'I can't talk right now,'"" or ""if he is listening, say 'I'm just tired'.""  


I would recommend being more assertive, firm and direct. She needs help. You suspect she is in trouble. What is stopping you from doing everything you can to help your daughter? She needs a place to stay, she needs help cutting contact with her ex-boyfriend, she needs help establishing care with a therapist, etc.   


If you suspect something is wrong, something probably is.   


Your daughter may not be ready to leave and come home, but please continue to let her know loud and clear that anything she needs, anytime she needs it, you are here for her. If she needs to leave at 3am, you can help her with that - and be willing to do it!

16798,coy__fish,t2_222dpyjt,"There is this concept in behavioral psychology called an ""extinction burst"". It basically means that when a person loses access to something they are used to having, they will spend a while going absolutely all out in order to get that thing back.

For example, let's say you have a kid who whines and cries at bedtime every night until you give in and let them stay up longer. One day, you decide - that's it, this isn't good for my kid and this isn't good for me, bedtime is bedtime from here on out. So what happens? Of course the kid whines and cries louder and longer than ever, for a while, because they are used to that kind of behavior eventually getting them what they want.

This can happen in relationships, too. What is happening to you once happened to me. Whenever I questioned my ex's behavior or our relationship, whenever I showed doubt that everything bad between us was my fault, he would double down on shouting and blaming and insulting. He was afraid of me leaving, and afraid of me realizing that his abuse was unacceptable, so he escalated the methods that had worked for him before. 

When I finally left him, I heard a lot of what you're hearing now. I am including specifics in case they might help you or anyone else feel less alone, but covering them with spoiler tags for anyone who would rather not see them. He pulled out all the stops to make me feel guilty, including &gt;!claiming he was about to commit suicide because of me!&lt;. He ramped up the threats, saying he would &gt;!kill anyone who tried to keep him from getting to me, and he told me their deaths would be on my conscience!&lt;. He made me feel that all my worst fears were about to come true. As time went on and it became clear that I was not going to give in, he cycled through sadness and rage, threatening and begging, trying to land on a method of pulling me back in that would work.

But it does end. What got me through it was reminding myself that he would not get better if I gave in. I still cared about him and wanted him to get help, and I knew he would fall back into the same old patterns if I wasn't able to show him that I was serious about leaving. (I also knew that some people do escalate to extreme violence at this stage. I don't think my ex was serious about his &gt;!threats of violence and suicide!&lt; - I think he was just trying to scare me right back into the relationship - but in retrospect, I'm glad I had a friend who called the police at that point to be safe.) 

I don't know how much of this applies to your situation, but it feels similar to me. Even if you don't think my experience has much in common with yours, I want to reassure you that you are making the right choice. You already know that staying with him won't help him or bring the happy times back. He is capable of finding his own way forward in life (though he doesn't want you to know that), and if he chooses not to do that, it won't help anyone to let him pull you down with him.

This is something I wish I'd figured out much earlier: He probably doesn't even believe the cruel things he's telling you. But he wants *you* to believe them so you will feel like your only option is to stay with him.

In case you're worried about your stuff, I thought for sure my ex would destroy everything I left behind, but surprisingly he left it alone. I can't promise you'll have the same outcome, but I hope you're able to get your things back. Please don't agree to being alone with him even for a minute if you go back to the house; if he asks you for a small commitment he will just use the chance to try to push you into a larger one.

This has been a long post, but here's one last thing that helped me get out for good. Abusive partners are often talked about like they are evil master manipulators, and I still can't get that idea to square with the person I knew. When I talk about the reasons why my ex did something, I don't mean to imply that he was literally plotting out his plan to get me back. People like him have less in common with movie villains than with the toddler I mentioned earlier. They are emotionally immature. They act out of anger and sadness and fear. But they are not toddlers, and we are not their parents, so we can't help them. All we can do is realize they are acting the way they act toward us because it works. And then, we stop letting it work.

I left almost ten years ago, and if you have any questions about what things look like from here on out, you can ask anytime. Give us an update if you can; vent whenever you need to. And hang in there. You are going to be okay. You are more than this relationship.",1589383022,fqhrmrl,t3_gixyvt,/r/domesticviolence/comments/gixyvt/i_left_but_he_wont_stop_texting_me_and_my_heart/fqhrmrl/,1,domesticviolence,comment

I'm afraid you have to stand your ground. They can either respect your wishes or you'll have to threaten to cut off the entire family instead of just the brother.

16824,GrindinLife,t2_48z7451b,"You have to love yourself enough to know that you deserve better. No one deserves to be treated the way you are being treated. 

You can and will heal if you want to, and it will take time and it will be a process, but when you look back, it will all be worth it.

I’ve been where you are, and I have a child by a man who absolutely destroyed me mentally, physically, and financially. Wrecked my dreams, I had to give up the progress I made in my career the very year I was going to accomplish the goals that had been 5 years in the making. All the time, hard work, and pushing through failure after failure lead me to losing everything because I let the wrong person into my life.

It’s been almost 3 years since I left him and I am still a little broken, but I am so happy that I loved myself and the life that was growing inside me enough to leave. I was scared, i didn’t know how to leave. Kept making plans that I’d be too afraid to follow through with. One morning he hit me and out of reflex I hit him back. He punched me as I balled up covering my face, and then just went to the bathroom, assuming I’d just keep suffering. As soon as I heard the door close a voice popped in my head that said “RUN NOW!” And I ran. i left with the clothes on my back, grabbed whatever was already in my book bag and ran. I had no idea where I was, we had been staying with his family in Kansas for 2 months since I found out I was pregnant. I saw a church and hid behind a fence. Called my mom, then called the cops. They put me into contact with a woman’s shelter. I was there for a week before he found me. I wound up staying with a cousin I hadn’t even seen in 20 years for the duration of my pregnancy in Colorado. 

Right now I am back to pursuing my passion, and am more financially stable than I’ve ever been. I’m in therapy, and constantly work to dig deep into what happened in my life that lead me to staying in such a bad relationship for so long. 

The truth is, change is hard. And we tend to fear the unknown more than what we are used to, even if what we are used to is abuse. We get used to not loving ourself, not knowing our worth, and feeling as if this is the only way things can be. 

Sometimes in order to get out of a bad situation, you have to choose to do something that feels impossible. You might have to put your goals on hold to save your life. You might have to put your career on hold, move somewhere else, start all over again. But the thing is,  your life is precious. You need to love yourself enough to realize that you’re more than capable of surviving on your own. You are more than capable of starting over and making your life better than you ever thought possible. You are strong, and if your gut is telling you to go, then you should go. 

I know my higher power is what has gotten me through all the turbulence in my life. Sometimes all you have to do in order to figure out how to move forward is to sit and pray/meditate. Have a conversation with yourself. Write it out, ask a question and then answer it with what you feel in your gut. 

I’m not sure how things work in London, but if the have a domestic violence hotline, call it. If they have social services, call them. Ask around about half way houses and women’s shelters for survivors. 

I promise you, leaving will never be the mistake. Staying with someone who makes it impossible for you to feel/be safe, and doesn’t allow you to love yourself will be the mistake. 

Be safe, and God bless.",1589427291,fqkhb02,t3_giybx8,/r/domesticviolence/comments/giybx8/dont_know_what_to_do_please_help/fqkhb02/,1,domesticviolence,comment

16828,rl_cookie,t2_5pzuuny8,"You have to give yourself permission to feel what you are feeling, and not get angry for having those feelings. 

Every single person in a DV relationship has their days and moments where they miss their ex, still love them, feel bad for turning them in. That is normal, don’t punish yourself for having those moments. But once you get that out, remind yourself what is actually happening in reality, that it isn’t your fault for someone abusing you, and they need to face those consequences. Remind yourself that this is for the kids. Really, just using mindful thinking, being conscious of your thoughts and not allowing them to run away with you. It’s not the easiest thing to learn, but there are many articles, YouTube videos and apps out there ab mindful thinking/meditation. Also there are programs out there for therapy and DV survivors that are discounted and sometimes even free. Educate yourself on resources and utilize the hell out of them. 
(Notice I wrote survivor instead of DV victim, again, sometimes just a slight change of mind can make a difference)

I always like the saying ‘when emotion goes up, intelligence goes down.’ You need to start being in tune w your mind, not so much your heart right now. Don’t act during a rush of emotion, or really, make any large decisions in life during a rush of emotion. 

I promise you, those days and moments will get fewer and fewer. You hear the term take things one day at a time, but sometimes we need to just take things one moment, one minute, at a time to get through. 

I’m proud of you, take care of yourself. Nothing ahead will be as bad as it was, bc no matter what struggles lie in the future, at least you will know you and your kids are safe.

16839,Bug_Hugger,t2_1ofeo8a,"This is obviously abuse. 

First things first, you need to get your neck looked at by a doctor. A neck injury can be dangerous. If you see a doctor, there will also be a record of the abuse, in case you need evidence of this later.

Ideally, you should also report this abuse to police, as well as report him for animal abuse. However, it's probably not safe for you to do that if you are stuck living in the same house as him. 

Are there are any adults outside of your household you could reach out to, such as a trustworthy relative or teacher or anyone? Perhaps someone you could live with for a short time while these reports are made and followed up?

In the meantime, it may be worth keeping written records of incidents like the ones you describe. Write down what happened and also the time and date of each incident. If other household members were there at the time, also write down what they did. This may be useful to you later. Make sure that it can't be found of course. 

Best of luck and please do not doubt yourself. Abuse is abuse. If a stranger did the same thing to you in the street you would call the police.

If your counselor suggests setting more boundaries with him (ie not letting him tell you what to do as much) then be careful. It’s good advice for a normal relationship but abusers may become violent if they sense they have less control over you. 

You should work out your feelings and decide. But do know the safest thing to do is to disappear from an abusive man, not break up with them or let them know you are leaving. Don’t give them any time to think about it or physically react. Leaving is the most dangerous time, research shows.

If you're having trouble with the local Law Enforcement Agency, try going to another governmental or non-governmental organization in the area that has public safety as a major responsibility or goal.

For example, if the Police Department is refusing to receive credible and/or verifiable information about a crime, you can try the District Attorney (or local equivalent). Going to another Law Enforcement Agency like the Sheriff's instead of the Police might end up with your getting stonewalled with bureaucratese.

If all else fails, local non-profits like women's shelters or domestic violence prevention organizations might be able to help. They can pack a lot more of a punch than just 1 person if they want to put pressure on the Law Enforcement Agency or go the peaceful cooperation route &amp; connect you with a trusted officer that they have a rapport with.

Police are often domestic abusers [themselves](http://womenandpolicing.com/violenceFS.asp). They notoriously hate being involved in domestic disputes and these sort of he-said-she-said situations. Your neighbor may have been suffering from memory loss and dissociation from the trauma, so they would not have come across as a reliable witness compared to their abuser. Or they also may be terrified of their abuser enough to keep silent and take the blame.  


When you call the police next time, be out in front of the door of your neighbor's apartment. Identify yourself as the caller, then let them know what you heard. Be a witness then.

Its going to take time to deal with coming to terms with the violence and working towards healing after having your entire life up ended. Im glad you are under a protection order, and filing for divorce/custody. Its not what you wanted, you never wanted to be abused. But he made that choice and repeatedly violently abused you. Thats on him. But processing all of the trauma, the shock, its going to take work. As a victim of abuse, please check out victimconnect.org to see if there are services there for you available and check in with your local abuse agency for any resources they may have. Hopefully you can get referred to a qualified therapist experienced in treating victims of abuse. So in the meantime, treat yourself like you would a close friend or loved one having to go through this, with love, compassion and patience. In time, you will heal. Your life will not be in this place. And you will be able to go on and live a healthy and happy life. With help. So reach out for resources.

Unfortunately the reality is that the police don’t care. The other replies from redditors have explained very well. Also, it is so hard to get the judge to properly assess the situation and many judges are not versed in dv cases. The only people that seem to listen and help victims are special advocate groups. Even then, navigating the legal system is a nightmare (I’m doing through it now). 

It also may take the victim a while to testify and press charges against her abuser. It’s a psychological effect. I hope she can find a dv advocate after this. She can move into a shelter or go to court and have him removed from the apartment with an order of protection. 

I would not worry about the authorities knowing you have the evidence. You were in your own home with your peace disturbed. It’s your home you are allowed to video things as you please.

I tracked down my ex's ex, similar situation, he always only ever said terrible things about her, and she refused to engage with me on it. It's possible that he wasn't abusive to her, which is possible - his Dynamics with her may have been different, as she was older than him and more established, where is he was significantly older than me, but I think she just didn't want to talk to me.

17374,CountryStrong89,t2_5v5yav06,"1. Blocking is an easy answer but not an easy action but you NEED to do it. It will drive you nuts not knowing if he's texting you, what he might be saying, etc. But you need to get rid of the toxicity.
2. He has conditioned you to feel this way and if you truly want out ita going to suck. You're going to question everything right down to who you are as a person but from personal experience it is so freeing.
3. By allowing him contact you are still allowing him to change your brain chemistry. Abusers create an addiction like state to them for the abusee. This is why it is so hard to leave and cut all contact.

I called the police on my ex for breaking my bone. I have had to deal with him intimidating me from afar to try to get the charges dropped. I questioned if I really was the piece of shit he made me out to be and had to ignore the voice saying ""it really wasn't that bad"". I got an order of protection against him and had to watch him lie on the stand about who I was, who he was and then watched him call my mom a liar as well. Ive been away since Decemeber. I can tell you, leaving any abuser is not easy, but it is worth it. I have grown so much since then and am stressed with the charges still pending but so much happier. But I didnt want to do any of it. My friends pushed me to call the police (which was a good thing) and for the restraining order. I wrote a note to my lawyer when the judge was giving his conditions ""why do I feel so bad about him not being in my life anymore"". What you are feeling is normal but PLEASE cut contact.

She's probably going to tell you off, and she'll likely move in with him and continue to destroy her life, but there's a chance whatever you tell her stays in the back of her mind for whenever she wakes up and gets the strength to get away from him.

17801,a5121221a,t2_atd2z,"You say you are an abuser.  The story you tell indicates that he is an abuser as well.  He is controlling and has manipulated you and your family.  Some abusers are skilled at making their victims look like the crazy person and look like the abuser.  Your story isn't the first time it has happened and is often a reason a victim is not supported by her/his own family and friends.

He needs to leave now.  If he won't accept breaking up, I can think of three possible solutions (there are probably others).  

First, before either of my suggestions about getting him to leave, you need to sit down with your parents and anyone else in the house and ask them to support you in breaking up with him and getting him out of the house.  Ask them to support you because you know you are doing the right thing, even if they love him.  Ask them to give you six months (or name your time frame) before they ask for details on why you know it is the right decision and make it clear that you will discuss your reasons, but not now and not while he is still in your life.  Hopefully they will agree and support you, demonstrating that they respect your ability to make decisions about your own life.  Give them the option to help him, but only if he completely stays out of your life and your house (for example, if they want to help him search for an apartment or suggest an uncle who can let him crash on his couch for a week, that's fine as long as he doesn't contact you and stays away from your house).  You can't stop them from caring about him, but hopefully they care about you more and respect your boundaries.  

Three ways you can get him out are: 

(1) say you'll consider remaining in a relationship with him if he moves out (not even a toothbrush stays in your house...he can bring a bag when he visits), then give him a chance to move everything out, take a short time to verify that it definitely won't work, then break up with him.  Go no-contact, if possible, so he can't continue to manipulate you.  You don't want to risk physically hurting him and ending up in jail because he knew how to press your buttons.

(2) A formal eviction with the support of your family.

(3) A protective order.  While he has not yet physically hurt you, he has restrained you against your will, keeping you in a room you want to leave and you've had to be physical to get out.  If you call a local domestic violence organization, they may be able to help you with the forms you need to file.  EVE (End Violent Encounters) was very helpful to me.  They can't give legal advice and can't write anything for you, but they can often be a resource to show you which forms are necessary and tell you where to file them.

17809,ImYesILeffHisAss2398,t2_2egrzrvq,"I think its important to keep a few things in mind. First, if the child is in his Mothers care, can you be certain that she will actually push back against this persons behavior or involvement? Her own child? Will she put your child first? Or would a court based supervised visitation center be more safe? 

As to whether or not he should have rights, he is the childs father, there is no denying that. But the courts dont work on morals, they work on the law and often they do not overlap. So when you are making choices, it can be easy to be worn down instead of continuing to fight, as this has been a prolonged drawn out battle with him denying the abuse happen. So you need to think about these things, think about settling, what settling would look like, what going to court will look like, and how this may end up.

As to you working to make sure he maintained the relationship, thats not really your job. Its his job to ensure he maintains the relationship and you need to make that be his job. You worry about your relationship to your child. Dont make it your job to try to get him to care or be an active parent, or put all the effort into getting him to bother to parent. Drop the rope.

Listen, it's not okay for him to hit you. There is a way to get out and get help. People care about you and can give you access to everything you need and keep you safe.

First step is to gather important documents, next is come up with a safety plan. (If you can't do that make a run for it safely to a safe spot and call the police.) Check out a domestic abuse hotline. Some police departments have victims advocates and will help you get into connection with shelter's and legal issues. 

I never knew there were so many programs and assistance. It's not fun, but I am spending the night in a safe place and I feel safe and free.

17834,throwaway384883,t2_6g6z2eec,"Just wanted to say this:

1. Your reaction is completely normal. At 16, I couldn’t not handle being punched in my stomach by another 16 year old girl. At 26, I could not handle it from my abusive ex. A 35 year old woman with a completely unconditioned body is going to be incapacitated when a grown man punches her in the stomach. Source: I’m close to 40 and shudder to think what would happen to me if someone did that to me.

2. I understand that you are still around him right now. If there’s any indication that he’s going to hit you like that again, you need to protect your organs from harm. Fold your arms across your belly as tightly as you can, try turning your body away from him. Yes, it’s awful to get hit in your face and it’s natural to raise your arms to protect your face, but as you’ve just learnt - your stomach is a much more delicate, pain-sensitive part of your body. The stuff in there is absolutely not meant to withstand blunt trauma.

3. As others have already said, you need to get your abdomen examined by a doctor. Aching and cramping for two days is a sign that he battered you to the point of internal injuries.

4. You need to get food in your body, desperately. I know how difficult it is. I still think of it when I eat, some 12 years after my ex punched me there. You suddenly realize that your body is prone to being hurt in a way that you’d never even considered before. And you’re always paranoid about someone doing that to you again. Try to bring food into the room you’re hiding out in. Lock the door behind you and eat until you’re full. Don’t unlock the door or go outside until your food is digested. This way you can eat in peace, knowing nobody is going to hurt your stomach and induce sickness/vomiting. I have a feeling a lot of the pain you’re feeling is from being deprived of food for two days.",1589232802,fqb98io,t3_ghr76r,/r/domesticviolence/comments/ghr76r/my_husband_punched_me_for_the_first_time/fqb98io/,1,domesticviolence,comment

It's entirely possible that you are acting out being bitchy, nagging or being rude due to experiences felt during your previous abusive relationships. Some people lash out as they do not know how to deal with these situations.

What I do know is that you must seek help urgently or you will not be able to have a successful relationship in life. If you really love this man and don't want to hurt him, then you must start helping yourself first. Speak to a counselor or a therapist and get the help you really need.

17853,Lamzn6,t2_4n3bt,"Oh god. Where to start. 

The sad reality is that you’re at the very beginning of this and you probably won’t want to leave. It took me about 10 years. 

Everyone here is going to tell you that if they hit you once, they will hit you again, which is absolutely true. 

The issue that keeps you from leaving isn’t the physical abuse, it’s the psychological manipulation that comes with it, that makes you stay. 

What he did to you is absolutely never okay. It indicates that he doesn’t respect you, whether it’s because he can’t or he won’t. Either way, even if love had been there before, it won’t be there again. Love is action. Please start to realize that the poetic idea of love we are brainwashed into believing, doesn’t actually exist. Love is not a feeling. It’s a decision and state of being. 

If someone was truly just having a mental break down and only hit you once, they would immediately realize the gravity of the horror of what they did. But he didn’t. He doesn’t get it. He’s not going to. The struggle here will be your acceptance that any love without boundaries is a false and superficial love. 

I resented people telling me to leave because it seemed to be a dismissal of my complex feelings of my abuser, who at times had cared for me very deeply. But this was false reasoning on my part, because no matter what he may have done for me at one point, respect was permanently lost. 

Love feels like respect. 

I wish you would just leave immediately, but I know that I wasn’t able to for a number of reasons, so I try not to judge others who tolerate this. 

Eventuality you have to leave.

Edit: call the cops and tell them he has you trapped. If that doesn’t work, get a knife a stab his stomach. You are in danger. You need to find it in you to face this. Please please please for the love of god, listen to people who went through this. We know better than you even though it might not seem like it. Do not let this person kill you.

17860,Postbunnie,t2_12acfk,"Couples counseling is for couples who share joint responsibility for their issues. (E.g. One half lacks communication skills, the other has unrealistic expectations of their partner, etc.) Most importantly, its for the people in relationships who can accept their mistakes and shortcomings and truly want to gain the knowledge and tools they lack to promote a healthy dynamic. It absolutely does not work when one partner wants to control the other, or is completely and ultimately self centered. 

Relationships that involve Domestic violence have crossed that line. Not to over simplify- but in most cases it basically can be boiled down to “getting their way, however they can- up to and including violence.” It can be ESPECIALLY dangerous for the victim of violence to open up about the abuse in therapy. Sometimes leading to much more extreme injuries. That’s why it’s never recommended. It’s not worth the risk-  that YOUR partner won’t beat you for “betraying them.” 

Therapy is wonderful. It can really help a lot of people. But standard psychotherapies are not helpful for a man who has the fundamental thinking errors, cultural reinforcement, and core values  that tend to coexist/justify their abusiveness and violence. Those men need an experienced counselor who can call them on their BS. One who doesn’t give them fodder which they then use to excuse their behavior. Ideally? They need something called a Batterers Intervention Program. They need to first and foremost understand and accept that the ONLY justification of force is imminent threat to bodily harm, and EVEN THEN one can only use the minimum amount of force necessary to remove themselves from the situation. 

But, to help you answer your own question, see if your partner will start by working through this:

I used to think it was because my abuser struggled with drugs, alcohol and sexual assault HOWEVER, he is just an abuser who struggles with this things. He went to a drug an alcohol class, anger management and seemed like an amazing and changed man.

It took years for him to revert to his behavior to get me back - because the ""I'm a changed good man"" show was a long invested attempt to get me back. Today, I'm living in hiding because my abuser thinks I'm cheating on him when he doesn't once consider that I'm in fear for my life.

Abusers always will put their feelings and needs first - they do not make decisions (ever) about your needs being an important factor in their thought process.

I lived with my abuser for 15 years and I thought I knew everything about him. But over the years he has become more intense and scary.

He won't change unless he makes that decision and it is not up to us to facilitate that change.

I know you might be lonely and sad, that's how they get us to keep coming back. For me, once I started working on myself (therapy for CPTSD from a bad childhood) I started to love and respect myself. For the first time ever, I realized I don't need to be in a relationship to feel loved and respected.

Leaving an abuser is a long and hard process, but you're not in this alone. Love yourself first sis and everything else falls into place.",1589282082,fqd77un,t3_ghzks3,/r/domesticviolence/comments/ghzks3/does_it_get_better_after_help/fqd77un/,1,domesticviolence,comment

I had already filed a restraining order but he has yet to be served. It wasn't until I firmly and constantly fought to get someone to listen that my needs are IMPORTANT that someone eventually truly helped.

Don't take no for an answer and don't let anyone put you aside until you are satisfied that you have the tools you need.

He almost seems like himself like he was before my brother died 5 years back but I know drug use is still done but he seems more...reluctant? To do anything these days (I guess I hope it stays that way) but he still has his moments and has assaulted me twice but I don’t really care about it but I quiet often have dreams where he has killed my mum or is even just seeming vaguely threatening in the dream and it can happen out of no where. But I also have dreams about my brother and my dog (18 years old just died a year ago best friend and all) dying slowly all over again. I suppose it’s just a way that our minds deal with trauma but I get you when I have these dreams they stick with me for days and then everyone’s like “it’s just a dream it’s not a big deal” so I get what you mean,1589149686,fq7pohh,t3_ggxqz3,/r/domesticviolence/comments/ggxqz3/does_anyone_have_nightmares_that_come_and_go/fq7pohh/,2,domesticviolence,comment

If you don’t have any info on where she is or if she is getting abused, there’s not a whole lot you can do except give her resources such as the number to a DV hotline (1-800-799-7233) or offer your support and assistance. You also have to keep in mind that if she is being abused, her abuser might be able to see her Facebook comments/ messages, her voicemails, texts, etc. and you don’t want them to know that she is trying to leave/get help. If I were you, I would let her know in a very vague way that if she needs anything, she can contact you, and maybe give her email, phone number, Facebook messenger, whatever you’re comfortable with. 

You’re a good person for being concerned, I wish it was easier to help people in situations like this. But ultimately, in cases of domestic violence, unless she is a minor, it’s pretty much up to her to leave/ get help.

You’re actually really switched on - the first step is awareness - most people don’t even get there they are so deep in the fog of abuse; you’re learning the language for things so you can identify them when they happen. You’re ahead of the game just by being aware. Keep practicing that awareness. Fight the abuse fog by keeping a regular diary. Record incidents. Gather evidence for for your future self. Write short notes to your future self about how you are feeling - remind yourself that it was really “that bad” when you finally do leave and find yourself pink clouding over him. The chemically dependant brain will play tricks on you, just so it can get another hit. You’ve got to document what you can now - how you’re feeling, what’s happened. Truth and reality is your life line right now. Trust yourself, trust your perceptions, don’t let them make you doubt yourself. You know what you know, you see what you see, you hear what you hear.

18810,juliac210,t2_ttado19,"I’m so sorry this happened to you and your son. Unfortunately, as others have mentioned, strangulation specifically is linked to increased risk of homicide. In other words, it’s really dangerous behavior. If the act itself doesn’t kill you, it is at the very least, a red flag for more dangerous, potentially lethal behavior to come. 

On top of this, you might notice other things like memory loss, or feeling foggy, having a hard time concentrating, having light and noise sensitivity. All of these things are indicative of a potential brain injury. You should go get checked out ASAP. 

I agree with the user who said you should have a plan for leaving when you’re ready. It’s so hard to “just leave” especially after ten years of marriage and a son! But, it would be good to have a plan just in case. Call a domestic violence hotline when you are safe and alone and advocates can help you make a plan.

18826,metalman675triple,t2_5nwcoajm,"That's harassing him, the courts think if you were REALLY afraid you'd stay away and hide.

Your restraining order against him either includes your extended family, or the laws include your extended family.  It's designed to keep him away, not shield you while you torment him through his family, and doing that will often void the restraining order.

Having said that, if your investigator sucks (possible) then you need to submit a FOIA ( freedom of information act) request to where ever his ex reported him or had him charged to get a copy of the police reports documenting his previous behavior, they are public record, it's good for you to have if you need it in the future or when he gets out, but again that REALLY should have been done by the cops as it's easier and faster for them.  If that comes up dry, and you don't think the prosecutor and investigators have done it even after you've provided them with names, ask them if they'd like you to do it yourself BEFORE you try.  If they still fail then fine, but document or record the conversations so you aren't accused of harassing him through his family, be neutral ""contacting you regarding his violent behavior"" vs ""member' when he got turnt up and tried to murder me!!!""


To be blunt, if you want evidence and documentation that's how you get it, stop being dramatic and shit stirring contacting his mom/ex/who ever.  The part of you that's tickled about doing that is related to the damaged and dysfunctional part of yourself that got you into this mess.

You don't want to leave right now because you have been **traumatized**, and you are now fighting a **trauma bond**.

Believe it or not, it is a **chemical dependancy** that is as strong as Heroin. But **you can overcome it**.

The longer you stay, the more difficult it will become.

**Abuse amnesia** will begin to set in, your memory will become **hazy**, you will begin to **rationalize staying** and it will feel nearly impossible to leave by then.

He will then do it again, and send you spiralling even deeper into the **trauma bond**.

**You must leave now.**

Your life is in danger. Men who strangle are men who kill.

Do not put yourself and your child at risk by staying. Do not send your child the message that it is **ok to hurt people**, and that you will not protect him. **You will lose your sons trust if you stay**, and you will also no longer be able to trust yourself.

There is enormous long-term damage in staying - damage to yourself and to your child. Your son will grow to resent you if you stay, and you will resent yourself even more.

**This is a pivotal moment.** 100% of the women who stay say it is the biggest regret of their lives - if they live. Every single one says that if they could do it over again, they would leave the second he placed a hand on them.

File a report immediately and **leave**.

**You can do this.** Bite the bullet. Do it for your son and do it for your future self who will love and thank you every day for the bravery show now.

She even tried locking me up in a room. A desperate and controlling attempt to keep me. Then I started cutting myself. It was the low point I needed to get out of there. Left town and haven't looked back. 

Now I'm happily engaged to a woman I trust and love and she makes me feel beautiful and special. The first night we spent together, I accidentally fell asleep on her chest while she stroked my hair. I have a lot of sleep problems so that was a huge sign of trust for me.

We have been ordered to go to mediation at this point and I’m hoping to change it. 

I don’t want to scare you, but I went to a hearing for his DV charge at the end of February and spoke with the DA. She was concerned he would eventually turn on the kids if I wasn’t there to be his punching bag. He started the standard visitation right after the divorce and he isn’t out right hitting them, but he isn’t caring properly for them either. In my divorce settlement I’m going to ask for a psych and addiction evaluation, anger management, some sort of counseling for abusers, and possibly try to get supervised visits. I’m hopefully on all but the last. 

I actually offered him two divorce settlements in the first six weeks of being separated that would have given him the current visitation schedule.

18864,Paris4always,t2_436fxu0q,"Guys, I’m about 4 🍷 in.      
Last week, my ex-hub fell off a ladder and is in the hospital currently still sedated. He had a trach and g-tube surgery placed yesterday. 
I’m very empathetic, but I’m also a tad ambivalent about it all...our son was 2 when I left him, he’s (my son) now 24 years old, but I’ve kept it a secret about what a monster his dad was to me. I chose not to press domestic violence charges against him way back then for my sons sake, (and mine too, I’m not sure I could have handled it all then) however, considering he used to grab me by the neck and throw me against wall often, the irony is not lost on me that he’s currently in the hospital with a cracked skull and can’t breathe on his own. 

1) It was ‘90’s. I didn’t have an iPhone ready to record every detail.(but, oh how I wish I did!) Times were very different then. He was a police officer and not only threatened to kill me often, but also promised that no one would believe me, and “police don’t cross that blue line”. 
I was young, scared, and believed him! 
DO NOT MAKE THE MISTAKE I DID! GET HELP!

2) I offered joint custody of my son to my ex over 20 years ago. I didn’t press domestic violence charges. (Or any other charges for that matter...it was bad) I had found out that he’d lied on his application to the police department he’d been employed at, and subpoenaed the chief of police to court during our custody battle, who’d said in court that he wasn’t eligible for rehire because he’d lied on his application (typical of his character) I’d assumed that was it, and I was at peace that he’d never work as a police officer again. Little did I know, that he’d end up going to a different police academy (I’m sure, lying thru his teeth again) and eventually getting hired at the exact same mid-west small town police dept. under a different chief over 15 years later. (Apparently they either don’t care, or don’t keep very good records) 
I WAS SEETHING!! 

I’d shown him waaaaay more mercy than he deserved, and over the years, sometimes I was at peace with it, but others, it pissed me off. He tried multiple times thru the years to get full custody off of me. Instead of realizing I’d shown him mercy, he became more of an ass. I spent 10’s of thousands of dollars on my attorney to keep the same arrangement, (I’m a nurse) while he just kept getting new attorneys having not paid the last one in his futile attempts, but I still had to go to court regardless, EVERY TIME! 
( Did I mention integrity was lost on him?) 

Basically, my ex wanted to me to join his “swinger” lifestyle on top of the poor money management style he held. And so basically, I didn’t remotely hold the the same ideals he had and he was way more of a spender and we didn’t have the money for it.  So the short version...he was a control freak...in a bad way.

3) so here I am...a bit over 20 years after the fact. 
...having to tell my son that his father...that he thinks is some police officer hero... is nothing more than (a pedophile, I was 15 when I met him and he convinced me to lie to my parents,)a sex addict, and an abusive asshole. 
NOPE. Mama bear is still gonna keep it a secret.

18866,PGcarlosspicyweiner,t2_3vp5d5ow,"Well. Here’s the rub. Usually in the US, IF the minor goes through the court system and there are relatives deemed capable, they are placed with relatives first. 
It is only if the family requests the minor stay with “friends” that the court would take this into consideration. That’s a BIG if. 
Either way, if the court is involved, any party the minor is in care of will have to be vetted. Meaning, the CPS social worker must deem them fit to care for that minor. 
So here’s the other half of the rub. The people who are already vetted are those who go through the foster care program. 

So if you’re not a relative and if the family doesn’t plead to the court their child live with you, they will more than likely be placed with a foster family in your area. 

It sucks and it’s totally screwed up, but this is how it (for the most part) works. Is there a counselor at your school you can talk to?

He convinced me early on that he was a person other than the real him.  I loved that mirage, but that's all it was.  Smoke and mirrors that convince you to stay in a horror-house.  

Many of us know how awful the sadness feels after leaving.  Maybe when you feel sad, you can try to sort out one thing you loved, to recognize if it was an illusion, then one thing that was real and horrible, and finally, one thing about your life now (good or bad, but genuine).  If you make a list, you can start to use the first two to remind yourself how much better off you are now.  You can use the third list to embrace the good things in your current life and start making baby steps to change the things you don't like.",1589084874,fq4v3tg,t3_ggrk5n,/r/domesticviolence/comments/ggrk5n/i_am_so_sad/fq4v3tg/,1,domesticviolence,comment

Honestly I have been a long-term user so the anxiety factor doesn't affect me as much but it used to be something I would experience.  For some folks, it can really help, for others, it can definitely trigger panic attacks or emotional distress. 

If you do try it, and you have access to medicinal cannabis, first speak with your doctor and then try a lower end THC strain with a trusted friend around. It is usually the high THC that ends up giving people anxiety. 

If you don't have access to medicinal cannabis, start slow and stay low, the dose needed to inhibit dreams is lower than full intoxication.",1589101738,fq5dzem,t1_fq5d0zi,/r/domesticviolence/comments/ggxqz3/does_anyone_have_nightmares_that_come_and_go/fq5dzem/,1,domesticviolence,comment

2. Leave him and stop being abused.

There is no “stay with him and stop being abused option.”

19309,PrincessShhhhh,t2_q416uxq,"Okay, I am going to copy and paste from a previous post:

Please, let me emphasize, **this is a life or death situation**.

Strangulation is a [red flag for homicide](https://www.policyforum.net/red-flag-homicide/). It is the [most lethal form of domestic violence](https://wherestheline.info/strangulation-the-most-lethal-form-of-domestic-violence/). I am quoting from [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2573025/) abstract when I say, "" Prior non-fatal strangulation was associated with greater than six-fold odds (OR 6.70, 95% CI 3.91–11.49) of becoming an attempted homicide, and over seven-fold odds (OR 7.48, 95% CI 4.53–12.35) of becoming a completed homicide."" **If your partner has strangled you in the past, this is a clear, well-documented, well-researched predictor that he will kill you.**

Get out. Get out now.

If he is financially reliant on you, **kick him the fuck out.** Ask a family member or friend to be with you when you do. Then change the locks. Talk to your landlord, tell them about the abuse and see how they can help. Get a restraining order. You do not need much evidence. Photograph your bruises and write down as much of the abuse as you can recollect and handle to present to the judge.

Go to the beach, tell your family what is happening. They may be far away, but they do not want you to get killed. **Ask for the help that you need.**

I remember my ex's mother would always tell me similar things like your mom, saying I needed to calm down, give him space, and that I was at fault too. But you have to be very honest with yourself? Do you really think you deserve to be treated this way by your ex? NO. You deserve love, kindness, and most importantly, respect. 💛 Regardless of what your mom has said, she should see the whole picture and see that what you are going through is toxic, and that you shouldn't have to go through this at all.

More importantly take some time to reflect. Try to analyze the relationship with your partner, truly analyze how it got so toxic. I've been out of my relationship for 6 months, and I'm still pulling back the pieces and relaxing how much I was manipulated, demeaned, and transformed into someone I didn't recognize.

I did that in hs and they said: ""We can't control how a parent disciplines their child"" bringing it up also initially causes more out lashes but in the long run,  prevented them, even though threats and occasional hitting do still occur.

It feels uncomfortable because you are alone, and even worse you are without the person who was the center of your universe. But they put themselves in the center by force. He doesn’t love you. He never did. He loves controlling you. Going back seems safe because it is familiar, but it is the biggest regret you may not live through. Imagine his hate, anger, jealousy and rage now fueled by the fact that you left - how he will use that against you despite his actions being what you were running from. 

It will not get better. He will not get help. You can do this. 

Please, don’t give him the satisfaction.

If you can’t trust yourself not to do the wrong thing - put that responsibility to someone you trust. Let them have your phone. Tell them not to take you back, not until he is gone. Do whatever you have to do to deny yourself these temptations.

Full disclosure, he was white, but he came from a trailer park family and I came from like lower to middle middle class. 

he is not going to change, and frankly it's likely that he may try to sabotage your work or your studies. What is your living situation like? Are both of your names on your apartment? I really think this is a case where you need to get out of the house to take a walk by yourself, and call the national domestic violence hotline. I'm also happy to talk to you over the phone and be discreet and sound like a friend. Signs of aggression like this are scary and dangerous, and you really don't know what he is going to do. I understand that fear of not wanting to put him out on the street and wanting him to be homeless, but he survived without you before, and he will survive without you again. Think about why he's 30 years old and doesn't have any friends. Don't you think a little bit of that could be his own doing? Trust me, I know. Let me know if you need to talk further. Your number one priority needs to be getting out and be safe this weekend, and it sucks that you will be going through the most difficult period of leaving abuse during the pandemic, but you really really really need to do this for yourself. You are not his mother and he is not a child, he will survive without you. Don't let the guilt drag you back in.

19817,blissandblossom,t2_69bdbg6k,"Hi there, so many similar patterns with my ex of 4 years. The holidays discussion (how your spouse never helped or planned anything) was a deja vu moment for me. I thought it was so strange that my ex never cared to plan a romantic date, my birthday, nothing. I would ask, and he said ""I'm not that type of guy, you knew that getting involved with me, and I won't change"".

YES! My ex would do the same thing of running away, shutting down, and even laying down on the floor to ignore me when I would try to communicate with him. It was so absurd! I felt like I was speaking to a child. 

My ex would also hurt me so intensely with words and violence and never be sincerely sorry. I don't think I ever saw him cry except once in our relationship (and it wasn't because we were fighting, it was because a sad scene in a movie).

19834,FifiLeBean,t2_u9fjt,"I'm so glad this made sense to you.
Just fyi, Mr Hyde is the evil one, Dr Jekyll is the ""good"" one in the book.
And the book tells the story that the Dr is like the victim of the evil Mr Hyde, but I think what I have learned is really what happens: they are pretending to be normal, and they are definitely not normal human beings. My ex is a sociopath. Not like the extreme type that is in tv movies and the news, but definitely on the continuum: he has never been able to feel empathy or understanding for anyone, period. He's faked it, but he honestly does not feel it. He has no remorse and is incapable of it. He faked that really convincingly, but then later told me he was flat out lying to me. He has no line that he is unwilling to cross. I tried to explain it to him: that you just don't hurt people, but again, he'd fake understanding or trying to learn, but he was incapable of learning it. 
What helped me to see it was Lundy Bancroft's book. Honestly. I started reading anything he wrote or listening to his audiobooks. My ex even picked up the book and started reading it (not recommended), and then started doing his song and dance act about oh, I see myself in here, I'll get help. He did, but it was the same thing as usual: faking. So I recommend Bancroft's books All The Time. Also, I picked up a book on gaslighting and saw the light, so I was ready for him to suddenly get really bad and I knew what to do when he did. When he said he wanted out, I said how soon? That book prepared me for that moment and told me not to try to talk him into staying or I would be in danger. And I knew it was true because my ex was getting worse in the last year (he moved out in December). 

When you are ready, those domestic violence organizations are FANTASTIC. they won't make the mistakes that your friends will make. They wont get impatient or push you or tell you to get over it and move on, etc. Your friends will just cause you more pressure, shame, and condescension and you don't deserve that. You do deserve and need practical help, and that's what those organizations do. I didn't move into a shelter, but I knew who to call if I needed that suddenly. I didn't do a restraining order, but I was ready to if needed. 

All this to say: yes, you are going through this, and it's ok. It's not your fault, it's not your problem to solve, and maybe most most most importantly: when you are done, he takes the crap with him, and you don't because it was never you that was the problem. He will have all the ownership of the problem. It's all in his head. All you have to do is take care of you, and you'll be fine. 
I'm cheering for you right now, and I'm here to say it does get better. It gets awful for awhile, it might get worse, but there's a way out. And then it gets a hell of a lot better. If you're in danger, be smart and get the help you need to prevent danger on the way out. &lt;3",1588896359,fptqqcm,t1_fppzwt1,/r/domesticviolence/comments/getvm9/how_did_you_begin_to_process_the_fact_that_you/fptqqcm/,1,domesticviolence,comment

She either needs to find a different way to express her frustration and anger or you need to walk away from that marriage - or at least take a break. Nobody should be subjected to that regardless of the situation. I understand having children makes the situation more difficult, but I can’t stress enough - under no circumstance should one have to endure physical abuse. 

Your wife could become a threat to your children eventually. Anger issues are not something people just narrow down to one victim. It is a matter of time until she hurts your children.

19843,Pink_Skink,t2_sqvr1,"The only advice I can give you is to get out of there before it gets even uglier. If the police aren't helping then fuck them. Stay in a homeless shelter for a while if you must, or take your mom to a psychiatric hospital or similar establishment under the excuse that she has talked about (or threatened to) killing herself. At least while she's there, you can freely move around to find a job and somewhere to stay. I don't know how similar France and Belgium are in this regard, but my brother stayed in some sort of mental hospital for a while and it did wonders for him and my family.  


Forget the apartment for now. I don't know if the loan is on your mom's name but even if that's the case, you need to prioritize your safety and hers right now. 

Also, I completely understand you wanting to go to uni right away, but maybe push it off a year or two. You're in a completely understandable situation right now where you need money and a home, and there's nothing wrong with starting your studies later; in fact, for some people it's helpful because you get more time to decide what you want to study.  


Something else I would try is talking to a local church. You may not be religious, but they still may be able to help. At the very least, they could direct you towards the right people or contacts for you to find a solution.

Your perception of whether or not she would ever ""try"" to ""seriously"" harm you is colored by your view that she loves you and this is just a bad behavior that you need to figure out how to change. Shes punched you, kicked you, throws things at you, slapped you, so at what point do you think she is making some choice that this abuse wont ""really"" hurt you that she may make with something else much bigger? I understand you cant leave this minute. That doesnt mean that you cant take steps to protect yourself and your children in the future by leaving. So please, reach out to your local abuse agency. Quietly. Dont confront her, tell her shes abusive, or threaten to leave or divorce. Dont change your behavior or how you react. The abuse agency can help you develop a safe exit plan that may require multiple steps and some time. They can also refer you to a qualified mental health professional experienced in treating victims of abuse. You may not think you have been traumatized, but when someone we love and trust abuse us it can have devastating effects that you dont really see while you are actively in fight/flight/freeze mode, not until you are away and safe. You can also reach out to talk to a lawyer who is experienced in high conflict divorces. Quietly. Talk to them about the situation, how to document the abuse legally. How to store the documentation safely. How much this will cost, what the process will likely entail, how long it will take and what to expect from the court. Get the facts. You can do all of this by phone. You dont want to wake up one day to a false charge of rape, child molestation, or assault charges.

Grieve the relationship you thought you had. Reach out to your local abuse agency to help you with the trauma you have experienced (which is serious and you need an evaluation for PTSD).

I hate to be so...final (for lack of a better word) about what I’m going to say, but if someone had told me this 7 years ago and I had listened, I would not be in an abusive marriage - trapped because I have no income (I’ve always been very independent and made good money, but my mental health declined due to the traumas I’ve had over the last 7 years of this relationship).

He threw me down IN FRONT OF MY 3 YEAR OLD SON. (He’s not the dad, thank goodness).

This was so early on, I could have ran then. I forgave him. I thought it was love.

Now I am living in a nightmare. He’s no longer physically abusive, but he’s mentally/emotionally/verbally abusive and I almost wish he WOULD hit me, then I could call the police. But for some reason, abuse has to be physical/sexual for it to be a crime. 

I’m almost 42 now and I’m struggling to survive until I can find a job after the pandemic is over and places are hiring again.

Please please take the advice you’re getting here. Get out while you can. There is no excuse for anyone to be abusive towards anyone, never mind someone they supposedly love.

Please take care of yourself and reach out if you need to talk. I know the feeling of hiding all of this but also needing to talk about it.

I wish I’d talked about it in 2013. My life might actually be happy now.

I left in the fall of 2018. We tried to coparent, but it was impossible. He just wanted to be verbally abusive in front of the kids. My restraining order didn’t take affect until the spring of the following year. We’ve gone to court where he was given only Saturdays, no overnights. Even then he began to abuse my son. Now they only have 2 hours on the weekends and a supervisor is required. 

It’s been a huge adjustment on our son. He acts the same way. Make sure to give him his time to settle in at home after visits. I’d strongly suggest therapy for him. I know he’s little. Play therapy can help with the emotions he’s dealing with. Domestic violence affects especially the younger children. My child has been in therapy and its helped him with this adjustment.

20304,PrincessShhhhh,t2_q416uxq,"Firstly, here is a directory to some [resources in New York City](https://www.nyscadv.org/find-help/program-directory.html). Here is a link to a program that could help you take the first steps, they are called [Safe Horizon](https://www.safehorizon.org/our-services/safe-place-to-stay/). Browse in incognito mode on Google to make your searches private, or be sure to delete your browsing history or use a computer at the library.

Please, let me emphasize, **this is a life or death situation**.

Strangulation is a [red flag for homicide](https://www.policyforum.net/red-flag-homicide/). It is the [most lethal form of domestic violence](https://wherestheline.info/strangulation-the-most-lethal-form-of-domestic-violence/). I am quoting from [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2573025/) abstract when I say, "" Prior non-fatal strangulation was associated with greater than six-fold odds (OR 6.70, 95% CI 3.91–11.49) of becoming an attempted homicide, and over seven-fold odds (OR 7.48, 95% CI 4.53–12.35) of becoming a completed homicide."" **If your partner has strangled you in the past, this is a clear, well-documented, well-researched predictor that he will kill you.**

Get out. Get out now.

I know how hard it will be because I have climbed the same uphill battle as you face. I left a pet behind to escape my abuser. I was homeless to escape my abuser. I lived at home to escape my abuser. I dropped out of college to escape my abuser. I changed phone numbers to escape my abuser. I abandoned social media to escape my abuser.

There are difficult, horrible sacrifices that you may have to make in order to survive. You may have to leave your pets. You may have to stay in a homeless shelter. You may have to live out of your car. You may lose friends. You may lose family. This is tragic. This is unfair.

Please, **tell everyone** about what is happening to you. Anyone and everyone should know that your partner is an abuser. Abusers need secrecy. They need to ""get away with it,"" to maintain control. Take that away from him, as much as you can.

No one wants you to be killed by this man. Explain it to them in those terms, and see what doors open up for you.

Nothing is so important that you cannot leave it in the past and start over. I promise you.

Yes, I could still cry over the pet I had to leave behind. It is a regret that I live with. But, I **live** with it. I would be dead if I had stayed because of the pet. If I had stayed and he murdered me and threw my body in a reservoir like he threatened to time and time again, that pet would be in the exact same situation as it is now.

**Every excuse becomes irrelevant if you are dead.** Remember that.

And do you really want to give this mother fucker the satisfaction?",1588791275,fpovbdh,t3_gektjv,/r/domesticviolence/comments/gektjv/need_help_escaping/fpovbdh/,5,domesticviolence,comment

I have been out of my abusive relationship for four years now and I can look back at all of the things I tried to rationalize now and know his actions did not deserve me excusing them. Sexual abuse in a relationship can be even more difficult to stop rationalizing (just in my opinion) because of the stigma that it can’t be sexual assault if it’s with your partner. People still push the narrative that rape only happens when women jog alone at night and a stranger attacks them from the bushes. Know that your feelings and experiences are very real and as hard as it may seem, you have the strength within you to leave. It’s great that you have been keeping tabs on different resources available to you, now is the time to create a plan to leave. Make sure you have people who can help keep you safe when the day comes for you to physically remove yourself from the relationship.

20317,unknown-reflection,t2_6dwh4pnx,"Thank you so much for your encouraging words of support.  The shame, guilt, and confusion that I have felt after each episode are so intense, I guess it's just been easier to bury it rather than face it.  But I don't want to have to keep digging; the further I dig to bury it the farther I am from even recognizing myself anymore.  

The sexual abuse has been the worst mind-fuck of them all.  How does a strong, confident woman not report their partner the first time she wakes up in the morning to find her bra unhooked and underwear around her ankles, with ""I got bored and wanted to make something out of the night after you passed out early,"" as the explanation.  I remember having a strong physiological response to this: my blood ran cold and I started to tremble and get tunnel vision.  But instead of leaving immediately and calling the police, I rationalized to the *extreme* to avoid having to face the idea that my partner had raped me.  It's happened a few times, to some degree.  Also using manipulation, coercion, sulking, or rage to get me to sleep with him; it's probably safe to say that 75% of our sexual encounters over the years have required a concession on my part, because if I just let him have sex with me I can try to enjoy the rest of my day without the insidious sulking and potential temper tantrum.  

The psychological abuse has been harder to recognize because it's been more subtle than say, the blind rage episodes.  I'm very suspicious that it's there, though, because all of the literature indicates it is.  I need to stop questioning whether or not my concerns are legitimate, because they obviously are.  I don't trust myself anymore; I'm a shell of the person I used to be.

20318,FifiLeBean,t2_u9fjt,"I wrote blog posts as a way to document things, process them, and stash memories so I could forget them and move on (not meaning to forget them, but I have been surprised what I found on my blog in a small private blog community). 

I reached out to a Domestic Violence agency in town.

I checked out the only book on Domestic Violence at the library where I worked (not with my library card) even though it had the worst title, it ended up being the best book on the subject for me: Why Does He Do That? by Lundy Bancroft

I had a friend who i would call when my then husband would say horrible things to me. She finally told me, ""that's verbal abuse"". I didn't fully realize it for some time. 

I had a lot of excuses and reasons for his behavior: a lot of them started with ""he's young and doesn't have much experience in life"" but after 11 years, he didn't grow up at all, he didn't change at all, he only got worse. I had countless discussions with him where I explained things like how you must treat people with basic respect no matter what, and he never understood, really. He did a lot of pretending and was a very good actor. But the conversations like this kept happening because he just didn't learn. He pretended to! He would act so contrite, it was like a Hallmark movie. 

I finally realized that he was telling me the truth when he was enraged: it was the opposite of what I thought was happening. I kept thinking the real him was the nice guy, and the bad him with the anger problem was just him losing control and not knowing how to handle his frustration and anger in life. What I realized was that the bad him was the Real him, and that the nice guy was a very complicated acting scene. He wanted people to believe he was the nice guy, but he really was not. He was not Dr Jekyll, he was really Mr. Hyde (if you know that famous old story). This shocked the hell out of me. And in fact, I think friends don't even believe it because his nice guy act is pretty convincing to them.

I shared this with my domestic violence support group: Here's my Hallmark Movie summation of the relationship: ""He was not who he said he was."" 

To my surprise, all the members of the group said that was it, exactly.",1588810293,fppw3nk,t3_getvm9,/r/domesticviolence/comments/getvm9/how_did_you_begin_to_process_the_fact_that_you/fppw3nk/,2,domesticviolence,comment

Not going to the police the first time it happened, or never going at all, does not make you weak. Unfortunately we live in a society that does not treat survivors kindly, we are constantly re-victimized and doubted. I still remember very clearly the first time my ex raped me. It was shortly after we finished having consensual sex, and because of that I didn’t go to the police even though I was bruised from clear physical assault. I figured the cops would write it off as me overreacting or ask me if things just maybe got a little rough. I constantly doubted myself, and to some degree still do. Coercion is rape.

20328,consider-thecoconut,t2_24058slq,"I remember when I began to really come to terms with the fact I was in an abusive relationship...it was extremely difficult but once I began to I could no longer tolerate being around him at all. 

For me what it was was another violent episode that just triggered all the other ones and like a loop I just realized how many times he had lost his temper and gotten physically with me over the years. He never punched me or anything but would frequently destroy and throw objects, corner me, scream in me, restrain me, grab me,shake me, throw me around.. 

What helped lift the veil though was I looked at an argument we were having, the last one where he put his hands on me..through the perspective of a child. I thought how would I feel or what would I be doing this if we had a baby sleeping in the other room right now and like a 4 year old little girl or boy watching him treat me like this. And I realized in that context, this was domestic violence I was experiencing. It took putting me in a family perspective instead of just two ""young people"" in a relationship to realize. 

And once I saw the relationship for what it was I knew I HAD to get out. I couldn't tolerate it.

But it's a confusing time for me. Because I was with him for 4 years and had two kids with him. So obviously I loved him with every part of me and I put up with a lot of bad behaviour. From him partying all the time and leaving me to parent both kids on my own. From getting caught on tinder. To emotional and physical abuse and threats of killing me.

And minimizing is a symptom of trauma. If there’s sexual abuse, there’s no question you’re being emotionally abused, it’s the most consistent, covert kind and hardest to reconcile. You always think worst things have happened to people but the point is, something bad is in fact happening to you. 

What ultimately helped me was I gave myself permission to be truly honest about the relationship. With myself and others. I tried to speak up when things bothered me and kept a mental tally of everytime he made me feel like shit or gaslighted me. Lost track pretty quickly once I did that and in a way, it provided the validation I needed to do what It took to leave. It’s hard no matter what. I still struggle, but everytime someone shares, it validates us all so thank you for coming forward. I relate to a lot of what you say on this thread and know at this point you’ve  experienced abuse and it was real. It’s also not your fault for what happened.

I recently made a conplete list of the things I would need, and obstacles I'd need to overcome. It was exhausting. Material objects, transportation, stable income, space for my stuff, social support, therapy, what to do with the cats... it went on and on. 

And then I wrote out steps. How can I get closer to each necessity, and how can I let go of things that are not necessities? It is an enormous, daunting, overwhelming list, but it's there. The timeline is laid out. And every single day, I try to take at least one step that will get me closer. 

The other day I wrote out what a day in my new life would be like. Waking up without having to instantly be on edge, being able to leave my knitting out without being belittled like a child, not flinching at every sound. Being able to eat breakfast while I look in peaceful silence out the window. Being able to enjoy my hobbies to my heart's content. Having the freedom to just let go, breathe, make my home cozy and mine, to have the space and calmness I need to allow joy in. To be able to walk in the door and not have to judge the mood in the air or listen for the emotions behind the footsteps first thing in the morning, to not be on high alert when I hear a car pull in...

There are more specific details in my day in the life that energize and excite me, and I read it every day to give me the inspiration to make it happen. I haven't felt hope and joy like this in a long, long time.

20368,tittychittybangbang,t2_640zcgrc,"Honestly your second paragraph really hit me there. I feel like I could have written this myself! It’s horrifying when you realise what’s actually happening, but worse still you hate yourself because you feel you’ve *allowed* it to happen, I’d often wake up as you did, underwear removed or pulled down, a regular was waking up to have him tell me he’d assaulted me in the night and wiped what was left of *himself* on my face or thighs. It got to the point where I couldn’t bear to undress if he was home, which meant showers and baths as well, and if I heard the key in the door I would literally RUN through the flat to make sure I was dressed and covered; no skirts or dresses because I didn’t wanna make it easy for him at least.

Everything you’re feeling now is valid, allow yourself to cry if you need to, but if you’re anything like me the tears will come when they’re ready. I’m with someone new now and honestly sometimes the way he treats me is pure and kind I cry, because I can’t believe how different he is to my ex, right down to respecting my boundaries, even though I still struggle to be intimate sometimes. 

You deserve so much more than this, you deserve to feel safe and loved and respected. You are more powerful than you know, it doesn’t feel like it just yet but this is the beginning of an incredible journey. You will change, you can’t fight that, it’s only natural with what you’ve experienced, but the growth is immeasurable. You have actually already done the hardest part, which in my opinion is recognising the abuse and then accepting it. Don’t worry if you’re not all the way there with the acceptance yet, again this is something that may take time, but believe me when I say there is no greater gift than absolute clarity.

I wish you all the best in your journey, I hope you find your way through all of this, the only way is up.",1588860530,fprrcl2,t1_fpptzur,/r/domesticviolence/comments/getvm9/how_did_you_begin_to_process_the_fact_that_you/fprrcl2/,1,domesticviolence,comment
20369,mstrashpie,t2_sz74x,"I took his comment like this. If I keep making baseless accusations that I believe he is abusive, our relationship will become toxic, even to the point beyond repair. He may have meant that he would hit me, or he may just become abusive, or he thinks that I would become abusive by constant accusations. I didn’t get clarification because I didn’t really think he was threatening me. He reassured me that it never crossed his mind to hit me in that moment. And again, based on factual evidence of him never touching me in an aggressive manner in the 4 years we’ve been together, I don’t really have logical basis that it could turn aggressive. 

The truth is I have some bouts of OCD. And no one can assuage my fears because it’s true, one day he may not be able to control himself and if that happens, it’s not the end of the world.

20803,cf1985,t2_2w6zp7c4,"Hang in there—this is the ultimate test of your strength and focus on rebuilding yourself and your life. I left my husband 8 months ago when I awoke to him trying to strangle me to death. Looking back, there was subtle emotional abuse before his drug use and mental illness finally pushes things over the edge into physical violence. After a few months of him threatening, begging, and harassing me to come back to him—he moved in with someone and jumped right into love bombing and lying. He apparently learned that target younger women makes the process even easier. At first, I was sad, angry, and shamefully—jealous at the idea that maybe he’d be a different person for her after what we went through. Now I see that he’s still who he is at the core, he just needs to fool her into giving him validation and value that he can’t give himself. He’s continued to contact me and beg me to fix things, while in a relationship with her. It’s felt amazing to deny him over and over again, even though it’s hard and it hurts. Come August, my divorce should be finally and I’m hoping that all my focus on my career will leave me ready to rebuild other parts of me. YOU CAN HAVE THE SAME. You could earn her, but it won’t matter. He’s already set the stage to make you appear crazy, like a liar, and potentially the abuser. My ex did the same-even got her to attend the sentencing hearing with him apparently. Trust me, the sting of missing the love bombing phase will end. I’ve been in therapy for 8 months, and one of the most helpful things I’ve done is write the following in a note in my phone: things he’d done to me, things I’ve missed out on, things I want for myself. When I’m feeling low or like I want to go back, I read those lists to remind myself that the sunshine and rainbows were rare and not real. Lean on supports, find new hobbies, have adventures, and most of all keep your head up because leaving abuse is not missing out on love.

20815,Patagonian_Puma,t2_65glg99u,"Hi  
Sorry for the walltext and for using google translator :P  
It is a complicated situation 

There are thousands of variables. 

We could spend all day talking about what you could have done, but you also have to understand that when a person grows up, he has to take charge of his life.

It is not your fault, you put all of yourself to try to help her and she did not accept your help. 

Based on my little knowledge of the subject (i got 20yo) and because I am in a similar situation with my mother, when you find yourself in similar situations: 

\-It is likely that she is in a relationship with a psychopath or similar. That means that she may be very emotionally manipulated, with things like ""Sorry, it won't happen again"", ""I'm going to change"", etc. 

\-Go step by step. Yes, it is an emergency situation, but in emergency situations you do not have to panic, say directly ""You have to get out of there !!"", without taking into account that she is very attached to him, that she believed all her lies (I'm going to change, etc.) and chances are she won't take your help. It is best to move step by step, it is important to listen, ask how she feels and have empathy for the other. 

\-Tell him that you will always be there when he needs you or to give him support throughout this process. 

\-Try to convince him to ask for help or go to a psychologist or even ask yourself for help from a psychologist to handle the situation. I don't know how things are where you live, but here in my country, Argentina, saying to someone ""go to the psychologist"" is like saying, you're crazy. Therefore, trying to find a way to convince, with experiences of your own or of people close to you, to explain how it is to go to therapy or have gone through situations of violence, may encourage her to seek help.

You did a lot and yes, it is very difficult to be in these situations.

Later I would like to tell my situation here but summarizing my case:  
 \- Violent father, he hit my mother continuously during the first 5 years of living together.  
 \-My mom got tired of the situation and made a complaint.  
 \-It was ignored  
 \-Physical violence was not repeated, according to my mother, because he is afraid of losing his job, but sustained psychological violence (meaningless discussions, etc.) has remained until now.  
 \-2 of my 3 sisters left home at the first opportunity  
 \-We all end up with some  psychological problem  
 \-My mother has a certain attachment to him and yes, she believes him when he says that he is going to change and no, he never changes.  
 \-After almost 30 years of this relationship, now I am trying to help her out of that situation.  
 \-This story will continue...

I also blame myself for not asking a psychologist for help first to guide me through this situation. We do what we can with what we have. Don't bear the blame.

Cheers!

20818,blissandblossom,t2_69bdbg6k,"Hi there, I have to say, after reading the whole post, this entirely reminds me of my ex. Each event was very similar...the immaturity, the never taking responsibility for his actions, the arguments over doing chores and acting like he never said he would do them, the hyperfocusness on things he cared about (but apparently not hyperfocus on learning how to do well in a relationship), the kindness and generosity to others, and the small events which eventually led to medium events which ultimately led to big events that were so all consuming, toxic, and you not knowing where you begin and he ends. 

All that to say, I got so caught up in the codependency, I justified my small events as that, small events...not realizing, I just allowed for boundaries to be redrawn of what I was allowing him to get away with. I can't tell you how many times I tried to communicate with my ex about these issues, about wanting us to make it work because I wanted him to be my forever, and of course, him not taking my caution into consideration nor owning up to his side. 

I really did believe that when small events happened, I had it under control, that he wouldn't restrain me again or yell at me, or belittle me. And after 3 years of working through it, we were good. Until one random night, he lost it. It was as if all our hard work went out the window. He yelled, he belittled, and he abused badly. 

When I reflect on my own experience, I lost focus of who I was and what I was willing to allow. Whether my ex knew it or not, he was continuously entitling himself to more and more power over me. Don't get me wrong, when we were good, there was so much love and joy, but for some reason, I could not shake that something was not right with our relationship. I found myself randomly crying over love songs, obsessively wondering when were we going to get into another argument, and always thinking about what else I could do to prove how much I loved him and wanted it to work. Relationships are not easy, but they shouldn't allow for power trips, irresponsibility, or physical pain. They require mutual support, consistency, accountability, and growth. I hope my own personal reflection helps, and feel free to DM if need be!",1588729106,fpmau0n,t3_ge4itm,/r/domesticviolence/comments/ge4itm/mild_case/fpmau0n/,2,domesticviolence,comment

20821,cf1985,t2_2w6zp7c4,"Where do I begin. 

1.) DV situations in which someone has been strangled increase the likelihood of the victim being killed by 10 TIMES.

2.) DV has patterns of escalation. I would be shocked to learn of a car where someone goes right into strangulation behavior. Just because your brother doesn’t have a record doesn’t mean he doesn’t have a pattern of abusing partners. Especially when you consider the low report rates caused by fear of retaliation and trauma bonds.

3. There is never a guarantee that someone WON’T kill you. Ever. I don’t care how much you think they love you, the promises they make—doesn’t matter. Love is not abusive.
 
4. He knows he’s being abusive and he isn’t sorry. Sorry isn’t a pattern and someone who cares about you wouldn’t even hurt you once. Period.

5. Get counseling and make a plan. An experienced therapist can help you make a plan, find resources, and get the fuck out of there alive while you can. Once you’re out, explore the warning signs and red flags that point to abusive relationships. Abusers target people with certain personality types and ways of being. Therapy will help you to protect yourself and become stronger as a person on your own.

6. Be single and stay that way for awhile. While you’re never at fault for being abused, there are behaviors that place you more at risk of finding yourself in abusive relationships. Learn to set healthy boundaries and find yourself again. It takes time and that’s okay.  It may also be beneficial to explore the topic of codependency. It’s common for people who struggle with codependency to find themselves in back to back relationships that are unhealthy and less than they deserve. 

7. Whatever you do, get out. The stories on the news are real. Those women and men never thought they’d be killed by their partners either. It can happen and it does. I narrowly escaped a similar fate 8 months ago. Lean on your supports and do anything you can to get out. 

Best of luck to you. You don’t deserve what is happening to you, no matter what he tells you. You didn’t push him to this level of violence. He chose to control, threaten, assault, and belittle you. He chose to do this when he knows what you’ve been through and continues to hurt you, over and over again. You deserve a life with so much more.❤️",1588731240,fpmed9c,t3_ge8ws4,/r/domesticviolence/comments/ge8ws4/i_think_im_in_denial/fpmed9c/,2,domesticviolence,comment

That might help stop the fighting and give you guys a healthier way to cope with your situation. 
That being said, if you feel in danger, you need to get to a safe place asap. Without help or counseling this is only going to get we worse- and counseling doesn't always help.

Could you call the domestic violence hotline to work out an escape plan? And connect with a dv organization in your area? I think you need advice from someone local on the lease. Some states allow you to break it for dv, the local organization has surely come across this issue before and will know what to do. 

I’m so sorry you hear police say demeaning things about dv at work. Please remember there are very high rates of dv among police officers and they are likely defending themselves and buddies by saying those things.  

Your work experience and personal experiences are really unique. Maybe in the future you will use that to help other women in dv.  After moving you could look for another job where you feel more comfortable at work. 

Therapy might help you learn to better identify men who have abusive tendencies and not fall for them again.

20826,justpeachy7777,t2_259yfr3,"I really feel for you because I went through something similar with my ex husband. We were together for eight years, married 3, and he was not abusive until the last one or two. And it was very subtle at first. 

Your situation has some red flags imo- he denies touching/hurting you and is quick to flip the blame on you instigating it.  

I suggest you don’t have kids or have any more with him while this is up in the air. 

I read Lundy Bancroft’s Why Does He Do That? to decide what was abusive and if I should leave. Ultimately I realized things were escalating (verbally threatening, physically he had started shoving me but didn’t hit me, etc.) 

The best advice is go with your gut. It sounds silly, but your post reads like you truly fear he will snap one day. There are men that do. No man or relationship is worth dying for. I would rather regret a divorce (I don’t) than be dead.

Couples therapy isn’t recommended for dv. But maybe he will attend individual therapy. He sounds very stressed. There is NO excuse for dv, and him denying and blaming things on you is a huge red flag. Before I divorced my ex I thought about just separating from him and having my own place for a year so he could work on himself. But things escalated and he wasn’t willing to do that, and I was too afraid of him anyway.

20829,memory193,t2_5gey9crr,"This sounds extremely similar to my experience. It started out with emotional abuse, where I was at fault if I felt any emotion other than happiness. He would also demean me, calling me a child and making negative comments about my appearance. He yelled a lot. It took many, MANY long conversations that occurred over many months for him to stop getting mad at me every time I expressed any opinion or emotion that he didn't agree with and for him to stop yelling at me (for the most part). After he ""changed"" I felt so free being able to express myself and be honest about my thoughts and opinions; I no longer felt like I was walking on eggshells. Not even a month later, though, the physical abuse ramped up. I think in my case my partner needed to maintain his control over me, and if it wasn't going to be through emotional abuse, he was going to use physical abuse as the next outlet. I wonder if your partner is doing the same thing.

With that being said, I also realized that even while the emotional abuse was going strong, the physical abuse was still there. It just started off so small that I didn't recognize it for what it was. Restraining me and grabbing my wrists were the first instances. I thought he would never hit me either but that eventually escalated into choking and punching. Every time it happened he would apologize afterwards, but claim he didn't remember doing it.

Funny enough, he also promised to read a book for me. He made a big show out of ordering it with prime shipping but he never even opened it.",1588737470,fpmo628,t3_ge4itm,/r/domesticviolence/comments/ge4itm/mild_case/fpmo628/,1,domesticviolence,comment
20830,SaltyWiring,t2_4v3nmm0s,"I think it's perfectly normal to feel the way you do. Plus, it's a wonky situation with Quarantine right now. It kind of exacerbates those feelings. Reading through your posts, I don't think there's a right or wrong on reaching out. They're in a honeymoon phase and would she listen? Would you have listened? I wouldn't have with my former abuser. People are complex, maybe she would, maybe not. Is it healthy for you to do so? 

I often thought I wouldn't be able to handle my abuser being with another woman. But then hey wait, he cheated so I all ready have. I got through it with that mentality and focusing on moving my own life forward.

I know that's easier said than done. It took me about a year of processing what happened before I was ready to start being productive and making new friends. Quarantine makes it tough as well. I would maybe look into a hobby or activity that you love or have always wanted to try. It would be your own, and maybe make some new friends in said hobby. I know this advice may not work for everyone but that is what I did to cope in a healthier way. I'd also maybe speak with a counselor on how to process this and why it's affecting you so deeply.

Due to the police reports, despite me not pressing charges because he did not submit his house key, the level of abuse I sustained has been considered high risk from the neighbours reports alone. Who knew they would ever save my life?? Because I this I have have my locks changed and restraints placed on my door. 
In my weaker moments, I rewatch recordings of him abusing me. Everytime he triggered, I recorded his outbursts on my phone. He knew I did this, I would send him the video once he was sober and plead with him to realise the pain he caused, both physically and emotionally. As I say, it’s early days but when I have felt weak and lonely, I’ve listened to the way he spoke and my cries each time he hit me. 
The turning point, was not my friends and neighbours admitting they heard the abuse, it was the words of my dad ‘ any longer he will take it too far and kill you’ I knew this, but hearing it from an amazing man I love and respect, the fear in his voice, really hit home. 
He will not be invited back this time, I know my neighbours are on alert and listening out for my safety.

Feeling strongly or losing your head are not excuses. But I suppose you know that already, since you’re here. Thank you, btw, for coming here. =]

Have you reached out to your local shelter? I was pleasantly surprised by how many resources are available, even online.

At the risk of scaring you further....what concerns me most is how you described him choking you. Strangulation is VERY SERIOUS and the statistics for it very clearly suggest that it will eventually lead to homicide. 

I implore you to check out a book Why Does He Do That? You can borrow a digital copy from the local library using  
Overdrive, so he won’t even know. It may help you better recognize his patterns and understand a bit of why you feel so crazy and at fault (spoiler alert, it’s because you are being manipulated). I suggest that you do NOT talk to him about how you are reading this, or even about how you think he is abusing you. Y’all are WAY past that point, and the more information you give him about how you feel and what you think the easier it will be for him to talk himself out of trouble with you.

If I'm being completely honest, I feel like the relationships you get in after going through an abusive one, are almost harder. You have to relearn all your ideas of love. I'm now in a healthy relationship, and the best thing I can say is to trust yourself and know you're worth. Take it easy and slow and ease your way into dating. Set boundaries with your new partner! It's so important to think of the boundaries you want set before getting into a relationship. That was what helped me out the most. I let my boyfriend know about the experiences I've had in my past, and I told him the boundaries I had set for myself. I used to HATE the idea of having to go through the whole dating scene again, but you shouldn't let the POS ex ruin, your chance at a healthy relationship for your future.

I would get a couple of things: a book in which you can write down everything she's done to you. The second thing is a recording device (check on your laws in your area for recording personal conversations before using). So if she's said that if you leave she'll try and bring you down, you might be able to record it and keep as evidence. As well as those threats she's made against you.

As for getting yourself out of there, not sure if after you've shown all the evidence you've got against her to the police, see if one of them will come back with you to her place, so they can be there to ensure she doesn't carry out her threat to kill you, so you're able to get your stuff and leave.

21809,Notyourtarget1224,t2_4igxhrhs,"Be very careful about treating her like a child. As hard as it is, it is a choice she had to make to leave and it is a choice she will have to continue making to not return. Too much pushing one way could very well backfire. 

Abusers take EVERYTHING from their victims. They make them feel small and like a helpless child. You have to find this delicate balance between supporting her but also giving her room to breathe. It sounds like you’re trying very hard to accomplish this.

Instead of hiding her keys, I would let her know you’re holding onto them. I’d be honest about why you’re holding onto them (scared she’ll go back in a momentary lapse of judgement) and that if she really needs them for any reason, you’ll happily give them back but you want to talk about it first. 

In all honesty, If she’s determined enough to go back, missing keys will not stop her. It will hopefully help her think through her actions fully instead of impulsively going back but it won’t stop her. 

You as the family just have to be very careful about how you show your love and concern. If it can be perceived as controlling, it’s something that the tactic in handling it needs to be rethought. There are ways to help her but until you’ve survived an abuser who’s that controlling, you have no idea how small a victim feels. How much that survivor needs reminding that being controlled isn’t the norm. That they can make their own choices and it’s ok, they’re not going to face backlash from friends and family who love them for the choices they make. I believe really tasting the freedom is such an important step in healing and moving forward. Instead of suggesting she should do things, ask her if she wants help doing them. If she says no, back off of it for awhile. 

Best of luck to you both. You’re an amazing soul for being so supportive and helpful to her. 💜",1588538719,fpe1wms,t3_gcpc60,/r/domesticviolence/comments/gcpc60/she_has_ran_away/fpe1wms/,1,domesticviolence,comment

If you ever start to feel comfortable enough that they loss control of you, they will up the manipulation. 

I'll give you an example: If you were to emotionally detach inorder to survive the emotional abuse, she might escalate to physically. Once she has gotten physical with you, you'll have to defend yourself in some form. Once you have had to touch her to defend yourself, she will say you are the one that abuses her and threaten to charge you if you leave or make her unhappy. 

Try to find somewhere else to live, maybe go to the police and start a paper trail to cover yourself, moved anything you care about without her noticing, leave and never look back.

I have started the divorce process and didn’t initially want to work with the DA and be responsible for his charges. I will tell you three months out, I am so glad he will have a record and lose his guns. I was with him for 13 years. I have had dreams about him coming home and I hate that they make me happy for a moment. I also was so lonely the first month. It’s hard, you’re healing and it’s not going to be overnight. I did spend the last two years planning my escape and thought I was over him. I have put myself in trauma counseling and this is normal to feel. They are right when they tell you not to isolate.

As I say with all domestic violence cases, depending your law for recording conversations etc, whether or no you need the other person's permission to record it. Why ? Because if he's making any form of threats to her, whether under the influence or no, it could be used in evidence.

See if you can meet up with her one time, and then take her down to the police station, and report the abuse from there.",1588558444,fpezog0,t3_gd2ip8,/r/domesticviolence/comments/gd2ip8/my_24f_dad_46_has_always_been_abusive_to_me_my/fpezog0/,1,domesticviolence,comment

21831,fuzziemuffin,t2_7lawn,"It might be a good idea to get the Restraining Order started before she knows what’s going on. That way you’re on your way to being protected legally before she has a chance to spin it, say your the abuser and get one against you (just to ruin your rep and mess with you if she’s not scared). 
Gender roles reversed, but my best friend was attacked by her ex partner, and she fought back, called the cops, and they arrested HER. Since then her abuser likes to threaten her with an RO and other similar threats. She, without his knowledge, has been able to contact a lawyer, and has started the RO process against him, applied for full custody of their kids, and yesterday while he was working, I helped her move out. It was absolutely necessary to blindside him, and it might be for you with your abuser. It’s taken a long time to get out from under him, but we took it one day at a time and now she has a chance.

I’m sorry your stuck there, but it may be better to just play amicable, even as far as pretend everything is good, just to keep the peace. Maybe start working on an escape plan for when restrictions are lifted. Get some of your important docs and stuff together when she’s not paying attention and hide them. Research housing opportunities, maybe talk to someone about starting a restraining order so she can’t even try to get at you after. Have a friend or family member in the loop, having an ally is incredibly helpful with these situations. If you need to talk to anyone on the phone and can’t do it in front of her, go to the store or something (maybe even ask if she would like something while you’re out?).

My friend is a good person, but I do think that he might have bought in to her public persona. I mean, I did once. 

I don't see them alone very often, and especially not these days, so it's hard to really have a conversation like that. I had to wait until my wife was definitely going to be out all day. Of course now I've withdrawn from local people, even before the virus, so I just assume I've been talked about already.

When i leave, I will leave the town too. I will miss my friends obviously, so I guess I'm okay with it in the end. I think I put them in a rough position since they know both of us so well.

I started to become more interested in the relational side of things,while being completely in denial about the emotionally abusive aspects of my own relationship. Things came to a head after I graduated with my MA in psychology and began a clinical PhD program when I was living with my ex and fighting all the time. The pressure of the PhD, the expenses,trying to work at the same time, and my ex just got to me and overwhelmed me. I dropped out and was home a lot just working part time. And he started becoming more abusive and aggressive and edging into physical abuse, again. He had done that the year prior when I was working on applications and unemployed. 

Finally I realized it had happened to me, I was in an abusive relationship and it was so hard to process and come to terms with and I couldnt believe I had been in denial so long.

So I guess I had that ""isolation of affect"" too. I think also I had just been so busy in school and work saw him so little for years, that's what made it hard to realize.

Its hard sometimes when you think you're past that stuff and can work on it objectively to realize you're not",1588442616,fpa7wws,t3_gc61u9,/r/domesticviolence/comments/gc61u9/i_just_completely_a_research_paper_on_intimate/fpa7wws/,1,domesticviolence,comment
22305,Bettyourlife,t2_52dgcz2f,"I'm so sorry that you're  stuck in this situation.  The best thing to do when planning to leave an abusive person to keep all plans to yourself.  Much better to plan in secret and when you're sure the coast is clear make your move and then inform the abusive person after the fact.

Do you have any youth crisis centers, school counselors, etc that might be able to advise you?  There are support avenues in place out there, but sometimes you have to search for them.  They can help you with finding a place to stay, getting a job, finishing school etc.  You might have to reach out to a number of people to assemble the whole package though.

If you can, secretly record your Mom's behaviors that way you'll have proof of why you want to leave and why it is unhealthy for you to stay.  There are lots of YT vids that explain why people abuse their kids and how it starts to feel like you're helpless and to blame for it all.  Richard Grannon and Little Shaman are two that come to mind.  

Take good care of yourself as much as possible.  Try to keep to a schedule, eat as well as you can manage, and exercise even if it's just online workouts.  Again do not reveal any of your successes to your mom, just downplay them as nothing.  Abusive people are dependent on those they abuse and get nervous when they sense their target getting stronger.

Good luck, hope a couple of those ideas help.  Don't forget to look up crisis hotlines as well.  There are good people out there that want to help.  You have to reach out there and start connecting.  My hunch is that you have very good instincts that's why you're hesitating to leave before you have your ducks in a row.

Good luck, sending lots of (((hugs))))",1588445465,fpacrfd,t1_fp8vrz6,/r/domesticviolence/comments/gb0m64/is_it_rare_that_i_am_a_guy_who_is_abused_by_my_mom/fpacrfd/,1,domesticviolence,comment

Regardless of whether you had to stop due to the abuse, you have achieved so much, and I really hope you’re proud of yourself. 

Sometimes coming out of denial can be the hardest part. It’s a scary and unknown time, and it feels like your whole life has been flipped upside down. The power of the brain, and it’s ability for denial, is kind of amazing. In some ways, it’s definitely a defence mechanism. Though I am so glad you came out of that denial and realised the situation you were in - even if it had a negative impact on your studies.

That research area would have been incredibly interesting, given the known links between childhood abuse/witnessing DV and finding yourself a victim. I also experienced childhood trauma, but only realised within the last year or so. But even before this realisation, and before I found myself in an abusive relationship, I’ve *always* been interested in trauma. Even though I’m no longer doing formal prolonged exposure therapy, I’ve continued testing the waters and trying to make progress - I’m currently doing a child abuse elective, and am hoping to be accepting into doing a psychology of trauma elective.

It might be a good idea to talk with people who work with victims of domestic violence to ask about ways you can keep yourself hidden  and safely move yourself and your belongings to your new home. 

When I left my abuser, I moved to a city almost 4 hours away from him, rented a house from my cousin so that I could put everything in my cousin’s name, from the electric bill to my new phone service. I renewed my driver’s license using the address of the ex, and had all of my mail forwarded. I even used a different address for my bank account rather than use my current address. I thought I did everything possible to keep myself hidden. Six months of feeling safe, and then he shows up at my new residence and tries to steal my dogs from my back yard when I let them out to use the bathroom. I had no idea how he found me! Until I was told his mother paid the white pages website to get information about me, and somehow the white pages had my current address. 

Now, I wish I had spoken to people who help people disappear BEFORE I moved. Not only could they have helped me know what to do to keep myself hidden, but they have helped me find free lawyers to help me afford the divorce, they helped me find affordable counseling, they have provided a court advocate who helps me understand the process of getting a protection from abuse order, and they have helped me think of safety precautions I would have never thought of on my own.",1588496632,fpcdoir,t3_gchi60,/r/domesticviolence/comments/gchi60/because_of_covid19_ill_finally_be_financially/fpcdoir/,1,domesticviolence,comment

22342,spaghetti4liiiiiiife,t2_2vzt2t57,"I’m so happy for you, it’s wonderful that you have not only the courage but the ability financially to get out! Years ago, I was preparing to leave my abuser but I was terrified of being tracked down. I was more afraid of what would happen after I left him. I consulted a friend who was a lawyer and had represented several women who’d been abused by their spouses. I’d like to share with you what she told me. 

We are so connected now through social media that it’s nearly impossible to stay hidden unless you just completely go off grid. The best thing you can do to protect yourself is get a Judge involved. You’ll want to contact the police department in your city to file for a Protective Order. Once you file you should receive a notice about your hearing, typically it will be within 2 weeks from the date you filed. When you go before the Judge you’ll need to be able to prove that you believe you are in real danger because of this person, and your argument needs to be extremely convincing. Some things you should be prepared to show the judge are: Police reports that you have filed against him (if you have any. A lot of women don’t file reports and judges know this), time/date/detailed account of incidents, photos of injuries or property damage he has caused, threatening texts or voicemails, letters from anyone who have personally witnessed his abusive behavior. If you don’t have some of these things it’s not the end of the world, just be very convincing that you are in fear for your safety. 

When the judge grants the order, make several copies of it. One for the car, one at home, one for your desk at work, etc. You don’t go anywhere without a copy on your person. Your ex will be notified of the order and the restrictions (no contact, can’t come within X feet of you, etc). If he ignores the order and tries to bother you, you call the police and he goes to jail. 

If for some reason the judge is not convinced and the order is not granted, also not the end of the world. You may be able to file for a Civil Harassment Order. It’s not as much protection, but it is protection. The paperwork will be on file with the county clerk regardless of whether or not it was granted. So let’s say, God forbid, something happens like he shows up at your house uninvited. You call the police and file a report against him for harassing you. Now you have a protective order not granted on file AND a police report against him after the fact. At that point you are almost guaranteed a Protective Order. 

Hope this helped.",1588512916,fpcucyh,t3_gchi60,/r/domesticviolence/comments/gchi60/because_of_covid19_ill_finally_be_financially/fpcucyh/,1,domesticviolence,comment

22345,human1127,t2_450pzzx0,"1. Trade her car in ASAP... Find something plain, that does not stand out. For extra protection, window tint will help to keep others from seeing inside or being able to identify who’s car it is immediately. Another suggestion is to purchase something very different than what she would normally buy. (She normally drives sports cars, buy a family or economy car) 
2. Change all PlayStation usernames, emails and any other online tags. Absolutely no contact is best. 
3. Change her phone number and to even take it a step further, change any and all phone numbers he might know. If he can’t get to her, he might try to contact her through other people or family members. 
4. “Hometown” is no longer her safe haven. She needs to break all contact with the town for at least a year and make her a life elsewhere. A few hours drive should be fine as long as there’s no way he can track her back down. All contact with family should be done through new numbers or have her use your phone.

She needs to be as far away as she can get for as long as possible.  Also, advice for you... sometimes after the trauma and the initial shock has worn off, people will sometimes forgive their abusers and go back. Be her support even after it seems she’s ok, let her vent, yell or whatever she needs to do to process the loss. She’s processing a lot right now. In addition to being physically hurt, she’s emotionally hurt and also grieving the loss of a relationship and future she had planned. My sister has been in an abusive relationship for years and she always goes back. I’m happy that your sister was able to escape.

My boyfriend blocked off the PlayStation and he began to call my sister nonstop at 3AM. She has 12 missed calls from him. I’m not sure if she answered. He has my mothers phone number because she has a business. We want her to change her number ASAP and will be telling her again. We are also trying to get her to transfer uni which is the 4 hour drive to hometown. He doesn’t know what uni I go to so it’s good. We are also gonna see to delete useless numbers that connect to him like mutual friends.

I’m glad she came to me. I spoke to several physicians I work with and one hit close to home. She was a victim and told me her story. She advised me of shelters near the area and people for her to talk to when she’s ready. My sister is young and I know she’s been seeings that he’s a pos and she can’t return to him. I even told her about her friend who recently passed away due to DV. I’ve been opening her eyes alongside her friend.

If he was inspired to change, he would - on his own, without help. If he wanted to find books on abuse and recovery, he could Google it. If he wanted to find a recovery group for men, he could Google it. If he wanted to seek out a therapist, he could Google it. He could make is own Reddit account and ask his own anonymous questions.   


He doesn't need your help. He really, truly does not. You are the LAST person that should be helping him through his ""recovery,"" and he is the last person who should be helping you through yours.  


This is an unhealthy relationship you two are indulging in and it will not end well for either of you. Please tell him you need to heal alone and as a result of his actions, you do not feel comfortable continuing a relationship with him and encourage him to seek help on his own and continue to discuss his feelings with a professional. Similarly, I suggest you continue to heal and process your experiences and feelings with a professional and not your abuser.  


I highly, highly recommend the book ""No Visible Bruises,"" by Rachel Louise Snyder. She is a reputable journalist who explores the recovery of abusers in prison in one section of this book. In it, she describes how seemingly enthusiastic, remorseful people enrolled in recovery programs for domestic violence still go on to abuse their victims and, tragically, kill them and their children.  


Please don't continue to put yourself in his line of fire. It is not your responsibility or your burden to ""save"" him.

If he really wanted to change, if he was really interested in learning how to deal with all the conflict in his life and becoming a better person: he’d be in therapy, not dumping his emotional needs on you, an ex he’s been abusive towards and is still taking advantage of. And I want to emphasize that to you here: *he is taking advantage of you*. Most people don’t hang around as emotional sounding boards or straight up emotional dumpsters for their exes, he’s *taking advantage* of the fact that you’re keeping a line open for him and *using you*.

He is a grown man perfectly capable of seeking out the resources and help he needs on his own, but gee, isn’t it so much nicer to have a woman on his hook to *do* things *for* him? Why would he ever grow up when he has so many folks to keep catering to him?

You are not a therapist and you should not act like one for him: you have your own stuff going on and are in no fashion obligated to continue catering to his emotions.

22805,spook1982,t2_6c9gt8nv,"I recognise your story, as being similar to my own. In 2018 my husband was arrested. The Domestic Abuse has gone on for a long time before the police were called. I thought I hid it well, but one night he pulled a carving knife out and threatened to kill me, and himself. My teenage daughter was in the house and she had the courage to ring the police. 
I pressed charges and for 7 months I waited for the trial. At the last minute I pulled out, didn’t turn up at court so the case was dropped. 
My husband had been in touch, despite the order preventing this and apologised, he had changed, he sought help, he loved me and it would never happen again. 
I believed him. I was struggling. I hadn’t confided with anyone what I was going through. Nobody knew the case was looming I thought I was holding it together. Social services were involved in my children, and one who clearly was not very good in their role treated me as though I was the guilty party, and threatened to ‘put a section in place that took my children from my care’ 
I was failing in my work role, I can see now it was due to the trauma and stress I felt.  Worried how I would cope financially. All of this played a part. But mostly, I believed him. I believed the promise of change and allowed him back into our lives. 
Fast forward to last week. 
The abuse had been going on since 3 months after he returned. I felt I was trapped. Who would believe me since I didn’t follow through last time? 
For almost two years, I was called a slag, accused if I even saw another person. He threw things at me, pushed me down a flight of stairs when I was on crutches, on New Year’s Day he woke with a hangover, I woke with painful bones and two black eyes. Funnily, this was the only time he sobbed and apologies. Perhaps seeing my broken face gave a real understanding? I always recorded his behaviour, I only ever wanted him to be able to hear what he said and did when he was drunk, he could never remember so, it never happened.  He knew I did this, I never lied to him. Only then, he started sending me messages asking why I hit him? As I lay in bed I could hear him making recordings and throwing things around begging me not to hit him!! It was crazy!! I thought, I’m trapped... who’s going to believe me now? I walked on egg shells and lived in fear for when he drank. I think it is only fair to say when he was sober he was charming. 
I told him many times, he was going to kill me. And, I believe he would. 
Only, last weekend, he drank and drank and drank some more. He lost himself and his public mask slipped. As I stood outside socially distancing and chatting to a few from the homes in our quiet cul de sac, he lunged outside, stating he was going going to stab and kill me and the others around me. A fight began, the police were called and despite being mortal drunk he drove away. 
I was no longer successfully hiding my story, he has opened that book for the whole neighbourhood. 
I have been identified at severe risk, deadlocks and new locks on my door. Panic alarms. More numbers than I can store in my phone book! 
I haven’t pressed charges. I can’t face the social service threats again.  But, it seems I didn’t need to. The police went to the neighbours as part of their general enquiry. They heard my cries, begging him not to hit me, pleading with him to believe me when I say I’m not having affairs, looking at other men, disrespecting him in anyway. Other neighbours heard his screaming and shouting. I was mortified. 
I won’t let him back. But, why do I feel such a fool. I’m hiding in my house, not because of him but because of the shame. 
He has rang me many times, I haven’t answered the calls. 
I don’t want to be a victim or a survivor. I just want to be me. I haven’t cried. I haven’t got angry. I can’t feel anything. I listened last night to the recordings if me begging and sobbing, pleading not to hit me. I felt nothing. 
That can’t be normal, now I fear I’m just damaged goods. 
Even then leaving doesn’t end the abuse. It just opens a whole new door.",1588362616,fp7219a,t3_gac0h3,/r/domesticviolence/comments/gac0h3/truly_free/fp7219a/,1,domesticviolence,comment

After escaping, I would say I felt numb for two or so months. I didn't really cry or feel any emotions. I was worried, when I was with him, I distanced myself from my emotions to survive and I felt I was stuck in the same pattern.

Then it hit me. I became very depressed and anxious. I could rarely sleep, had very vivid nightmares and became very paranoid. I cried almost every night, I felt like running back to him because how I was living was so unfamiliar - at least the abuse was predictable, I knew what was going to happen every day. Away from him, I felt lost and had no sense of direction, I didn't know what each day would bring.
I drank more than I'd like to admit, I had suicidal thoughts and I realised I was going through stages of grief. The previous numbness was partially denial, now came the lowest of the low. The months went on, I was terrified that I wouldn't get better, that the depression I felt wouldn't lift.

I don't know how it happened or when, I'd say around six months later, I started to change. It was gradual, I didn't really notice my progress at first. I stopped thinking about him less and less, the nightmares went from 7 nights a week to once a fortnight, I didn't get triggered as easily. I felt a weight lift and started to focus on myself, threw myself into work, and socialising. I embraced things I'd been forced away from for years and for the first time since I left, I truly was able to appreciate my current life. My anxiety became more controlled and I was smiling so much. My favourite thing to do is just sit in silence at night, knowing that I'm not going to have to deal with argument or a slap, that I can just be at peace.

Things aren't perfect. I still struggle so much, especially with my self confidence. I've found therapy, speaking out about what I've been through and even watching YouTube videos around narcissistic abuse/domestic violence has helped me so much.
I never thought I'd get to where I am now and feel how I do. In general, I have more good days than bad. I never deny or shy away from any negative emotions, if something triggers me, I do allow myself to cry and vent. I now drink for fun, not to cope. I'm learning to enjoy my own company and find who I am, which helps the feelings of inadequacy when I worry about entering new relationships, etc.
There's no time limit or perfect way to heal from what we've been through and truthfully, I don't think we'll ever be who we were before we met our abusers but I do think we can become a new version of ourselves that's just as happy.",1588373776,fp7n3w4,t1_fp7219a,/r/domesticviolence/comments/gac0h3/truly_free/fp7n3w4/,1,domesticviolence,comment

22813,PrincessShhhhh,t2_q416uxq,"This is called the Cycle of Abuse.  


Abusers will cool down with a rest period known as the Reconciliation where they demonstrate the qualities that you love about them, reminding you how good things can be, and giving you hope for the future. Then there is temporary Calm. Then there is the Escalation phase. This is when the string grows taut, but is not yet ready to snap. Finally, there is an Incident.  


To answer your question, yes. The abuse will escalate.  


What used to flush him with adrenaline will become a dull - numb. It will not be enough to pinch you, slam you against a wall, break something, scream at you. He will have to do more to feel in control.  


Right now, he is feeling out your boundaries. How much can he hurt you without consequences? What can he do to keep it a secret? Because know this - he doesn't love you. He never has.  


If he loved you, he wouldn't hurt you.  


But he does. He does because he loves feeling in control. In those moments, when he is hot with adrenaline, fighting you, he feels good. He feels the best he has ever felt. He is powerful. He is beyond the consequences of his actions. He is hurting you and getting away with it.   


After the sweat has dried and his breath returns to normal, he may feel regret. He may be apologetic. He may be horrified, surprised he could go so far - destroy so much, hurt you so bad. He can't handle the guilt, the consequences of his actions, so it becomes your fault, doesn't it?   


You made him do it. You provoked him. If you hadn't done this, if you hadn't done that, then he wouldn't have done those things. It wasn't really him - it was what you made him do, right? He isn't like this. You made him like this.  


Sound familiar?

Also, it's highly likely that him trying to contact you is considered witness tampering if he's being charged with felonies and you're his victim. Contact the DA's office. They probably have a victim's advocate assigned to you and they won't take that lightly. My situation was a bit different because I didn't bail him out and he didn't have any other way to get bail and he was contacting me from jail, but when the ADA assigned to my case found out he had been calling me, he left the room right away and shut that down immediately. They take that kind of thing seriously.

22839,100862233,t2_10wltl,"Thanks, I don't know what really to do, I am pretty scared and tired at home, when I am at work and when I am outside I pretend everything is fine, most people thought I am a ""happy"" outgoing person, but I always feel there is something hanging on my heart, I don't know how to describe it but it seems like a sense of dread all over me, I tried to play video games and I always tried to reach out to talk to people to keep me distracted from those feeling, but sometimes even those aren't enough to get rid of the feeling of dread, I don't know how to properly describe it. 

I told my mom before that I am plagued with suicidal thoughts and she just scoffs at me and telling me to quit being a baby and somehow I always have to take care of her feeling.  She always makes me feel like I am bad, that I am evil, in the past, I have confronted her multiple times about this,  she always tells me that she wishes she never had me or how much better off she would have been without me, she keeps acting like if I voluntarily wanted to be her son when I told her this she reacted by saying she never asked to be my mother too. I don't understand why she does this if she doesn't want to be a mother, to begin with!? I have learned a little bit about Feminism which talk about societal people seems to pressure women to be ""mothers"" and I can understand that, but she still made the choice of isolating herself and me from everyone she chose to screw up every relationship in her life, it's not my fault, I never asked for any of these, I never asked to cause her trouble, I didn't volunteer for this but she just doesn't understand how I feel, she just so dead set on painting me as the vilest bad guy whenever she got mad, and I have to apologize for causing her to be mad even though I never wanted to be anywhere near her anymore! 

I used to look up to my mom when I was little, I thought if I just say all the things she wants she would love me, I thought that she bought me all the video games, expensive toys so it makes up for all the horrible yelling and beating, I even told my teachers and other kids that it was okay, I defended my mother's action to everyone, I told everyone how nice and awesome my mom was, and I always tried to excuse her actions, but over the years she only made very little progress, now I feel so crushed, the weight is too much, I don't have a life, I can't go out and meet girls because I am caged between my work and home, my mom took all the money I make, and only give me 50 dollars a month, if I didn't make 1k she wouldn't even give me 50 dollars, she keeps saying it's to pay the rent but she has no jobs, she haven't worked in over 10 years and she is very easily offended, she takes her behavior outside so i don't even know she will get a job and keep it, i am so terrified because all my youth is now dedicated to my mom, when i see other people of my age going out having fun, starting their own life, some even married for a few years, i told myself that i will get out soon right? but nothing has improved no one in my family seems to take my worries to considerations. None of them want to make a meaningful help to help me become independent, they either scare me, guilt trips me, or a combination of both.

\^Did you read the entire post? I'm cultivating self love (hence celibacy). I suspect you haven't been a victim of intimate partner violence. I didn't admit it to myself when it was happening, I didn't tell people what he did to me until after I left him. Please don't try to give wisdom if you haven't suffered through it yourself. I get you're trying to help, but it's a little abrasive. This is a sensitive fucking topic, deeply personal, I have been in psychotherapy for 5 years and I still get triggered in the present from things he did to me in the past. Being loved is a trigger for me, in my next relationship after my abuser I fell in love again, and constantly got triggered. And then after that relationship ended, and I fell in love again, with a different person, I got triggered by love again. You don't ""just forget about it.""

At a certain point, I had to just understand that he truly did not care, was never going to be nice to me, was never going to stop hitting me, would never take accountability for his actions or stop lying. PTSD is a beast of another kind. Nothing felt right after leaving until almost a year out. You see it with such clarity now, but you also understand you can't make someone leave until they're absolutely ready- if they're not in immediate danger. The last beating was so bad, there was no time to make a plan or ease out of the relationship. I don't have children- so I didn't value anything above him or getting him ""help."" Which was me covering for him. It was a blatant nightmare that still seems surreal at times. And the lying and infidelity. Oh my God, how he tried to justify it all or deflect that behavior on me. I've always been the ""Good girl"" and it was so hurtful and insulting. Even going through absolute poverty was better than living in a brick ranch with his insanity. 

It's so funny what you won't tolerate now. I'm in a very new relationship. And I'm loving it, but I tried to go on a few dates or get to know a few guys before my current SO. As soon as there was behavior that was off, or I suspected a lie I completely dismissed them.  I had one guy try to hide his drinking problem, another one was in anesthesia and acted like I needed him and I had a price only he could afford it was so insulting- this was just a first date! Another guy lied about absolutely everything and acted like he was some sort of celebrity. And I wasn't mean, but I didn't ""ghost"" or beat around the bush. I called them out on it right away. It's opened my eyes to how adults (both men and women)  even in their 30's and 40's can act so absolutely immature. It was such a turn off I decided to quit trying and finish my degree.

 I met another engineer that had to work his way through school as his family couldn't afford to send him to college. I didn't have to be ashamed of my poverty at that time, and I could be firm and tell him I didn't want any help financially and he didn't push his position on me. It is the best feeling in the world to be honest and accepted. It's also an awesome feeling when your sense of humor comes back, and you don't have to be afraid to joke or laugh without offending your abuser for some ridiculous reason.

If you can, find a way to surreptitiously record your mom's violent abusive behavior, if for no other purpose to bolster your sanity that it's not you, but her that has the problem.  If might come in handy later if you want to get a TRO and cut contact, or need to have it in case of legal issue.

Your current situation is definitely abusive and you've made an important first step contacting DV support help and looking for solutions.  You'll need to find a pro bono attorney that understands what your former husband has done to you and help you begin the fight for custody.  I don't think the current situation that you're living in will help you in any way, but instead will only hurt you.  This man does not have your back and will not help prove you have a stable place for your kids.

Right now you need to find support. You can consider turning to online communities that might help such as ACOA adult children of alcoholics (also includes other dysfunctions) Recovery Dharma, a buddhist based recovery program, online yoga groups, meditation groups, etc.  Any type of help the DV support worker can offer you, would be great to start exploring.  The only way out of this type of situation is to take the best care of yourself as you are able and seek support from people who understand DV and who also understand your legal situation.

I can see now, it was dangerous. I said to him, many times he would kill me one day and not realise his actions until he had sobered up by the following morning. By which time, it would be too late. 
The cat is out of the bag. Despite me not prosecuting they deemed me ‘high risk’ purely on the neighbours statement. They heard his weekly threats to harm and kill, and me begging him to stop hurting me. As neighbours, we are not even close, but I feel now I owe them my life. 
We live in a quiet ‘well to do’ cul de sac (I think maybe a fairly apt description) everybody leading quiet, perfect lives. His outburst in pubic really shook that. 
Many times he abused me, I recorded it on my phone. He knew I did this, I would send him the recordings in the morning so those times he couldn’t remember, he knew what he did. 
The worst, of this year at least.. waking up New Year’s Day. My whole family celebrating what’s to come, I found myself making excuses because I was hiding black eyes and bruises. 
Almost 5 months later.. my eyes are wide open. I recognise him as nothing more than an abuser but, importantly I recognise myself as a strong, independent woman. 
For days, I have quietly listened to the recordings of the abuse. Finally I found my strength. 
I maybe embarrassed. But with new locks and devices in my doors courtesy of the police I am now safe and aware that he was never a man.. simply a wolf in sheep’s clothing.

My ex would smile and even laugh when being violent, I know what you mean by them taking pleasure in it. The first few times and rarely after, he would fake cry and apologise but the longer we were together, the less he tried to hide the enjoyment.

At the moment, I'm waiting on the court to decide whether they're going to accept my case against him. He would break my phones/laptops, so I never managed to keep photographic evidence and he always stopped the beatings before it required something like a hospital trip (he was very controlled in his abuse, if that makes sense)

23365,vish_sen,t2_5xun2qao,"Hello

Please reach out to me. I know it's hard. Abusers make us feel cut off and alone. We are often too ashamed to ask friends and family for help, which is exactly what the abuser wants.

If you can't afford a flight ticket or a place to stay, you have to reach out to your friends and family for the funds. You know deep in your heart that you must leave, but you feel that there are many reasons to stay. And as a surviver, I can tell you that 48 hours away from the situation will get you back on track. Those reasons will fade away to reveal the truth of what you went through. You must help your son, and you must help yourself. 

You are afraid for your life. That is no small regard. If you know even 2 friends back home and talk to your parents, I know they will transfer enough funds for you to plan a way to leave. If you can't convince yourself, then think of your son and how much trauma he might grow up with if you stay. You are a smart and capable young woman who can survive a man's beatdowns. Moving back home and finding a way to pay your parents and friends back is nothing. 

I let my boyfriend go out to walk his dog, and I threw out all his possessions and threatened to call the police and publicly shame him. There was far too much evidence for him to deny and abusers do not make public scenes. He had no choice but to leave. I planned the whole thing. And you need to plan the whole thing too. You absolutely cannot stay. You MUST leave. 

If you need to discuss an exit plan, I am here for you. Please reach out to me and let me know you're okay. 

Lots of love",1588321637,fp5a2eb,t3_gbd407,/r/domesticviolence/comments/gbd407/and_he_calls_me_the_abuser/fp5a2eb/,1,domesticviolence,comment

Ultimately I think you know that you need to leave. He is violent, manipulative, dangerous, and shows all the signs that he is going to kill you one day. I was married to someone like this and it only gets worse.

He sounds like he may have a personality disorder, btw - Borderline or Narcissist or possibly both. It doesn't exactly matter except to know that personality disorders cannot be fixed and that people who abuse will not ever stop. Read ""Why Does he do that?"" to understand that abusers will never stop, no matter what you do. If you can do it safely - there are free pdfs online.

1. She told him about you (ENORMOUS red flag)  
2. He's got access to her accounts or devices and is watching her interactions

Additionally, her kid knows about you/how to contact you, which is also weird considering you've never met.

23383,SulcataGirl,t2_2zfu43cd,"Okay.  This sounds eerily similar to my situation after leaving my abuser.  I really wanted to ensure he understood this was a him problem.  I think it finally sunk in when I explained that everyone of his previous relationships (including with his sister) he was abusive.  I, on the other hand had *never* experienced an abusive relationship before.  He called explains that it really hit him hard and he finally realized it may be true and started therapy.  He also finally realized his parents were/still are in an abusive relationship and he cut contact with his father for a while and now calls him out or leaves when he sees the toxic dynamic unfold when he's with them.  I hope this is true and he really is working on healing and recognizing abusive behaviors and tendencies.

I said I was doing it to help women in his future, but I eventually realized that talking to him in this way was still based on my desire and belief that I could ""fix"" him.  Also, every time we spoke, my anger and trauma would resurface and I knew it was unhealthy and inhibiting me from healing.  

I broke off all constant and 3 years later I am thriving.  It is not my job or your job to fix him, and this contact still allows them to control our emotions.  Even if they, and ""we"" think we're helping, it's not really our job or responsibility.  I still have a ton of anger issues, but not exposing myself to contact helps me immensely. 

I would never presume to tell you what to do.  Possibly giving him this book may be a good idea.  I really don't know.  From what I understand, it may help him recognize his behaviors, or just as likely provide him enough knowledge to leverage that knowledge in therapy or future relationships to his advantage.

23799,catcube,t2_gvuc8,"Every time you asked “is that normal?” Yes, it was normal. He has taken away your self confidence and that’s why you are questioning so much!
It helps to think “the things I did “wrong” in my relationship, were not actually wrong, they were just not the behaviours he wanted to see from me.”
He punished you to try and manipulate you into doing only what he wanted you to do.
He only saw you as somebody to serve him. I don’t know if they love us, I just know it doesn’t matter what they think at all. This is about you.
You need to forgive yourself. Nobody can understand the damage being in an abusive relationship can do to a person. We try and see the good in people until there is nothing left. The numbness is a very normal response. I told my counsellor it didn’t effect me when he abused me anymore, that I stopped being sad about it. I had no reaction. She told me that being numb too it made it harder to move away from. She said at least if we cried and hurt every time it would give us some motivation to leave. When we feel nothing we just sit around waiting for it to feel nice again.
I really feel for you as his family are fucking evil. You seem to have such a great grasp on your situation though, realising that them normalising the violence is not ok at all.
I know it hurts. We all have hard days. I can see already you will feel strong again. You have to work to break those thinking patterns, questioning yourself, blaming yourself.

Dont worry about what he felt, feels, or is thinking.

23807,Coollogin,t2_tg2k5,"I’m so sorry that happened to you. And I am so glad you and your daughter are out and re-building. 

You mention a couple of times your concern about being able to have a healthy relationship in the future. I wanted to share a few thoughts. I expect you’ll be able to go deeper into these ideas with your therapist. 

First: There’s no need to hurry. Seriously. You are so young still. There’s no reason not to be single for a good long while and focus on raising your daughter and establishing your career. If you feel pressure for some reason to find a man, talk to your therapist about it. Make sure you’re not assuming that your value is measured by your ability to get a man. 

Second: When you are ready to date, go slow. Preferably date lots of men before becoming exclusive with one. Experience the variety. And don’t continue to date anyone who raises red flags. 

Third: If you start getting serious with someone, always make sure you have a “back door.” That is, don’t get caught in a situation where you can’t walk away if you need to. Dont move in together right away. Don’t combine all your finances. Don’t quit your job and let him support you. Nourish strong relationships with friends and family so you have backup if you ever need it. 

Fourth: Now that you have a child, any man you marry or live with will have a relationship with that child. Learn about the many strategies for navigating the complicated waters of blended families. Always stay informed about this — the guidance will change as your child goes through her various stages of development. 

Finally: Think in terms of whether a man has earned the privilege of spending time with you. If he has done nothing to earn that privilege, drop him.",1588197002,fozubvi,t3_gac0h3,/r/domesticviolence/comments/gac0h3/truly_free/fozubvi/,2,domesticviolence,comment

*He says, “it’s your fault!” this time, you started it. But this time you know **you didn’t mean to** upset him. It was **just an accident!**

Next week, he says, “you did it, not me! You shouldn’t have __________.” So you question that **maybe you were wrong** or could’ve been more loving. **Next time you’ll be better.**

A few months later, he says “you’re the one who needs to apologize for your behavior. You’re lucky [he] stays.” And **you start to think you must have something wrong with you**, but... what...? Why are you like that? What’s wrong with you...? **You can’t keep being this way or you’ll lose him!**

And then one day, further down the road, he says, “you’re always to blame. You’re crazy/psycho/unstable/insane... You deserve it!” Then, **you believe he’s right... you must be a bad person** who deserves all this pain... **you don’t deserve to be loved** or treated well... you can’t live without him because **no one else will want you...***

I’ve lived those thoughts... I’ve been where you are and beyond. And none of what they do to you is right. None of the bad you believe about yourself is true. 

Please, please, please, don’t ever let it get past where it is now! You did *nothing* wrong, and he is violent, aggressive, and abusive towards you. **Take those pictures of bruises and file a police report ASAP!** Tell them what really happened, how he attacked and hit you for nothing, how you only wanted to de-escalate the situation so you both could be calm and talk about it, how he thinks he’s done nothing wrong. 

I hate to say it, but he will never change... Please, leave him. Block him. Seek help to heal. And create a life with someone who truly loves you.

I don’t mean to alarm you, but I feel the need to emphasize how serious this is as you’ve used a lot of language to downplay what he did to you. Strangulation (even if he didn’t press too hard *this* time) is one of the biggest warning signs that intimate partner violence will eventually lead to murder. The fact that he is so fearful of his masculinity being slighted (you accidentally touching him with a toy) is another BIG red flag. 

You’re very young and have your whole future ahead of you. Don’t waste any more time on this guy. He is not a good person. Wait to start a relationship with a guy who is kind to you all of the time. This one will 100% hurt you again if he has the chance. Even when they apologize, they eventually do it again. Yet he’s not even a little bit sorry. He has no empathy and sounds like a sociopath.

If they act abusive only towards their partner, not towards friends or coworkers, obviously they can keep themselves under control and that is domestic violence.

I've worked with lots of survivors of bad relationships, and I definitely don't think you are ""being crazy"" or are ""overthinking"" anything. I think you described lots of red flags of abuse. It's really common for abusive people to be charming at first, that's how they win you over, and then all of the bad stuff that you're describing starts to happen. There is even a word for when somebody emotionally manipulates you into thinking you are crazy, it's called ""gaslighting.""

I am concerned for your safety, because choking is a very dangerous behavior. I am worried it will escalate. Do you live with this person? Are you able to keep a safe distance from them during the COVID pandemic stuff?

Have you ever called a hotline before? Hotlines are really great. If you are in the USA, there is one called the National Domestic Violence Hotline. The phone number is **1-800-799-SAFE (7233).** If you feel comfortable, and you have a safe phone to use where you can talk in private, you may find them really helpful. They can explain a lot more about different types of scary behaviors to you, and help you figure out a good plan for what you want to do next. You can tell them as much or at little as you want, but it's never a bad idea to check in with someone just in case.

I hope you stay safe, and encourage you to reach out to someone who can talk about your specific situation with you in more depth. Good luck!",1588117848,fowdtss,t3_g9yft6,/r/domesticviolence/comments/g9yft6/im_confused/fowdtss/,1,domesticviolence,comment

This sounds like a really tricky legal situation, and they might be able to connect you with a special legal advocate who knows how to safely navigate this situation. It's really normal for people to be afraid of leaving, and rightfully so. The most dangerous part of an abusive relationship is right after the person leaves. 

Hotlines are equipped to speak with loved ones and they do so all the time - it sounds like it's too dangerous for your mom to call herself anyways.

24311,juliac210,t2_ttado19,"I'm glad you don't live with this person, phew. Abusive relationships can be really hard to recognize, but it sounds like you can pinpoint some behaviors that at best, feel ""off"" to you, and at worst, are actually life threatening (like choking you without your consent or a safe word). You are the expert in your own relationship, but it sounds like your partner is using a lot of behaviors and techniques that are really common in abusive relationships. Also, if the relationships just doesn't make you feel good, and you don't like what's happening, it probably isn't healthy for you. I know I don't know you, but I know that you are worthy of a relationship that makes you feel good and safe!

24316,Avivabitches,t2_5w7t6,"You are not crazy. At all. You are reaching out because you know something is wrong. What you are describing is a series of huge red flags. This is not how normal people act. I was in an abusive relationship. These are the first things that start to come up. It will get worse. Please save yourself from trauma. You deserve to be with a kind, safe person who honors you and treats you well. Trusts you, wants to bring you around his friends and family and vis versa. 

Many people who endure abuse are led to believe they are crazy by the abusive partner. You start to lose touch with reality, even if reality is right in front of you. My ex would deny texts I saw with my own eyes and made me believe I was somehow wrong. Manipulators will talk you into all sorts of things. They will reconstruct your reality to meet their needs and to help them get away with whatever they want. This is how you know something is wrong. Trust your gut. Always. 

I recommend reading the resource from the domestic violence hotline someone pasted below. Do some research on what abuse is in a relationship and you will see what you are experiencing is not normal. Sadly many of us as women are not taught what constitutes as abuse and thus find ourselves in bad situations when it is too late.

24317,SulcataGirl,t2_2zfu43cd,"So glad to hear you are listening to your inner voice telling you this is ""off.""  I don't see the the things you described as red flags of abuse, it already *is* abuse.  This is only two months into the relationship!  You are both supposed to be infatuated with eachother, loving and excited at this stage.  This is WRONG.  He's a textbook abuser already, and it will only get worse.  Choking is the leading predictor of intimate partner homicide.  It's never a joke.  And it's NOT sexuallly acceptable unless it's been discussed at length and consensual with hard boundaries with a person that makes you feel *safe.*

Get this man out of your life - immediately.  If you are still doubting yourself, read the books ""The Gift of Fear"" and ""Why Does He Do That?"". Both are easily available.  Your instincts are right, and that gut instinct is there for a reason.  Don't let yourself get more entangled.  Leave now before the stakes get higher - emotionally and physically.

Staying away from abusers is the hardest part, specifically because you want it to make sense. But their brains don’t function like yours or mine. 

Love is action. We’ve all been brainwashed with a poetic idea of love that it often hurts so much but it’s worth it for the connection. Real love is always actionable love. He can say he loves you because he doesn’t even know what love is. Many abusers conflate it with wanting to be wanted by a specific person.

24343,CDSEChris,t2_kwhkc,"Hey, friend. 

There's a lot going on right now, isn't there? Our schedules are all messed up, with everyone having to stay at home, stress is really high. Sometimes, people don't handle stress very well and get angry. If they're already fighting and having problems, adding more stress can just make it worse. 

You're probably staying at home, too, with schools being closed down for a while. My son isn't much older than you are, and I know it's hard for him to be away from his friends and the normal school schedule that he was used to. In other words, I know you have a lot going on right now. 

You deserve to be safe, and what's going on with your mom and step-brother is not okay. Really, your feelings and anger is a very normal reaction to a situation like that. It's good that you're able to reach out and get help for your anxiety. 

Many schools switched over to online, where they're giving your assignments through email or an online portal. That means teachers are still teachers and students are still students. If you have a teacher (or other adult at your school that you you trust), it's okay to reach out to them. School employees are what are called ""mandated reporters,"" meaning they have to report any concerns about a child's safety or violence that might put them in danger. Violence in the home is definitely something that counts. 

Why is that important? Because sometimes it's hard to explain to the police how serious a problem might be. And sometimes, there are police officers that don't respond the way they should by taking things like this very seriously. That's why people are telling you to keep calling the police (which is very good advice) if it keeps happening. But it can help to have someone on your side, like a teacher, who can help explain to the police what's going on and make sure they take it seriously. And I can tell you that police take reports from teachers and schools very seriously. 

One thing to remember is that you won't get in trouble with the school or police for asking for help, no matter how often you do it. Also, there's a lot more than police involved when it comes to violence in the home. The goal is to help the family get better, and the police can be the first step in doing that (there's other ways this can happen, too, but police are often part of the first steps). After that, organizations like child protective services or family services may get involved; their job is to make sure everyone's safe and gets the help they need. They can make people go to therapy or make sure they know there's consequences for violence. They're there to help your family get better. 

I like the advice that some people shared here. You're dealing with a lot, and it's really important to find healthy way to address it. Meditation, writing, music- any healthy and positive outlet would be helpful to reduce the stress.",1588167520,foy88y2,t3_ga2a9i,/r/domesticviolence/comments/ga2a9i/my_mom_and_and_step_brother_fight_i_need_help_im/foy88y2/,1,domesticviolence,comment

This is a serious as it gets, OP.

Refer her to the book ""No Visible Bruises,"" by Rachel Louise Snyder. You should read it, too. Refer it to everyone who loves and cares about her. It is so, so important to understand just what you have on your hands here - a potential homicide.

Kick him the fuck out. Do so publicly, with family, friends, and especially police present. Do not let her be alone right now. She is in danger. She is in the MOST danger after she leaves. Help her get a restraining order. Have her call a domestic abuse hotline. Help her schedule a therapy appointment. Have her research the law in your state about taking time off work to escape a domestic abuse situation. Let her stay with you as long as she needs. Whatever you can think to do to assure her she will be okay if she leaves him, do it. Encourage her to change her phone number, stay with relatives or friends that he does not know. Simply helping her understand she needs to leave is not enough - she likely knows that already right now but she feels trapped. She is afraid. Assure her that everything she is worried about will be taken care of and work with people who care about her to ensure that it is, to the best of your ability.

She has likely been isolated and emotionally abused to the point that she believes no one else cares about her but him, so even though she is with family - she feels alone. She wants to work it out because he is manipulating her and she thinks she deserves the abuse. The longer she can stay out of contact with him and be in therapy and domestic violence support groups, the stronger she will become.

My abuser choked me and often threatened to kill me. Before I escaped, he was thinking about getting a gun. I am 100% certain that if I had stayed, he would have killed me.

Don't let the same thing happen to her.",1588016816,forqowt,t3_g936wz,/r/domesticviolence/comments/g936wz/my_sister_was_chocked_and_then_kicked_in_the_face/forqowt/,3,domesticviolence,comment

Both eyes red due to hemorrhaging
Hemorrhaging in my mouth and vagina 
Damage to my neck with a chip fracture
Of one of my vertebrae
Neck was swollen 
Broken foot
Seizures started back up. I had them as a child

Anxiety. Always anxiety 

Next fight: he pulled out his gun
No one hurt. I de-escalated situation. I escaped in middle of night. I left everything there except my cat. He took all my money and belongings of financial value but I am alive. I say this not to be dramatic or for sympathy. I write this to beg everyone who has been hit and especially everyone who has been choked to get out of the situation. Do it with help because leaving is the most dangerous time.  Consult police detectives. I didn’t have much luck with domestic violence hotline but I think I spoke with a new person. 

He did not know where I went. I got a drop phone and changed all my contact info.  I found tracking devices on my car and later found multiple cameras in the town house when a group of my male friends went there to get some of my things. 
If you met him you would never believe him to be capable

There is a book called Helping Her Get Free that does a great job of outlining the role you can play. Please, please read it. It describes the three main roles you can feasibly play (rescuing, distancing, or anchoring) and will help you decide what is best for YOU. If anchoring is what you choose, it gives advice. 

Other posters are right, there is significant danger for her here. But getting free from an abuser is not as easy to victims as it seems to outsiders. The best thing you can do is educate yourself about abuse but especially about victims of abuse - you have to meet her where she is if you want to help her, and you will have to accept that she wants to go back to him. 

Tl;dr : there’s not much you can do to “make” her end this relationship - it will run its course and fighting her on it could push her further into his arms.

The feelings have abated somewhat as I've renovated, as it's somewhat become more ""my house"" than ""our house"" in the process, especially as I've removed the scars from the property (fist-sized holes in walls, dents in things from objects thrown at me, etc.) and changed how things look. Also got a new bed, slowly replaced furniture, and so forth.

I doubt the feelings will ever go away completely though, hence my determination to move. There's always memories popping up when I'm not in a good space... walk into a room and suddenly the memory of getting held down and punched in the face returns, that kind of thing.

I would imagine the police are looking for him and it’s possible he won’t come back there, but I wouldn’t take that chance. Strangulation is a heavier (felony) charge because it’s impeding breathing. Are you wanting charges pressed or just out of the marriage or situation? Without your cooperation, unless there is physical proof; nothing might come from the charges. However, if the officer has your initial statement and there are pictures of physical abuse and marks, the DA could pick up the case even against you wanting to prosecute.

25309,elaine6511,t2_6as5mpb3,"I won’t go into details, but the children will witness it and be involved eventually. Likely, they will either side with him and see you as incompetent, bad or everything you do is wrong OR feel for you and one day intervene and get hurt or killed themselves. I’ve been there where I think, “but he’s a wonderful father.” In short, he’s not. There are last effects of this abuse for them even if he never puts a hand on them. Also, I know you believe you might be killed or settle on a mediocre life because I’ve had the same thoughts. 

When you are tempted to go back to him, place yourself in that mental spot of when he’s abusing you and you cannot make it stop. Your heart races, your eyes swell with tears, but you try to stay strong for the children. You wish you could close your eyes and transport to a safe place as you are now trapped in misery. You almost die inside thinking, “I should’ve known better, I should’ve known he was never going to change.” Feel those awful feelings for as long as it takes for you to snap out of the wanting to go back and it gives a minute of strength. I know it sounds torturous and not a long term solution, but in the moment it could keep you from returning. I advise counseling if you have access to it. 

It’s hard because in leaving, you feel you are taking the kids away from their family and a good father. It runs through your mind that no other man could love them or care for them like he does. So, you become this sacrificial lamb for their sake. This is also part of the abuse and abusers know that. I suspect that might be a part in why it’s hard to stay away but he’s manipulating you.

25317,LoIIip0p,t2_10w7r0,"NAL. This is my experience with the same exact thing, in Los Angeles.  My boyfriend strangled me and my neighbor called the police. Two policeman showed up and because my neck was red still, they took photos and he was arrested. I did not want to press charges being young and dumb at the time but I literally had no choice. They explained to me that the DA prosecutes this and I have no say at all. They mentioned the laws had been changed after Nicole Brown Simpson.  He went to twin towers prison in maximum security for 2 weeks before he got his court date.  There was a mandatory restraining order placed on him for 1 year with no contact whatsoever and no third party contact either.  He didn’t have to go back to jail but he does now have a record and last I heard he was on probation for at least one year including drug and alcohol testing.   What I wonder in your case is how they are going to find him and make him come in. Bench warrant maybe?   I believe the charge he got was Corporal Injury to Spouse? Or something along those lines, because we had been living together for like a year at that point. I could be wrong though because it was quite a while ago.

My dad calls me a prostitute for no freaking reason (I bought a $5 steak to cook and he said I was going to end up becoming a prostitute ""just for the taste."") Let me tell you it is now the end of April and they have not changed one single bit. Ik this bc I secretly keep in contact with one of brothers. 

When I left I stayed at my friends house for about two months and now I'm staying elsewhere bc my university was able to help me for the rest of the semester. I changed my SIM card immediately and got my own phone plan asap(literally an hour after I'd left. I would recommend changing phones completely asap though). I'm in the US and I notified my university police and everything on my account is under lock and I mean EVERYTHING. Email, phone number, address, if I even attend or not, etc. I'm currently working with the financial aid office to try to get financial aid for next year. It's an extremely long process bc of all the paperwork I have to complete but if I don't I'll literally go homeless. My parents are trying to pull back their info so that I wont have the means to continue and be forced to go back. Let me tell you that if I go back, I will not be allowed to go back to school nevermind even stepping outside the house(I wasnt even allowed to do that anyways and if I did I got beat).

If they were, chances are good it would be from the tech company themselves, would require a warrant or subpoena. You arent going to likely expose this person in court yourself. You would want to have a experienced atty, one with lots of time in high conflict cases. And I would speak with them because they may tell you to report your experiences to the police because what you are talking about is a crime. They are the ones that deal with that. A lawyer would also be able to provide a background check through their resources. If there is no CPS case open for threats of violence or abuse of children, you are going to have a very difficult time.

Are you in touch with a therapist that is experienced in treating victims of abuse? Going through all of this is very traumatic. Having that objective guidance, support and validation in real life can be very helpful. Chances are good that if he has not been clinically diagnosed as a Psychopath (ASPD) you dont want to go spouting that off in court as if they have been. Only a qualified mental health professional who is treating the person in question can provide a diagnosis. As to being a pedophile, his statements that he has watched child porn, well, I dont know that would help much criminally. If you go to the police they may get a warrant to monitor his electronics to look for it. But evidence is needed, not just statements.

A psychologist can do play therapy with your kids, a session with you and a session with ex. They can observe the children’s interactions with each parent (from my understanding they are trained to look for certain body language / behavior) that they will testify towards in court. Request it through the court / your lawyer so he can’t refuse it.


You could also call DCP&amp;P and request them to do a psych evaluation if you are worried for yourself child’s safety. It’s hard if he’s manipulative.

If there is no previous documented history of the child pornography, threats to harm, violence or domestic assault; then it will be more of an uphill battle. Also, if he has not been previously officially diagnosed with a DSM classified psychiatric disorder, then I would highly avoid suggesting he has one as this could ended up hurting your case. What I would do is tell the appropriate people what you have witnessed and heard him say. You are a witness to this and that is better than nothing.

26298,silentraibow,t2_2ectq76c,"So sorry you are going through this. I can relate so much because I’ve done the same. I have huge remorse for helping my SO out only to be dealing with domestic abuse after all I’ve done for him. Long story short his grandmother passed and he went to lay her remains w his family back to their home country. Upon return, he was detained by ICE and was in danger of being deported to a country which he’d left as a child and no longer knew as his home. He was detained for over a month and we got him a lawyer to see if he could get a second chance. He is a permanent US resident but apparently he had a domestic charge from a previous relationship which could revoke the status. I went above and beyond to help him because of our children and the thought of them growing up with the pain of not having their father really hurt me. I was asked to gather as many character letters as I could to help his case when he saw the judge and I myself wrote the most warming letter I could. It was difficult for me to write that since I felt it was a lie but at that point he’d not gotten physical with me. He was granted another chance and the judge praised the letter I wrote saying that thanks to me he’d be given the chance. Tbh the other letters written for him were not bad but kind of weak. A prosecutor there snickered -“he’ll be back, you’ll see!”. This is the worst thing I could have done since now he has proceeded to physically hurting me. I have such remorse for being a coward and not doing the right thing then and feeling like an idiot for helping him out when he clearly doesn’t care for me.

26309,asyouwish,t2_3zb6f,"Can you ""encourage"" him to have more weed and less alcohol? He'd probably be a lot less angry. Angry Drunk is a thing, but I've never heard of an Angry Pothead.

If you can call anyone and he's within earshot, can you talk about something so random that your family/friend would know something is wrong, but that wouldn't tip off the abuser? For example, if I called my mom and asked how my great aunt is doing, that's pretty normal sounding, but I don't have a great aunt. If you keep talking about stuff that doesn't really exist, the person you call might catch on that something is wrong. The might start asking questions you can answer with a yes or no. Does he listen to both sides of your phone calls?

Can you write a real letter to anyone?

Does he ever give you bathroom privacy? Can you sneak the phone, pen/paper, other things in there? 

A friend of mine started a ""mad cleaning"" spree. When her abuser asked what she was doing, she said she was cleaning out old junk and making goodwill runs (and some of that was true). She even made piles of his things to go through. She had rented a small storage unit and was taking her important/personal things there. She did as much moving as she thought she could get away with before her departure day. She emptied the entire attic without his knowledge. Maybe her process can help you come up with a similar idea that will work for you. 

Can you help him find any kind of work online? I don't have a real suggestion here, but if was working and getting paid and feeling valuable in any way, that might help. Plus, he'd have to leave the Internet on. Plus, he'd be busy at least some of the time. Or, if not a paid gig, can you get him interested in any hobbies? I know that's difficult, too, but maybe there is something he used to do and liked. Fishing is free if you have a little gear. And while he might make you go with him, you might be able to go for a while near his fishing hole and that would be better than stuck in the house with him.

I'll keep brainstorming.

I agree.  My father came over while I told my abuser I was moving out.  My family helped move everything out while he was on a weekend business trip, and my father was there with me when he returned to protect me while I told him, gave back keys, discussed vehicle logistics, etc.  

You said you own the home, which is good, but makes things difficult because if you can't get a protective order you will most likely have to evict him.  Do you have an extra room?  If so, I would invite a trusted friend or family member to stay with you - from the moment you serve him the eviction notice until he moves out.  I think that would be the safest, most reasonable way to go about this.  If you have to evict him and you're alone for the 30 days (or whatever is standard in your jurisdiction) he will likely escalate.

26315,isabellemourning,t2_4ira3w8x,"Are you asking for a protective order or a domestic violence order? It would also depend on where you live. For me and where I live and where the person (plaintiff or defendant) is, you may have to wait outside for court to start (either get to court late so that's not so awkward or really early and wait by the doors depending on the size of your courthouse unless the other  person is in jail in which they will bring them in). Once it starts, I sit as far as I can from them and we get a calendar call for who will be seen and its alphabetically ordered so we are always last. (Fun) If you have an attorney your attorney speaks for you. If you dont you can speak for yourself or request one at this time. I have one in both of my cases (custody and child support) but for a DVO I had legal aid and before I had my attorney I had to represent myself and spoke for myself. I went to a desk when the judge called me and I went quietly and politely and spoke only when spoken to. No matter what my ex said (and if you are representing yourself I will suggest to keep quiet no matter what they say because they will make themselves look foolish. My ex does it in child support court all of the time.) If you have an attorney let them talk and keep a straight face. Give facts and be brief if you are called to the witness stand (if you get upset and cry that's understandable but being angry will get you nowhere with a judge). Always be respectful and say yes and no Your Honor (I'm from the south and throw a ma'am or sir in there too) and be demure (it's easy because court can be intimidating. But dont be scared. And if you feel like the person who hurt you is going to be threatening (like you have to go on break and have to leave when they leave), go straight to the bailiff and tell them! I've had to go to plenty of bailiffs and ask for security while we had a break and they are very good about personal protection for people who have suffered  DV. Also ask to leave first when your case is over before the person you are facing and have a sheriff walk you to your car. I always have this service provided for me! Better safe than sorry!

If you have no prior record of assault and she has no evidence (which if the story is laid out exactly as you describe, there is none) then it is unlikely you will go to jail or have to enter a batter’s intervention course. However, if the state does pick up the case, you could go to court or a trial. I highly recommend seeking a quick phone consultation with an attorney in your area. Sometimes they are even free. If she stays angry, be prepared to have a temporary protective order placed on you. This could also be dismissed by a judge if you’re not deemed to be a threat. If you are falsely charged then I would tread carefully with this woman. Someone who falsifies abuse and plays the court system in order to make an innocent man look abusive, often has angles such as custody and is highly dangerous.

Then he proceeded to pop my tires in the lot, causing me to drive on them and almost wrecking. 

Please learn from my mistake— this is the highest form of narcissism and even psychopathic behavior. 

They pursued all the legal stuff to attempt to get you to not press charges. It’s all one huge manipulation to for them to not see the consequences of their actions.

People like this always go on to hurt and manipulate more people and the only thing that helps start to make it unravel is evidence of repeated incidences like this. 

So it’s up to you, but please know that someone that is this vindictive will try to hurt you again. You must be careful. Getting a lawyer is the only option if you decide you can go through with pursuing this.

In jail, most of the women were beat up looking. I talked to a few who had similar back stories, and in there it was just accepted. Just “whelp, Fred’s drunk again, guess this much larger person is gonna fuck me up,” and if they manage to get a shot in edgewise, they get arrested. 

I can’t speak to other people’s stories, but mine legit does not make sense. My abuser was a felon on parole for violent offenses, and already had a DV charge from another county. None of this was taken into account. Oh and he’s 6’3” 220 to my 5’6” 150? Doesn’t matter. I was determined by the cop who arrested me to be the “primary aggressor” and arrested.

Don’t worry about being “taken away”; what they really want to do is just make sure that you’re safe. First they try to sort things out to make sure you’re safe at home. Sometimes that doesn’t work and they have to put you in foster care for a little bit, but it’s not that bad! It’s only temporary!

Maybe, you talk to the cops and have them escort you to the nearest shelter. Or try [thehotline.org](https://thehotline.org) to online chat with an advocate if you cannot call them. 

Or I pray that there is someone there who can truly help you escape.

Initially I didn’t want to go to court, but then I thought of the woman who comes after me. He might kill her. So to save her, I did it. I also thought about all the women who have died, and never got their justice. Then I thought about the stigma. If I don’t speak up, then keeping quiet will continue to be normalised. The stigma will prevail. So to break the silence, to bring justice, to bring change, I did it.

I started seeing this guy I really like but it seemed too good to be true. I decided I was going to break up with him before the shit hit the fan and me.  I sat him down and told him exactly how I felt. That I worried it wasn’t real, that I didn’t know how I would take his punch, he’s a big man a lot bigger then my ex.  That I wasn’t sure I was really capable of loving someone else like he deserved. He asked me to have faith in him, that he was not that man and that he would never treat me that way.  He asked me to let him prove himself.  In the end his kindness, patience and empathy were ineffably important to my healing process. We were together for ten years, we have a beautiful son together and even our divorce was amicable. We still live together with my now SO and our son.  He is still one of my best friends. Could it have turned out differently? Of course but until you’re honest with yourself and him you’ll only be left to wonder.

You just need to have a heart to heart. If not about your past that’s ok, but about what you want in your future. If you need to keep it slower and lighter hearted that’s entirely fine but if that’s truly the case, you need to share that with him. I had an ex who I was with for a year and he never saw a future but never bothered to tell me until after a year. I would have appreciated knowing sooner. 

When I met my now SO, I told him everything about my abusive ex. It was because it is important to me to be transparent about some of the things I suffer from as a result of the trauma from what I went through (I don’t like arguing, I will flee from arguments, I get stressed when isolated because I was isolated for so long with ex, and other things like that)..: How he responded made me fall in love with him almost immediately. He stayed up until 3 in the morning talking to me and asking me questions. He never once made me feel like it was something I should be embarrassed or ashamed of. He fully empathized. His sister is also a survivor so he understood a lot of what I went through and why I am the way I am still. My plan wasn’t to tell him that soon but I am happy I did because I knew early on just how amazingly lucky I am to have found him. 

After all of this, I have no doubt ok my mind that he’s the person I want to spend the rest of my life with. I saw his kindness and good heart even then by how much empathy and concern he had for a girl he barely knew and he still amazes me and inspires me every day with how good of a human he is.

First 5 years is already an accomplishment so congratulations on that. 
As for the rest: 
So at first I was t sure why she'd be scared of you, especially after this long if this has never happened before. A few questions came to mind... Have either of you been abused in anyway in your life? Going all the way back to childhood. I'm not in anyway saying this is the end all be all of answers just curious because in my own personal experience things like that keep going in some way, whether it's the act of or dating someone that is in some way abusive. It is so good that you were able to have a real talk with each other and come up with adult solutions to this and want to work on things together. 
As for the marriage thing. I have been married and fully believed in marriage. My question to her would be what does she want out of marriage? Or does she just want the wedding? She obviously loves you but marriage is really just a piece of paper and legal Bs. Ask her what would be different from getting married and what you have now. I ask you the same things. What would be different? You both love each other and want to be together so who is the one that is going to compromise? That's really what relationships are is a lot of  compromise. Drinking..... Why do you feel like it's not I guess logical that you could give up drinking? People don't every day. If you don't drink a lot as it is like you said it shouldn't be a problem. If you feel like maybe I just want a beer with dinner maybe see if she is willing to make that compromise and you have a beer at dinner once in a while or a couple at dinner. I wouldn't go over 2 though honestly. Especially since it was really the drinking that caused this all to happen. So that's my thoughts on it. I hope it helped in some way. Sorry it's so long but I am not a person to just tell someone what they should do.

Also remember the basics physics of the situation. When you are overweight &amp; fall over, you are more likely to injure yourself, purely based on the fact that the extra weight creates more energy on the part of the body you fell on.

29300,isabellemourning,t2_4ira3w8x,"Ok. So my modem got fried and while we are waiting on a replacement we are in a similar boat with the internet. First of all definitely call the school and see if you can get paperwork printed off for her. My youngest has a mix of paperwork and computer work and I'm going to try to do what I can for her via data on my phone. My oldest is laptop only but he's autistic and therefore has an IEP. Under US law, he is entitled to certain accommodations for his education. Does your daughter have any support like that? Does your school have any mini-modems they can provide? Are there any free public wifi spots your friend can get you to (we may go to the library)? What about a mobile hotspot on your phone (I'm also looking into that as my internet company is saying they may take a month to send our modem). Also many places (I'm in the US) are doing free 2 month internet services to qualifying families (getting the equipment is the problem but pressuring them may help) and you should definitely qualify. 
I have also been in your situation with your ex. Even in a pandemic you still have the right to protect yourself. I am not certain where you are at but I know where I am people can still go to the magistrate and file protective orders and you sound like you have plenty of evidence which is all you need. 
As for money when I left I only had my kids, some clothes, and my books. I had no job or anything and he had his family waiting on the lawn with guns, jeering at me. (I'm now in college to be a paralegal with custody of the children and married to a successful partner while they're still stuck in the trailer park.) I KNOW what that feels like. I've been through this. And it's totally ok to be rambling! You're absolutely allowed!

GIVE MY CHILD INTERNET FOR HER DAMN SCHOOLWORK!"" I wonder what they would say. This is such a strong argument for some sort of virtual court. And legal aid for domestic violence in all 50 states because this is unacceptable. (Our internet provider isn't the greatest either.) 
Contact her teacher(s) and see if they can send you some paperwork for her to complete. See if they can help you with the cost of sending it back. Reach out as much as you can. My oldest was in 1st grade (he's in 8th now) when we were going through the same thing you are and I remember having to switch 3 different schools with a non-verbal (at the time) autistic child and I would have lost my mind had it not been for the loving teachers who supported us.

Those could be incriminating if you go to a magistrate to file for protection order (but it may not end well for the dog either; I dont know). Verbal and emotional abuse can be harder to prove (text messages are very helpful) but if the home belongs to your father then he can go. Having some sort of proof that he is abusive, however, would be better. You could have an actual domestic violence order and they are more stringent and you have more protection rather than something like an eviction notice asking him to vacate the property. Just because he looks nice doesn't mean he IS nice. Ted Bundy was clean cut and he was a notorious serial killer. A decent judge will see through that. His big mouth and bigger ego will erupt and he'll look like an ass. I've been there with my own ex. I've seen it in court. Dont worry about that.

This isn’t easy for me type this. I struggle to put things into words. 

I will start with some background information about me. I am a 30 year old female. I have high functioning Autism. I have ptsd and EUPD. I have some physical health problems too. 

In 2013 I meet Liam online. Not his real name. He lived about 3 hours from me. We spoke on video chat for months. In 2014 we meet in person. We started a relationship. For the first few months the relationship was great. Things changed after a few months. Liam became verbally, sexually, financially abusive. He was controlling. He wouldn’t let me have a phone. He wouldn’t let me speak to friends and family. He insisted we was together 24/7. 

2017 I managed to escape from Liam. I had tried woman’s aid and they basically said they couldn’t help me because of my mental health problems- they were basically worried if they housed me I would commit suicide- I have a history of self harm and a lot of suicide attempts. I approach the council and they couldn’t help me because... I don’t want to give place names- I was told I had no local connection because I hadn’t lived there for 5 years- I lost my local connection to the last place I lived in because I had left. I
Lived in my home town Place A in 2013- moved to place B in 2014 and in 2015 me and Liam moved to place C and then we ended up back in place B. Renting privately was no option. Any money went to liams bank account. He wouldn’t allow
Me to work or claim money for my illnesses. I ended up sleeping on the streets for about two months before
I could get in contact with anyone in my family. 

So 2017 I am back with family. Things slowly get better. I get a phone. I get money. I am allowed to speak to who I want. I am allowed to leave the house when I want. I am allowed to seek help
For my health problems. 

December 2018 I met another man- let’s call him Andy. So we meet in person. At first we were just friends. At first we just said a few words to each other. I can be shy and not know what to say. We get to know each other over a few months. We get closer. We started a relationship. We would meet up in town. We would have meals together. We would go places together. He seemed like a really nice man. He treated me so well. He always paid. He always listened to me. Never did or said anything nasty. Always made sure I was home safe. The first day he come to my house he told me had been to jail. He said he learned his lesson and he would never do it again. He said he was really sorry for what he did. I didn’t ask what it was that he did. I know sometimes people can change. 

A few more weeks pass of us meeting in public- him coming to my house in the day time but never staying over night and one day he says to me he would like to move in with me- he tells he would have to tell his probation officer- his probation officer would have to meet me and he would have to tell me what he did. So he tells he flashed his penis to a 14 year old girl. I know that sounds bad. It is bad. I know he shouldn’t of done it. The thing is I guess I didn’t think much of it because when I was younger I always had older men shout sexual things out me and had a few show
Me their penis. His Probation officer says he can’t live with me but he can stay two nights a week. 

He asks me to send him dirty text messages. I don’t want to. I am not comfortable with it. But he asks and asks and says he will never tell anyone. I send them so he stops asking and I send them thinking it will be okay. The same thing happens with photos. He asked for a pair of my knickers. He even asked for a pair of my sisters. 

He stated questioning who I was friends with on Facebook. Started accusing me
Of looking at other men. Accusing me of cheating. He knew all the clothes I had If I
Got new ones he would question it. 

He messaged on Facebook one of his family members one day. I got a message from them. A message saying what he did. They wrote he is a dirty ..... who abused and groomed so many young girls.  I asked him about it and he promised me he was only guilty of flashing himself
To one girl but was sent down for doing it to another girl because she said it to copy her friend. 
 
So I will try to end this now. Word is out of that he is out of jail. His family know he is out. People around town know. It’s a small town i live in. People find my address. His address. People say I should stop talking to him because if I don’t then I am like Him. A post with his photo goes on social media. News paper clippings of what he did get shared. I want to stop talking to him. I block him. He calls me from a private number I changed my number . He emails me. I ignore him. I block him on social media he turns up at my house telling me if i don’t speak to him he is sharing the photos and texts
On social media and sending to
My family. I have to keep talking. I don’t want those pictures and text being shown. He threatens to show pictures of the knickers. He says he will tell no one he is in my house. He says it will be okay. He walks to my house with a hat on and tries to cover his face as much as possible. One day someone sees me in town as says to me something a long the lines of if we see him he is a dead man and if we see you with him you will get it too- I don’t want to get killed- I don’t want t get hurt- but I can’t stop Andy speaking to me-he tells me he will hurt me, he will break
Things in my house. He will break into my house, he will get other people to go into my house, he even told me he will get my sisters children taken away from her, he will make up that I sexually abused him and he will get me in jail if I say anything. 

One day he is in my house and because of how he always shouts at me, threatens me and always accuses me I am on edge someone calls me video calls me I don’t say Andy is there the person is just like hi are you okay and I am like yes and they are like are you sure and I am
Like yes I  am good thanks and like 5 minutes later people are banging on my window Andy got out the front Andy hide I went out the back and there are like where is he I say I don’t know I am told get in the car I am taken to a house nothing happened to me I was just told stay there was girls there we chatted they was nice but then the men went looking for him they had something to kill him with. He was lucky no one found him. But he says if I tell anyone anything he will tell the police I asked those men to
Come around I didn’t ask them to but basically I can’t tell anyone because he will tell things I did. I can either report and go jail- say nothing and be abused and possibly committe suicide. I can’t move as I have no money no where to go",1587242452,fntipcy,t3_g37z84,/r/domesticviolence/comments/g37z84/its_so_hard_to_type/fntipcy/,1,domesticviolence,comment

29316,easilypersuadedsquid,t2_ibjka,"Please do not have children with him. It sounds like your relationship only survived this long in the first place because you pussyfoot around him all the time. I know that walking on eggshells feeling and it's something most people in abusive relationships are familiar with. He sounds immature and selfish. He's a grown man not a toddler. He kept hold of that resentment all day without being violent and then when you tried to address it he intimidated you into shutting up. That's very controlling. It also shows he can control himself when he wants to and makes the whole thing seem calculated. He's controlling you by using his ""anger issues"" to constantly get his own way about everything. It's good he said he wants help but I wouldn't hold my breath for him to change if I were you. These things take time and hard life lessons. In my opinion someone is very unlikely to change unless their circumstances change drastically- in other words not within the space of an ongoing relationship. Make of that what you will ut you did say yourself that you think this is the end.

He can go to the GP and ask for a referral to a psychologist, and then ask for anger management help from the psychologist. This will take many months at minimum and possibly even longer just to get treatment and then after that it is something hewill have to work on on his own for a long time before seeing results.

Sorry but fundamentally I think this man is very selfish and controlling and you just can't see it for what it is because you spend so much time trying to avoid any conflict.

29323,savybooklover,t2_4nt4wksc,"Hey there. After reading what you wrote I will give my opinion. That is absolutely abusive behavior emotional abuse and verbal abuse often leads to physical abuse later. Even if it doesn’t if effects are disturbingly similar. This forum is full of people who will tell you to leave now. Ultimately you are the only one who can decide to do this. You have the power to decide if this is how you want to be treated. Because it won’t stop it will continue to get worse as you become used to the behavior. Escalation isn’t a question just a matter of time. 

Also I just want to say that no matter how you behaved there was never a reason for him to belittle you berate you threaten you and punch holes in walls and throw things at you. Abusive men do this as a way to gain control and power. 

This book changed everything for me. It will help you make your own decisions about what is best for you. I wish you best keep us in the loop on your journey.

It may be something you are willing to put up with right now, even if it frightens you and you hate it when it happens and you know something is wrong. Right now the ""love"" is enough.  


But he doesn't love you. He loves controlling you. He loves abusing you. He loves the adrenaline of hurting you. But he doesn't love YOU.  


And soon damaging things you love, destroying your clothes, hurting you with bites and spanking, being withholding - that won't be enough. It will get worse.  


You have to hit your own rock bottom in the relationship. Nothing I or anyone can say will convince you to leave sooner than that.

29801,SulcataGirl,t2_2zfu43cd,"&gt;Crying on another twice-weekly therapy session yesterday, my therapist told me to take the opposite action of what shame makes you want to do, which is hide things from the people you love, and open up.

This was *exactly* the correct advice and I'm glad you've begun to do so with those close to you.  From the moment I told my family about the abuse, which I'd been hiding, the abuse became REAL to me in a way it never had before.  I received an outpouring of support, offers to help, and saw their horror regarding my situation.  I'm lucky, I know not all victims receive this reaction. 

After that point, I knew I would be held accountable, by myself and those that truly loved me.  I *had* to take action, even though it terrified me and was the most difficult thing I've ever done.  

So, to your question about what to do, lean on your support system, reach out to your local DV organization for resources and tools, make a plan to leave.  If not, you will become a ghost of yourself.  The love and good times are not worth the  death of your individuality, hope, and future.  

PM me if you need reassurance or just a person to talk to.  You can do this.  There's a light at the end of the tunnel.  I promise.  You will be happier and stronger than ever on your own.  And one day you will meet someone able and willing to love you the way you deserve.",1587137534,fnp1en6,t3_g32tte,/r/domesticviolence/comments/g32tte/my_24f_boyfriend_of_two_years_29m_is_abusive_i/fnp1en6/,1,domesticviolence,comment

29804,Chels_365,t2_63rng8tw,"OP , I myself am currently in a very abusive relationship. I have been with this man for almost 6 years we even have a child together. Similarly at first I was on cloud 9 I myself have depression and suffered from low self esteem. So when this man came into my life I thought he was the best thing that has ever happened. I was wrong it has been the worse 6 years of my life I sacrificed friends and family for him  thinking that I love him and having this idea things will get better . Well they didn't so we decided to live separate for 2 years. those two years I was separate I had started to find myself , love myself lost weight was feeling great! Then I fell back into the trap he told /me "" I am changed I promise I will never hit you or disrespect you, just give me chance to prove it all I want is my family back"" So I moved back in literally a month and half ago. Since I moved back in 6 plus incidents of abuse occurred both verbally and psychically he  calls me b\*\*\* , slut, fat pig, psycho, tells me no one will ever love me, I am just a cum dumpster a lot of hurtful things. This last week he has been on edge and very very mean , so two days ago he snapped punched me , kicked me , through me to the ground  and shattered my cell phone. My son was not around to witness this thankfully however after a month and a half I realized he is NEVER going to change that is not LOVE ! I know I deserve better. Yesterday he apologized and said it would never happen again. I have made the decision when he is not here I am leaving and never turning back.

I share this with you because it sounds like you are early on in the relationship . Get it out do not waste your life I know you love him as I loved my abuser but believe me when I say it gets worse and I have been experiencing. The abuse will break you down and eat at you it destroys you emotionally, mentally and physically. I am broken and feel lost and hopeless its a battle between life and death. You just have to find your worth as I am trying to find mine. I am not much help because I am still in the situation but,  speaking from experience it is not worth it it will just rob you of your self worth and happiness and you just like everyone else deserves to be happy and respected.",1587139610,fnp5kx4,t3_g32tte,/r/domesticviolence/comments/g32tte/my_24f_boyfriend_of_two_years_29m_is_abusive_i/fnp5kx4/,1,domesticviolence,comment

29808,mogave,t2_2mpa9ttf,"Abusers do not love a person, they love what that person gives them. They love control, they love companionship, they love sex, they love the perks. But they do not love you. That “fierce love” you feel is what they bribe their victims with to keep them around while you’re raked through the mud. Abusers rely on your affinity for those good times, it’s their bargaining chip, but the good times aren’t born out of love they’re born out of pathological necessity. They know you won’t stay if it’s all bad, if they are who they really are the whole time. So they give you a mask! But don’t be fooled, every thing they’ve done, every meal they’ve bought, every emotional soliloquy they’ve offered up is not for you. It’s to strengthen their own arguments.

I guarantee when you argue he brings up everything he’s ever done for you, while only citing your “downfalls”. An abusers favorite sentence is “after everything I’ve done for you, you have the audacity to defy me”.

I hope you can leave this fake love at the door. I’m glad you’re still close with your support systems, that’s something a lot of people in your situation are without. Abusers erode those ties very quickly, and yours will too eventually if you stay. And once he has you all alone it will escalate. It will not get better, only worse.

29821,btendr,t2_1glcaku8,"It's one of the most difficult things to talk about in re: to IPV but what abuse does is plant a seed. Though you sound scared, you may also be thinking I can handle this, I love him, this is not necessarily all that bad. But that's the thing - the seed has only been planted and you haven't seen what it will sprout into.

I don't want to scare you but the seed will very likely grow into trauma, as it does with most human beings, and this is the part that's way outside of your current thinking that you can handle it. Trauma will make your life a hell in ways you can't imagine. You could be trying to heal for years. It is likely to be excruciating and you may (quite likely) experience very strong, overpowering emotions you aren't experiencing now. Healing from routine rape is not a walk in the park. When someone hurts another person, the effects are often not immediate.

So that is why it is imperative to get out now. Some seeds have been planted, and he better not plant any more. That will make things harder. 

I believe in you. You deserve real love and consideration, which can come in many forms, not only via having a boyfriend.",1587158124,fnq5m7m,t3_g32tte,/r/domesticviolence/comments/g32tte/my_24f_boyfriend_of_two_years_29m_is_abusive_i/fnq5m7m/,1,domesticviolence,comment

Even if you and him aren't living together you may have to give up where you live to get safe.  You can likely get into a shelter in a different town and essentially disappear.  Get a fresh start, move on and get out of that town.  It will only get worse and you are worth so much more than that.  You are taking a great first step in reaching out.  I've used the shelter system and like I said, there is no requirement for you to report the incident to the police, although they will encourage you to.  They will assist you in finding work and getting on your feet.  Domestic violence shelters are getting better and better.  Most of the women that run them have come out of extreme abuse themselves because once they found freedom they wanted to help other women get free.  They understand the intricate dangers of leaving an abuser.  They understand that it's not always safe to report an abuser and sometimes it's best just to disappear.   Best wishes ❤ take care of yourself.  You're worth it!  Own it!  Be careful, you know your situation better than anyone, but from what you've said, your best option would be getting as far away from the whole group as possible and never look back.",1587166281,fnqk8wh,t1_fnpznj3,/r/domesticviolence/comments/g37z84/its_so_hard_to_type/fnqk8wh/,1,domesticviolence,comment

They just may not know how to provide the support we are looking for. In your case, validation that these experiences occurred. They weren't there. They did not see. It sounds like you are wanting your friends and family to confirm and verify for you that the abuse is happening, but they can't or won't. This is not their fault, but it is disappointing and hurtful.  


Please seek professional therapy - a therapist will provide that support and validation and help you heal from the abuse.  


For now, trust yourself. Your abuser wants  you not to trust your experiences, your instincts and your pain. But you know. You know something isn't right. You know this isn't love. You know this is dangerous.

Things seem really highly charged between you right now.  There has been a lot of emotional investment in this relationship from both of you and having a baby on the way is really important.  There is so much to lose by letting it all fall apart now.

Your man sounds like he's not feeling secure with you and he's hurting inside.  He might fear losing you to someone else.  He might not be confident enough in himself to believe this won't happen.  This drives him to check up on you.  He should not do this but behind this behaviour he's scared of being hurt by betrayal.  Perhaps he's been hurt before.

Open discussion about how committed you are to each other, focusing on the positive things you have achieved together, showing appreciation and recognition for each other's good qualities, all of these things might help you restore confidence in each other.

Please try to resist arguments escalating into a physical fight.  It is really destructive to all you have built together.  Back away and time out.  Don't put up the wall of silence.  Talk calmly.  Share your feelings with each other.  Be honest.

This is a dangerous thought pattern to have and extremely detrimental to your recovery, and if you ever hope to be free of him mentally or physically, you need to drop this line of thinking immediately.

This man does not love you, he never has. This is a fact and it cannot be debated. If he loved you, he would not treat you like this, and if he loved you, you wouldn’t need to be on this sub asking for advice.

What this actually is, is codependency, and it’s not healthy in any way, codependency is what keeps him from leaving you.

The good you think you experience is your abuser literally just ‘having a good day’. Abusers do not always behaving abusively, it can often come in bursts. For example he’s fine for a whole week, or maybe two, or maybe even a month, and then the abuse begins again. A break does not mean it has stopped or he has changed. It means just that. A break.

If you really want to be free of him, now is the time to lean on your family and friends more than ever. When I left my abuser I was terrified, ashamed, angry, hurt and terrified again. Nothing felt real, and I felt I had potentially ruined my life by leaving him, a man who once raped me.

It’s not going to be easy, it will take everything you have, EVERYTHING. But trust me when I tell you, it can be done.

Baby steps are key, you are allowed to feel love for him, you are allowed to miss him and pine for him, but you must remember above all, that you have been *manipulated* into feeling this way.

30800,PrincessShhhhh,t2_q416uxq,"This certainly sounds like a painful, difficult situation and I am very sorry that this is happening to you and likely has been for a long time. It sounds like you feel helpless and trapped right now because of the abuse and enabling. But, there is hope.

  
You are 18, legally an adult. You can leave, but you have to accept that life will be difficult in a different way than it is now. It sounds like life is already difficult and leaving your parent's house will mean facing new and scary challenges that you may not feel ready for yet. I can only tell you that as a survivor of parental and partner abuse, it feels so good to be free, that IT IS WORTH IT.  


Abusers are addicted to control. Your mother wants you to believe that you can't. You can't live on your own, that you need them, that you can't afford to live outside their house. That you couldn't possibly escape.  


But, you can. It's not easy. No one will pretend it's easy. In many ways, your life is easier now - you have a place to live, go to university, and other luxuries I'm sure. But, it also means being abused.   


You can support yourself. Apply for unemployment. Look for an essential worker position at a gas station or grocery store or at UPS. Many jobs offer tuition reimbursement, like Chevron or UPS. Stay with friends while you look for a house with a room for rent. Purchase a flip phone and phone cards until you can afford your own plan. You may have to stay at a homeless shelter.   


But, you'll be free.   


The choice is yours to make.   


Until then, I encourage you to keep reaching out. Keep a written record of the abuse somewhere. Take pictures of your injuries on a sibling's phone or with a webcam. Let your professors, neighbors, friends, etc. know what is going on. Abusers want their behavior to be kept secret - they want to keep you silent, so you must be brave and be loud about what is happening.  


I wish you the best of luck.",1586969484,fnhvdbg,t3_g1t5xi,/r/domesticviolence/comments/g1t5xi/how_can_i_get_help_without_letting_my_abusive/fnhvdbg/,1,domesticviolence,comment

She may even chose to come and live with you and have you as her guardian and you two can pursue a better life. By staying, you may be showing her that she should also stay. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wish I could emphasize how good it feels to be on the other side - to feel safe, to be loved - truly loved and not manipulated and controlled, to be independent, to hold the power and choose when and if and how you communicate with your parents, to know that whatever you accomplished, you did it without them.   


However, I was not strong enough to do it at 18. I was not willing to make those sacrifices to escape. But, I wish I had.  


If you know what you would do if you were not afraid, then you know the right thing to do.  


But, do not feel ashamed if you stay until it is safe for you to leave. Do not feel ashamed if you stay longer than it was safe.

31297,a5121221a,t2_atd2z,"I am not a professional, but from my own experience, I recommend against talking to him about abuse at all.  You read ""Why Does He Do That?""  You've probably read other resources online.  He already knows he is an abuser.  He doesn't want to be called out because it threatens what he sees as his power over you.  I suggest you don't let him know that you plan to end your relationship and don't let him see your preparations.  I suggest you don't let him know you recognize his abuse.  Abusers are the most dangerous when they are losing control over a victim, especially when the victim is about to leave or in the process of leaving.  The time you leave is the time you are most likely to be murdered.  One plan that has helped a lot of people in the preparation stages is the gray-rock method (be as uninteresting as possible so the abuser doesn't notice you and loses interest).  There are a lot of resources online about it.  In my case, I didn't hear about the gray rock before I left.  I just stayed as calm and pleasant as possible and knew that I would eventually be free of his abuse.  I suggest not changing routines so he won't be alerted (i.e. if you always say ""I love you"" before bed, say it even when you don't mean it).  Your life could depend on little things like that, but above all, getting help from a domestic violence shelter and a counselor who has professional education on these issues is of utmost importance.

No.

It is so good that you can recognize this. Now focus on grasping that it’s a desire you won’t get to fill. Write all that shit down for yourself, if you want, but don’t try to say it to him. If he were to ever admit to being abusive, it would be part of a ploy to convince that he’s changed. Any attempt to show him who he really is will only leave you vulnerable to his manipulation.

Avoid antagonising him in any way, particularly if you guys are in an area experiencing social distancing/isolation restrictions.

Go about like everything is completely fine and then you can get out when the time is right and you are ready and able.

I can tell you, in my opinion, that he knows what he is doing and he chooses to keep doing it to you.  He knows he's being unkind and hurtful to you when he does what he does. How can you reason with that and expect him to change? If he keeps hurting you (whether it's verbally or physically) over and over again, that's a choice he's making.  He's choosing over and over again to hurt you. He knows what he's doing. And he's okay with it.  You deserve kindness and happiness.

This is great!

Beware of a tricky area that's easy to fall into: sometimes they'll be on ""good behavior"" for a while, and then ""slip up"" once. Or maybe twice. Or maybe it's good for a while and bad sometimes, but then good again. This rollercoaster can keep you stuck in a bad relationship for years or a lifetime, just giving out chances and living for those good periods.

The trick is to set very clear boundaries for yourself. How many verbal explosions a year are you willing to live with? How many physically abusive slip-ups are allowed in the next year or for the rest of your life? The answer should be zero, but if it isn't, put a number on it. This will make it much more clear to you that you need to leave when you reach that number, because you will have already promised yourself it is something you would not tolerate, even if it is a ""mistake"" or a ""one-time thing,"" or ""part of the growing process.""

However, if my partner was neglectful, didn’t contribute to any household chores or straight up refused to spend any time with me because they were too busy being on social media, then I’d want to leave them too. I’ve been with someone like you before and it’s absolutely infuriating. Slamming doors out of frustration is scary, but not abusive because they’re not directing their anger at you. Your partner is frustrated with you because you refuse to listen them and acknowledge their feelings. They have tried time and time again to communicate with you and you refused. Why are you surprised that they no longer want to be with you? Everyone has their breaking point.    
Hitting people is absolutely never okay. Your relationship sounds incredibly toxic on both sides, so you need to let go and move on. Focus on improving yourself.                 
Edit: I just wanted to add that I am in no way justifying your partner’s behaviour. However, my abusive boyfriend would often try to gaslight me and I would slam doors or throw things (not at him) out of frustration, because I felt like I was losing my mind and didn’t know how to deal with it. He ended up choking me once after I threw something and I haven’t done it since. But that could explain why your partner is slamming doors and throwing stuff around.

31804,secondhandbanshee,t2_3woxk3sk,"I was 48 with children and lost everything to get away. It's hard for a long time. I wish I could fix things for you, but since I can't, here's my tiny bit of insight on what worked for me.

1. Accept help. Being with an abuser keeps you isolated and teaches you that you are a burden and don't deserve help. That's a lie designed to keep you from escaping. You deserve help. There are people who actually want to help you. Let them. 

2. Find a way to help others. Even if you're flat broke, you can find a way to give of yourself. Doing this will do wonders for your self-esteem. It's important to feel like you're giving back. 

3. Getting better is not a straight line. You'll do great and then you'll hit a day or a week that just sucks. It's ok. Think of it as a road with switchbacks. You feel like you're going backwards, but it's just part of the process of reaching your goal. 

4. It's ok to be angry about all that was stolen from you, materially and psychologically. Don't let that anger become an anchor, though. Use it as jet fuel to get you where you want to go. When you think you can't do something, spite is a useful motivator. 

5. Get every kind of support you can. Your family and friends can't be your only support system. You'll burn them out. That's not your fault. It's the nature of recovery from abuse. Get a therapist from your local mental health center. Join a DV support group. Get another therapist online (some of those programs have financial aid). Join a women's support group. (Yeah, I know it's all virtual right now and privacy can be hard to get, but sit in your folks' car if you have to. It's worth it.) 

Make your closest people a safe zone where you don't avoid talking about the abuse, but you don't focus on it either. Allow yourself to build positive memories of this time that don't involve thinking about the past. Think of each memory as a weight on the positive side of a scale that is tipped way over to the negative by the abuse. Every new good experience takes a little of the imbalance out of your life. Someday, the positive side will be heavier. 

6. As hard as it is not to ruminate about the past, try to focus on the future. Think of a goal that will make you happy and start moving towards it. Little tiny steps are still steps. And it doesn't have to be a huge goal. Learn to bake bread or paint fancy designs on your nails. Take a free online class in something interesting to you. 

Look at the things that worry you--no job, for example. Ok, you can't go job hunting while the lock-down is happening, but you can decide what kind of job you want. Make or revise your resume. Look online, maybe there's something available even now. 

And on the days when you can't face the future, give yourself permission to rest. You aren't the Energizer bunny. You can have bad days. You can binge watch a silly tv show and eat half-baked brownies in bed. Just don't settle in and live there. If the next day feels just as bad, do one little thing that seems hard. Take a shower or get up and make your bed, even if you just lie down on the covers afterward. 

It gets better. It's a slow process. You will get through it.

31817,mixed-berries,t2_2qgohn7z,"So, a couple things that you should give serious consideration to, in my opinion: the biggest is that you say he’s having an anger management problem... but that he can control it so he doesn’t show it in front of the kids. That tells you he isn’t out of control, he’s using it when he wants to and only directing it at you. His outbursts are benefiting him, plain and simple. Second, you say he’s not constantly abusive. Most abusers aren’t. My husband would go months without physical violence, too. Most of us stay because of those good times, you realize afterwards that you’ve been living your life chasing those days instead of just living your life. You start thinking I shouldn’t have done this, I should’ve known better, if I just don’t nag, if I just do all these things better/different/perfect- then we’ll have more good days. You will always have the violence because it’s a cycle; that he choked you is an incredibly serious attack. Choking is a good indicator of potential that the violence will escalate to murder. Violence always escalates. Next time, maybe you’ll black out. Will you wake up? Are you willing to take that chance? I can tell you, I couldn’t leave for myself; I left for my daughter. Think seriously about what happens to your children if they witness abuse their whole childhood or if their mother is killed or if someday violence against you isn’t enough and he hurts them— you need to leave for them if not yourself.",1586807761,fnb1vov,t1_fnaza7z,/r/domesticviolence/comments/g0od6r/not_sure_what_to_do/fnb1vov/,3,domesticviolence,comment
31818,suckmydickimalady,t2_65ncfql2,"Like all abusers, he’s going to be abusive towards anyone he can’t control.  As your children get older and try to gain their independence it will start seriously affecting them.   By that time making excuses for his behavior will be common place.  You’re already making multiple excuses for inexcusable behavior and then feeling guilty about his choices.  He knows exactly what he’s doing &amp; he’s making the choice to continue that behavior.  You’re enabling him and your children see it.  When you decide you don’t want abuse to negatively affect your children you will realize they deserve a loving supportive healthy environment to grow up in and you will leave him.  Because he’s not going to change in a positive way, he’s only going to become more violent towards you and then towards others he feels he can’t control.  In 3 years of advocating for domestic violence victims, I’ve never ever had even one single victim tell me their abuser stopped the abuse or even lessened the abuse.  Every victim I’ve encountered has consistently told me their abuser became more abusive, either until they fled or they were murdered by their abuser.  What would your children think &amp; do if he had choked you long enough to kill you???

31822,justpeachy7777,t2_259yfr3,":( It is a very confusing and sad time.
It’s not anger if he only acts like that towards you. People with anger problems will also yell or become physically aggressive with family members, a boss, coworkers, friends, etc.
I am very worried for you because you told him you would leave. It is great you set a boundary but he has already choked you, statistics show you are in the category at highest risk of death. He may become more aggressive because he now feels he could lose control.
No one is all good or all bad. I’m sure he really is a good dad and loves you in a way. My ex did as well.  But that doesnt mean it is safe or healthy to be with him.

Specific advice:

Call or chat with the domestic violence hotline. They will probably encourage you to leave but just tell them you’re not ready, there are plenty of other resources they can offer hopefully locally.

Read Lundy Bancroft’s Why Does He Do That? book. It gave me a better understanding of dv and expectations moving forward. 

Find a counselor with domestic violence experience. See them alone. Discuss your feelings, martial issues, etc. Even if its not about this issue it will help you think about everything. 

Have a backup plan and pack a backpack or large purse with you and your sons documents and essentials in case things get much worse. Decide where you could go for an evening or two- a friend’s, a hotel, family nearby, etc. Just in case. Move some money into a new bank account in your name only as a security fund.",1586813708,fnbdpnv,t1_fnaza7z,/r/domesticviolence/comments/g0od6r/not_sure_what_to_do/fnbdpnv/,1,domesticviolence,comment

31829,ItNeverRainEveryDay,t2_5u00666o,"Feeling as though you're breaking from the inside--I know what that feels like. For me, it was a gradual darkening of my spirit. My husband was so dark that I was starting to not be able to protect myself from it anymore. I couldn't feel joy anymore. I was never actually happy. And then the stress starting affecting me physically. I broke out in a crazy rash on my face that just wouldn't go away. I'd feel anxiety over seemingly simple things. I would have to tell myself to take deep breaths sometimes because I just didn't feel as though I was getting enough air. 

After he left, I started meditating and focusing on breath, and my lungs actually hurt for a little while because they weren't used to deep breaths. But I'm so much better now. I'm still in the middle of this divorce, but I feel peace and joy. I'm dancing again. I'm just happy that my spirit is healing after such a long time of being repressed.

Being hit is not okay. Most people know that. But sometimes it's hard to tell if you're being emotionally abused or not. If you feel as though you're breaking apart, then something needs to change. You can't live like that. You deserve to be happy and at peace. Do you still love her? If you do, then you'll need to decide if you're ready to give that up in order to heal and feel that peace you so desperately need. I believe that the benefits of that peace will outweigh the loss of love you may feel. Something definitely needs to change, or this stress may start affecting you physically, too.",1586827651,fnc36ty,t3_g0pmy4,/r/domesticviolence/comments/g0pmy4/i_cannot_keep_it_anymore/fnc36ty/,4,domesticviolence,comment

31832,mausratt1982,t2_ymfna,"First two paragraphs— identical to my story. But I was 27 when I left mine, 29 when I came out of the heroin fog, and just recently at 31 came out of the methadone fog. 

You have *so* much time to rebuild and create the life you want. I was a transfer student so I didn’t even start at a 4 year college till I was 23. Unfortunately met my husband a few months later and it was downhill from there. Protip: do not go to college married, and don’t worry about a 2-4 year age difference with your classmates at college because they honestly can’t tell and/or think you’re cooler because of it. 

Please honey, don’t get stuck for fuckin years like I did. Use the motivation you had to get yourself out of that situation to propel yourself into the life you want. I know the anxiety and ptsd are crippling. Find ways to work around them— all classes are online right now anyway. Throw yourself into what you love, do as much of it as you can, when you can and take a break if you gotta break down for a minute. 

I really think putting your energy into rebuilding the life you wanted will make the ptsd episodes and anxiety attacks fewer and further between. The worst thing you can do right now is give up, quit trying... like I did. 

As for your question: with heroin involved, I had a great excuse to just not put my life back together. I was living with my mom, she preferred me on heroin and kicked me out as soon as I got clean but that was the best thing that monster could have done for me. That’s when I really started to recover. To sum up: get yourself into a safe, stable situation with friends and family for a little bit, get a job you enjoy, and definitely go back to school to study something you love.

No one else has pointed this out, but I think your partner has a problem with your social media use because they’re trying to isolate you from your friends and family. This is a really common abuse tactic. They are chipping away at your safety net.

Sure, leaving messes or using your phone while talking to someone aren’t the greatest habits. But if your partner is making you feel scared that is 100% a red flag and in itself evidence that the relationship isn’t healthy.

Different from saying ""I am glad the abuse happened in public because you deserve it.""

I can kinda understand your friend sitting with her husband and drinking while the two bros sat there drinking, but the best I can say is nobody has integrity or principles, because a principled man AND woman who is opposed to violent abuse would be disgusted by him - and would reject him even if they 'like his company' when he's not doing that.  (maybe he's 'charming' in some narcissistic way)

It's *possible* that they were telling him he MUST get psych help -- to avoid hurting you again and avoid himself going to prison for DV or murder -- it's *possible* was the context of their drinking conversation.  It's *possible* they were pressuring him as old confidantes, ***but that's a long shot***, especially if he has not taken any concrete actions since then.  I mean concrete actions, no wavering, no questions whatsoever.

And even if he ***has*** begun taken actions, that doesn't mean he's gonna get some magical instant enlightenment and not continue to be a violent fuckup .. escalating.

I'm mostly leaning on your best friend is 'nice' but lacks any relationship with integrity or principles that she wouldn't compromise for her husband and husband's friend, just to keep the peace and enjoy the evening, or whatever.  Not implying that solid principles and integrity is common.

I second Shadosaidgo.

I would add that violence to objects = a threat of violence to you, even if he says he keeps that separate, it's a *display* of violence a/o rage out of control.

I can understand his background in out-of-control rage, and not having had emotional cool-down control manifested in his childhood.  Re-enacting past trauma as a perverse form of ""therapy"" on automatic pilot, that is typical textbook shit.  As if the argument 'triggers' his childhood, but that is *his* problem.

My close friend didn't experience rage until their wedding night and honeymoon, over some minor thing.  They got divorced after decades, but stayed together longer than appropriate due to various serious life complications.  He would briefly take responsibility and 'change' but he couldn't sustain the change even tho he had sufficient tools at his disposal to begin and continue.

YES.

And the way I have noticed that abuse is sometimes kept muted when there's an escape hatch, a chance of losing the game, but then comes out when situations close off the easy escapes and the chances of loss and pain are minimized.

I noted from this story that the guy *seems* like a good enough guy on some level, is aware of his flaws on some level, seems like he's salvageable ***if*** he's willing to do the intense or tedious work to salvage himself, but those are significant ***ifs*** to meet.

Victim seems to hint at what could be passive-aggressive behavior on her part, though passive-aggressive doesn't ever justify violent aggression.  

&gt;He tells me that my ""need to discuss things multiple times and justify myself"" nature really bothers him.

Sometimes its best to go to a shelter, and other times its best to look at creating a safe exit plan. That can take time and focus to bring to fruition. So I recommend you make the call. They can refer you to a therapist who is experienced in abuse (you are being abused) to help you with support and objective guidance. And the abuse agency can help you create a safe exit plan that keeps you on track with focus over time. Something thats hard to do when you are being abused. So I recommend a long term plan. And do all of this quietly. Safely. Do not confront him, call him abusive or a narc or anything.

My ex-partner has a key and that scares the shit out of me. I have no money and no credit and because I am single the shelter tells me to apply for section 8. That takes months and that's if I even qualify. I haven't been to work in over a week because I don't want my ex-partner to show up. I can't go anywhere or do anything because I have absolutely no money and because I could get arrested for traveling. Basically I'm fucked because the law doesn't care right now about people like me. If I got money I would be dying to leave the state but it's literally aganist the law right now. I get it it's a scary virus but I live in fear everyday of my god-damn life. I have been getting sicker and sicker mentally and physically because of this abuse but I'm not allowed to feel safe. I have to worry that is he gonna come find me. Is gonna hurt me. Is gonna taunt me some more. Like seriously I honestly almsot checked myself into the mental hospital and was gonna lie and say I was gonna kill myself.

32328,v0ness,t2_2orvpkti,"DV counselor here. Sorry to hear about your experience right now. Many shelters are at capacity rn. There has been a spike (41%) spike in DV calls to the police since the lockdowns began in America.

There are a few other options depending on the state you live in. Shared housing is a service (in some states they work with the government) that pairs you with a person/people that you should be compatible with or share a background with. (Like another survivor.) The rent is only 500 a month(in Washington state), includes everything. 

The other option sounds daunting, but honestly, myself and the women I have helped have had good experiences. Craigslist. Another woman. No men. Find someone who will sublet to you. Pick 3 that you like. Meet and interview the person. Ask and answer questions. I did it myself when my last roommates started going thru a divorce and made it unbearable to be home with them. I signed up for shared housing first, and then got on Craigslist. I have a daughter and am a single mom, so I looked for other single moms. My roommate is my best friend now. And our kids get along great. I helped 3 women do the same.  I went with them to meet the renter at a coffee shop by my job and followed to see the room. All 3 are still happy.

But the girl had been sexually molested by 2 of her older half brothers from the age of 5 to 13. I was gonna end the relationship anyways, cause it was becoming manipulative and insecure. But out of curiosity wanted to hear her story (by my own gut feeling I guessed she was somehow abused before, and asked if she was abused. She confirmed, but refused to talk about it. So I just didn't ask until the breakup time) before ending the relationship ""smoothly"".
 
She told everything with ease, did hesitate at first and in the process of talking, but man was she so comfortable talking about it. Basically, her brothers had been forcing her to give them oral, and once her mother caught them during the act and did nothing. I asked her if they ever had intercourse with her, but she denied (told me she would give them BJs, but wouldn't let them frick her). I just couldn't believe this part. But she always used to tell me she was a virgin. So, as I listened to everything I got super emotional and pissed at her family and had a sad look on my face trying to process everything. And would you guess what she did? She laughed at me asking what's wrong as if it was funny. I just broke up with her right there. Felt a lotta guilt after that. Still do, but not so much. 6 months passed still think about what the fuck is happening in this damn world, and how could such a thing happen with a girl I fell in love with.

32807,suckmydickimalady,t2_65ncfql2,"This is a difficult issue, especially since most police don’t take domestic abuse seriously (often times police officers are abusers in their own homes) and with ER’s filled with CoronaVirus patients it’s very difficult to go to the hospital even if you’ve been beaten to the point of bleeding, broken bones, or even a concussion.
At this point most domestic violence shelters are full and waiting lists are long.
But until this is a solidly recognized issue, it will continue to be swept under the rug.
Making a phone call to someone hoping to distract their victimizer from being abusive typically only delays the abuse or worse, causes the abuser to become even more enraged and abusive towards their victim(s).
It’s a slippery slope, but with technology my best suggestion is to record anything abuse possible on your cell phone.  Then contact the police and a domestic violence shelter such as www.domesticshelters.org and find free legal advice and support who can help you even if the police don’t.  But always remember any judge hearing your case for any reason only knows what documentation, including recording provides.  The judge was not present during the incident so get as much solid proof as you possibly can to expedite the legal system getting you &amp; your non-abusive family members to a safe place.
I hope this helps 💜 Stay safe everyone 🙏",1586638131,fn4brz0,t3_fzeck8,/r/domesticviolence/comments/fzeck8/domestic_violence_how_do_we_protect_people_in/fn4brz0/,1,domesticviolence,comment

32809,abiotric,t2_a3us2,"Wow. I feel like we are twins. You are not alone. It’s hard to not get nervous when you know you have to deal with this difficult dynamic, especially when sex is such a big part of relationships. 

I have started therapy for CPTSD and haven’t gotten in another exclusive relationship since, so I’m not sure if I’ve solved it. But one thing that I found helps is to 1. Tell the person that you need to go extra slow. I know I have waited longer to reach the point where I’ll have sex with a guy, so if I’m about to have sex with him, I feel comfortable telling him this. Tell him to not pressure you to sex, but let you lead. But the not pressuring, as in going at your pace, while you practice grounding techniques should help. I saw a separate therapist who specifically focused on sex, and she said having a partner who you feel completely safe with, safe enough to tell this, and understanding and patient enough to prioritize you feeling safe the entire time, and you working through grounding techniques should help a lot.

There’s a book I am meaning to buy after this is all over, recommended on forums that mention this same dissociation during sex, it’s called “Healing Sex” by Staci Haines.

My ex started the same way.  He didn’t get violent until I became pregnant &amp; then he beat me so badly i lost the baby.  Think very seriously about how he’s going to handle your attention going to children &amp; not him.  Also, think very seriously about if you want him to be the person teaching your children that talking things through is a waste of time.

32824,Okuvlig,t2_2mb9f3f7,"Yeah, I am starting to come to terms with the thought that maybe they weren't the right guys for someone like me... I mean, I have always told them in advance. But it is like after the first time having sex they think I was exaggerating when I told them. I think this might be because I am so high functioning in all other areas in my life and the relationship... It's like they cannot compute that in one area I am vulnerable and fragile, and in other I am fully capable and in control of the situation. 

And that kinda makes them the wrong choice for me? But I will only know that after the fact. Because before we have sex for the first time they are all really ok with taking it slow(last guy it took us two months). But then after having sex the first time, he acted like all the others. Clueless and expecting me to say no(which I will never do if I've fully dissociated). And at some points he didn't even take hints, I physically had to remove myself from him and shout ""enough!"" for him to be like: ""Yeah, ok sure! I respect you.""

It's really hard to think that I have to go through this process over and over again. Getting hurt over and over again, until I find someone who is present enough to notice me, patient enough to wait for me every single time, who is willing to put their needs aside(not just say that they will and then don't). 

I want to work through this, and I wanna do it now. I don't wanna lose any more of what life has to offer because of what previous partners have done to me....


I feel like I am answering my own questions by this... It's impossible for me to work through these parts without a stable partner. And those are not easy to find... And I probably should let this be something I work on when I do find that person... 
But also, I don't want to carry all of this in to new relationships... But that is probably just me trying to rush my healing. 

Anyways, it's an incredible relief to hear that I am not alone in these issues... That it's not all just in my head. Thank you for taking the time!

This is a good time for you to get away from this relationship and never look back.  You didn’t destroy her life, she chose to start the fight which destroyed her life!!!  SHE thought about it and SHE made the decision to fight instead if talk through it.  Give her full credit, she made her choice!  This wasn’t something where she didn’t know what she was doing.  ABUSERS CHOOSE TO BE ABUSIVE!  THEY CHOOSE THIS!!!!  So now is a good time for you to choose to love yourself and leave this relationship.  Contact www.donesticshelters.org and ask them about free legal services in your area &amp; about free counseling and if you’re in need inquire about domestic shelters in your area.

32845,Duhe25,t2_9f0yo,"Listen to my words. 
Breathe.

This sounds like my last relationship. 

I'm going to say a few things that may sound familiar, but just remember that I've been on both sides of this fence. 
Breathe and dont stop taking deep breaths to clear your head. 
For ONCE, do not think of her..
Think ONLY for yourself. 
There is never a time in life that some MAKES us crazy... we make OUR OWN SELF CRAZY. 
She is a adult and is responsible for her OWN actions, even if it is in self defense. She sounds like she has dependency issues. Walk AWAY and TRY VERY hard to not look back. 
You sound like a very broken man. 
You need a hug and a swift kick on the ass to snap out of this. Only YOU can snap yourself out of this. It will make your stomach hurt, it will feel like your breaking more...but you're not. 
You're healing.
And sometimes, that hurts more. To succumb to your actions and take responsibility for the way you have acted. It's a tough journey of self discovery. YOU chose how you get through this, YOU CHOSE HOW YOU LIVE... and how you laugh.. even though it's hard. It's your turn now. 
Start making these choices for you and clear your head before your anxiety kills you. 
You HAVE to clear your head to see what you just wrote, because the answer is in there... you just cant see it until you have calmed down. I can tell you all day what it is, but you wont do it until you take these baby steps that I just explained.

33304,According-Peace,t2_5dutljoj,"I think you need to read ""why does he do that"" by lundy Bancroft. Because abusive men do not have anger management issues. As another poster said, if he really lost control why doesn't he lose control with other people, just you two when you are alone? Why does it happen regularly and why is it escalating? 

Therapy actually makes abusive men worse normally because it is not about anger. It is about control and manipulation is a big part of that. Him saying he knows it's wrong and acting guilty and talking about it with you means the more self aware he acts the more he can get away with doing it. He is using his jekyll and Hyde persona to distract your attention from his actions because you choose to believehos words.

The therapy will allow him to control you more. Read the book, please, it is written by a man with extensive experience working with abusive men.

I left my abusive partner and he's trying to get me back. I still entertain it, we live across a country border so with quarantine we can't see eachother and he can't come to me as he doesn't have a car or visa so I feel uniquely safe. But I don't trust his words only his actions. Yes I miss the good parts of our relationship but when I broke up with him and told him his behavior was why he tried to make excuses, deflect it onto me, he said he'd stop which he's said in the past, he begged, he blamed. I tried to get him to read books about abuse so he would see why I can't trust his words but he didn't read them, showed him checklists for how to see an abusive man is changing but he thought i was taking too long to forgive him and ""not letting shit go"". In really confronting and trying to enforce my boundaries and demand what I wanted in the relationship I just saw how selfish he is and how he managed to get me to compromise my desires and standards many times. Create space for yourself. you need to not live with him. Don't trust his words. And because he seems quite manipulative and good at tricking you and because he is escalating I don't think you can ever believe him again. Leaving will be tricky. You may need to gather a few essentials and leave them at a friend or families then go there after work or the store and not come home. Don't let him know where you are. Open up to others about his behavior so you will feel they are less understanding of you trying to make it work. Be aware it's possible not everyone will be helpful but try to go to those you trust.

He will get worse but also recognize it's already bad enough
He hit you with asparagus. You have to live a life where you tell others that and apologise saying I know it sounds silly. You have to explain why he's like that, you have to try to explain the fear, the humiliation, the pain of trying to help him, of not being sure you if you should leave him, your loyalty, your fighting for it, all in private. Your entire life and mental space is sucked up by protecting him and hiding his behavior, trying to justify and change him, listening to his excuses. That's what abusers do. They control you, suck up all the energy, make everything about them, because you feel obligated to try to fix the relationship for love. He has your entire life right now under his thumb.",1586546733,fn0qca3,t1_fmixtyd,/r/domesticviolence/comments/fvjrsg/my_boyfriend_is_occasionally_abusive_and_i_dont/fn0qca3/,1,domesticviolence,comment
33305,tittychittybangbang,t2_640zcgrc,"Because long term abuse in any form is an extremely powerful manipulation tool, is insidious and can often be undetected for weeks, months or years. 

During this time the person being abused will experience levels of psychological trauma that will physically impact their psyche and how their brain processes ordinary, every day interactions, and they will become ‘trauma bonded’ with the abuser to the point where they are no longer able to recognise the abuse for what it is.

Once the person has been freed from the abuse they may look back on this time and see patterns in the behaviour of their abuser, they may remember parts of the abuse and be repulsed or sent into a psychological break due to repressed emotions and not being able to reconcile what happened with themselves, normally due to immense guilt and self loathing.

This is where things like PTSD come in. 

TL:DR: Abuse is a strong form of manipulation that has been proven to do lasting psychological damage to the victim, often altering their behaviour and views.

Solid, legally collected documentation is the only way to have redress against abusers.  They are consummate actors and liars, and are usually believed over their victims who are stressed and often appear agitated.  I've heard of a number of cases where the abusive spouse will deliberately provoke their ""loved one"" into a conflict that is so diabolical that their spouse cannot help but react angrily, only for the narc to surreptitiously record them and then show this ""evidence"" to the judge.   Make sure you have a lawyer that fully understands how to deal with Cluster B's and who also doesn't  to allow conflict to escalate in order to rack up billable hours.

I can say this because my family was in this exact situation over 1 year ago. Unfortunately, my brother's partner took his life. The one thing I go back to is, if we had truly known the situation, if he had told us about his fear, we could have helped him make different decisions the night he was killed. Encourage your sister to call a domestic violence hotline and just start with talking to someone. Love should not hurt, love should not cause fear, love should not leave bruises on your body. 

If interested, listen to this song and then please share it with her. I wrote the lyrics last year after my brother was killed. Silence can be just as damaging as the physical violence and my mission, in my brother's honor, is to try to get this message out to as many people as possible.

33333,ImYesILeffHisAss2398,t2_2egrzrvq,"&gt;Why am I so stupid? Why do I love him so fucking much? I know about trauma bonds and stuff; I see a therapist... I just can't put that knowledge into practice for some reason.

You arent stupid. You dont actually love the real him. As to what all this means, yes, trauma bonding, etc. What that looks like is drug addiction, the abuser the drug, with brainwashing and conditioning behavior. People that are hooked on heroin know heroin may cost them their job, their home, their family, their health, and even their life. But they still want that heroin. Getting clean is Hell. And sometimes I think this is even worse because people understand someone is hooked on drugs. They dont get that in the context of a relationship. 

It doesnt make sense to outsiders. They dont understand why it takes on average 7 attempts to leave an abusive relationship. Why if you know they are violent that you would good back. The truth is that abusive relationship suppress your logic, grab you by your emotions and swing you to super high highs, and drag you down to terrible lows. They keep you in a state of high anxiety swinging from dopamine and endorphins up and down back and forth. 

It also means you are conditioned to have poor coping skills so that when you get away and you go through that very real withdrawal (and its physical as well as mental) you reach for the abuser to sooth your stress, fear, anxiety, insecurities, etc. Thats because they want you to stay with them, not leave. Even when they caused all of that stress, fear, anxiety, etc. You reach for that fake love, or the crumbs of what you want to think is love but yet never shows up. They need a victim to abuse. 

You are not as bad as a violent, abusive, manipulative abuser. You dont just wake up one day and decide, ""hey, I want to be abused"" and go look to find an abuser. Its a process, a slippery slope you get pushed down by the abuser where your self esteem, confidence and boundaries get eroded so that the abuser controls you emotionally. Abuse gets normalized. Soon, its just a normal Tuesday with the abuse. 

Then you add in things like PTSD, CPTSD, etc and it gets even more difficult. You have been deeply traumatized over a long period of time. You really want your therapist to be a trauma therapist to help you. Abuse goes deep and erodes who you are to your core. Its a process. That love you feel isnt love, its the product of the trauma bond where you brain processes your addiction to the abuser as being love. 

So keep with the therapist. Read some books like ""Why Does He Do That"" by Lundy Bancroft. Its a good one to start with, and there are many podcasts and videos (Dr Ramani is a great one to dig into) to start to break down what you are seeing happening and put it into objective terms. Give them a try. Also Richard Grannon.

To reconcile he needed to show genuine remorse and concern for my hurt, putting his own feelings aside, to show that he learned from his mistakes and realized that he *fucking traumatized me* (yay PTSD). He, of course, never met my unspoken criteria. So I cut him off again.

At the end of the day this is much bigger than you, this is about the safety and well-being of your children and you know that. 

You love your children, you would kill for them *or* be killed for them. Well guess what, if you stay in this relationship those are two very real possibilities. 

Option A. You stay. Your children grow up to witness their mother be beaten, berated and generally abused on a daily basis. They are terrified of their father and of what he might do to you. He turns on them and they become victims of his abuse alongside you, meaning they either go into care or run away from home (unlikely as they won’t want to leave you) or absolute worst case. He kills you, or them, or all of you, be it by accident or deliberately. Your children grow up motherless and suffer debilitating mental health. Or, you eventually leave but the damage has already been done, your children hate their father for what he did, and resent you for letting it happen. 

Option B. You never stop fighting to leave. You tell yourself repeatedly that this man does not love you or your children and that all of you are in danger. You look into the different resources available to women in your position, dedicate yourself to training your mind to understand what has happened to you and what is happening to you, because understanding it brings you one step closer to leaving. Learn to accept what you cannot change. Give yourself over to the idea that you DO NOT need this man, and your children DO NOT need this man.

33826,ImYesILeffHisAss2398,t2_2egrzrvq,"I would go to the police station and make your own report about her abuse. Before she gets there and makes a big one up that you are stuck defending against. So yes, you should absolutely expect her to make police reports or claim victim hood. In your police report, be sure to include other instances of abuse in the past since I doubt this is the first one. Be sure to include that she blocked your exit, refused to allow you to get your clothes and dress, and invaded your privacy. You need to protect yourself here. Abusers are not known for taking responsibility for their actions. She could also try to come back and pull you back into place. Having no contact and even requesting a restraining order is a good choice. They will say anything to get you back with them so they have you in place. Its normal to just want this all over with here. However, it doesnt actually work out that way in real life. So protect yourself. Make a police report. Request a restraining order. And have absolutely no contact with her at any time. If she comes to your home, call the police. Do not open the door. If she chases you down at work, make a police report about that too. Having police reports filed may also protect your job from her harassment. It also tends to quiet down much of the reach they have to strangers and others. Police reports show you will take this seriously and put up boundaries. So dont speak to her if you are in the same space, leave. File reports about each and any time she harasses you.

33847,throw_informexpil,t2_66b1y2ef,"Thank you so much for your reply. I now think I should have mentioned in my original post (should I edit it?) that he is on the autism spectrum, which for him means that he has severe trouble dealing with emotional situations that he has not encountered before. He has not received counseling for this in the past as both him and his family did not deem it necessary as he seemed to be doing fine in life. 

As he is still in his twenties, I think there still exists an opportunity for him to learn about relationships and how to resolve conflict and deal with emotional situations in a healthy way. I do think there was a huge component of him actually lacking the ability to deal with the situation. To clarify: that might explain part of it, but doesn't make it any less wrong. I also think he would take part in counseling if people important to him (his parents) told him this was important to do, as they were still a very big influence on his decisions when we were in a relationship and I don't think that has changed. What his parents would think of him was also the reason why he did not want me to tell them at the time. I don't know that is still the case for certain as I have stayed No Contact and am generally very glad he isn't part of my life anymore. As I had gotten to know his parents quite well, I am also convinced that if I would speak to one of them about this they would try to convince him to seek appropriate counseling and help him in the process. 

I do understand that this might be a quite naive view. When looking at statistics about abusers changing behaviours it is certainly very unlikely it will have any impact. I just feel that in this specific case there exist an opportunity for a change, however small. 

I fully agree with your comments about being an adult and making your own decisions, however, a person is not an island. We all get influenced by the people around us that can make us see things we hadn't seen before. 

Even with all this said, your comment did pull me way more towards the side of not informing them and made me realize that I might need to accept that there is no way for me to prevent others getting hurt by him in the future.

As to being on the spectrum, I still dont know how much they would or could do for an adult (even in their 20s). Being on the Spectrum doesnt make someone an abuser. And if they dont have the ability to identify their need for help if they cannot process their emotions, unless they are under guardianship, Im not sure how parents can force that. 

If you feel that you arent in danger of this sending a wrong message to the abuser and bringing them back into your life with harassment and stalking (people that do not understand emotions and are abusive can become obsessive and stalk) that would of course be up to you.

34315,silentraibow,t2_2ectq76c,"It is hard and especially when your child begins to act like them. Tbo that right there is what hurt the most because I felt that it was them mimicking behavior they saw. This behavior came from my partners home because I now see the abuse that shows over there. My in laws are strange ducks. They have a fave grandkid and don’t care to show it. For example, they would bend over backwards for their other grandkid to help the other mom out but not for my kids. I would ask if they could please take care of my kids so we could go out for a bit (I seldom went out) and they’d either reluctantly say yes or say no. Because of stuff like that I just figured things out on my own but then they didn’t see my kids as often since they never asked to hang out w them or do things. Now they see them a couple times a year even though they live about 20 mins away yet they say I keep them away 🤷🏻‍♀️. When my kids go over I can hear how they try to put negative thoughts in their head and now I just feel like I’m kind of glad they don’t have a closer relationship w then because I see the toxicity there. That’s where I feel the kids pick up abusive behavior more than anything so not like it’s hereditary or anything.

I'm sorry, but if you studied domestic violence issues for 12 years, how could you have missed that choking (and yes he did choke her she has bruises on her neck) is the one biggest indicator that the abuser will kill their partner in future? Should she really wait until it ""happens again""? What if the next time it happens he will hurt her permanently?

I don't want to be condescending. But the advice you give here is against everything that I ever learned about domestic abuse. (And not just from books, sadly.) It is NEVER just that *one* time. There is always the *first* time.

It will not less of a tragedy if the reason this man attacks her is because he has ""psychological issues"". She will still be hurt. Or dead eventually. (He didn't just slap her across the face, he choked her and broke her bone!)

I was a daughter in similar scenario, only it started going bad when I was older, about 13 I think when I picked up just how bad it was.

The likelihood that an abuser will change is very small. They first have to accept all responsibility for their own behavior. Not “If you hadn’t done .....” or “But did it too...”. Total responsibility. Then they have to really want to change and make a long term commitment to do so. The statistics are disheartening, less than 10% will change (and some say as low as 5%).

34838,KatiePossible,t2_16sh4y,"Unfortunately, the bio-dad of my three sisters (my ""ex-stepdad"") is a bit of a dead beat. The youngest spends time with him, the older two want pretty much nothing to do with him. He won't even look at me when he drops-off/picks-up the youngest...(and he was my step dad for nearly 20 years)

Children's aid (I'm in Canada) was invovled and I was the kinship guardian, until my mother ""came back"" last fall (as I said, she continued to see him and ended up leaving again) and children's aid shut the file. I'm reluctant to go to them again, as they were not helpful at all - just a lot of unproductive home visits to make sure I was properly caring for the kids.

As of now, my plan is to stay here for one more year. The 18 y/o is moving out to Uni in Sept. (pending covid) and the 17 y/o has one year of high school left. Once she's done high school, she plans to work so her and I could find a place and the youngest could live with her dad.

34841,ImYesILeffHisAss2398,t2_2egrzrvq,"Abuse is complex, more like addiction with the abuser the drug, and very real brainwashing and conditioning tactics. Breaking through the cognitive dissonance and the trauma bond is very hard. Its on the level with them being a drug addict and crashing with their dealer because it ensures that supply of the drug. Read up on that page for friends and family of victims. What you may think should or would word can actually backfire and isolate the victim from you. All of this is why it takes on average of 7 attempts to leave an abusive relationship. And keep in mind, thats an average. Think about how many take more then 7 attempts to leave, and even then, how many never do. Its terrifying. And you have to keep your mental health up and stay healthy so that you have boundaries to them and dont get hurt constantly by their poor choices. Its a terrible thing on so many levels.

34854,C8H10N4O2xlife,t2_ern2w,"I’m so sorry this is a thing you have to deal with. I haven’t ever experienced this in my family, so I can only sympathize - I follow this sub because when I realized a friend of mine was in an abusive relationship (I had no idea until she called the police) I also sought as much information about what the right thing to do is. How can I be supportive without enabling? Where is the right place to draw the line when my own mental health is suffering? 

The book that I felt helped me the most with this was “Helping Her Get Free: A Guide for Families and Friends of Abused Women”. I wish I had read it sooner - I started reading this when it became clear that my friend was not an exception to the “they always go back” rule.  It explains your options in terms of support and describes what is helpful (supportive statements emphasizing her volition, describing YOUR emotions, reflecting her feelings back to her) and what isn’t (advice and opinions and judgement). It will be harder for you as a direct family member, but it may help you articulate your boundaries. It dramatically changed how I talked to my friend about her situation and I thinks it’s really helpful.

Before I realized she was back with him, I read “Why Does He Do That?” because I had very little experience with DV and felt sort of blind-sided with it. I get the sense you are plenty familiar with what it looks like so idk if this is as useful for you, but it may also help you understand their dynamic and come to terms with her behavior.

One last book by the same author: “Should I Stay or Should I Go?: A Guide to Knowing if Your Relationship Can--and Should--be Saved”. My friend found this book easier to stomach than “Why Does He Do That?” because it’s focused on solutions for her rather than the scarier facts about DV. 

If you get nothing else from this comment, hear this: you are NOT responsible for her choices or the outcomes of those choices. It is not your job to stand by and watch while she is subjected to abuse. You deserve to feel safe and happy. You are justified in being involved at whatever level you decide is right for you and the kiddos you’re raising.

34860,consider-thecoconut,t2_24058slq,"Your welcome. 

Honestly I think back on my time in the shelter fondly...

I went when I was 14 to get away from my abusive mother. My aunt went with me, she had tried letting me come stay with her before but my mom always sent police to collect me as a runaway. So my aunt took me to the womens organization and we told them everything and she was sweet enough to stay with me in the shelter so I wasnt there alone and they let her because i was such a unique situation. They took photos of my abuse for my mom and helped me go to court. It was very weird being there as a teenager as there were no other teenagers, and the kids were so young..so I spoke with the adult women the most. The shelter advised me to stay there and not go to school until court because if I went to school my mom would just get me again. It was a wild time..but a special time and I really learned about a lot, and it was a place I secretly wished I could just stay forever. It was a little scary but the only time I've ever lived with anyone and truly felt safe...

I ended up going to live with my father after that, in another state and he ended up abusing me too. I was so ashamed after all that me and my aunt made a mistake sending me to my dads... I wished I could've stayed with her. I should have. I was so ashamed to tell her of the abuse with my dad after everything I stopped talking to her...

Then my mom left the state that her and my aunt lived in and came back to live near my father and I moved back in with her because my father was worse of an abuser. Then when I moved back in with her she didnt let me speak to my aunt any more but I did have a few secret conversations at first...

When I finished high school I went away to college and didnt live with my mom for a few years which was great...I ended up having to move back in with her for a little while after. She was abusive on and off but not as bad as when I left for the shelter...

Then I moved in with my ex boyfriend and roommates for a few years...or rather (my mom moved out and they moved into our home/apartment with me). 

My boyfriend ended up being abusive too...not super bad he never punched me but he was mean and started throwing things at me and grabbing me and throwing me into walls and yelling and screaming all the time...never listening to me, helping me with things, etc. The last time he did that I was home recovering from a surgery on my abdomen, uterus, and ovaries and he shoved me down and through things at me and screamed in my face. I tried getting him to leave my apartment and he wouldnt.

I wanted so badly to go to a shelter again or to talk to my aunt again but my aunt had passed away and if I left the house he would take over it. Hed take my home my furniture everything out from under me.  So I couldn't leave and it was terrible I had to stay with him in the home for months until I was finally able to get him to move out. It was so hard. I wish I could have gone to a shelter. 

I guess the point I'm getting at is sometimes shelters are really necessary, please dont be afraid to go. And I am so thankful for them and in my darkest moments when I started to relive abuse again I reflected on my time there and almost went to one again.",1586327846,fmrmhij,t1_fmramds,/r/domesticviolence/comments/fwb2sr/shelter/fmrmhij/,1,domesticviolence,comment

You need to play it cool and wait for him to calm down, if you have any reason to leave the house at all tomorrow, like shopping or a docs appointment or any errands I suggest you use that as an excuse and you leave there and then.

Your clothes, shoes and the rest of your personal items can be replaced, but YOU cannot.

My ex used to take my phone or watch me so I couldn’t use it, so if you don’t have access to a mobile wait til you’re out and call a women’s domestic abuse shelter and tell them you’re pregnant. Because of this pregnancy you WILL be a priority, and they will work to put you somewhere safe where he cannot get to you. 

If he doesn’t let you leave the house due to the bruising and he becomes violent again, do what you did before. Protect your belly no matter what. 

Obviously due to the  quarantine situation having a good reason to leave the house will be tricky, is he still needing to work at the moment? Does he leave the house for an hour of exercise a day? If so, this would be a good opportunity.

Guess who controls those beliefs and the way they are presented to the general public? Guess who wrote it all down?  
Men.  
Men who cannot stand to see a woman being her own person.

35303,Up-Town,t2_oi79uhv,"**I feel like it’s not worth it if my fate is sealed.**

Cowboy, your fate is NOT sealed. The reason that the vast majority of abusive people with anger issues do not improve is that -- by their very nature -- personality disorders are invisible to nearly all of the people having them.  This is why PDs associated with anger (e.g., BPD) are said to be ""egosyntonic,"" i.e., are in such complete harmony with the needs and desires of the ego that these dysfunctional issues seem like perfectly reasonable defenses to the people having the PD.

In contrast, you demonstrate here a remarkably high level of self awareness, which is essential to be successful in a program (e.g., DBT) that teaches you the coping skills that enables you to better regulate your own emotions. I therefore encourage you to participate in a program that teaches you those skills. As to the charges against you, if you are found guilty, you almost certainly will have a misdemeanor (not a felony) on your record. Big difference.

By the way, thank you for your service to the community as a firefighter and first responder (who helped people suffering medical emergencies).

Your entire post is about how bad things have been for you, trying to make what you did seem understandable. You cannot put your hands on anyone in a verbal argument. You CAN NOT! I don’t care if she’s a bitch or you just lost your job- abusers always have a reason to abuse. There are no well adjusted abusers with happy lives and good childhoods. You interpreted your anger in a physical way towards your mother and scared her bad enough that she called the police. Unacceptable! Stop excusing it and crying about how hard your life is.

The good news is you can be redeemed. Put in the work to never lose your temper in a physical way again. 

No one can make you hurt them. It is never the other persons fault; if you turn violent you are an abuser. Get therapy, anger management. Do it until you no longer feel like the victim.

I felt like I could completely relate to both of you. I left a 4 year domestic violence relationship when my child was almost 2 years old. So i completely understand where you're coming from as a parent, as a mother. Remember parenting doesn't come with a handbook. Mothers make decisions and sacrifices that a child or a another adult wouldn't understand unless forced to walk in those shoes. So don't beat yourself up. You are doing amazing. 

I was angry with my mom for so long and would call my grandmother crying because I just couldn't understand why..... why she made the choices she made that so drastically changed my life or what I thought my life should be. She would always say ""You'll understand when you become a mother"". Here I am 28 years old and still grasping understanding. I think it's great that your mother is around for her and she has somebody to vent to,because her keeping it in is the scariest part.

I think the conversation is an amazing idea. It may be a very emotional conversation but a much needed one.

You seem to have an understanding of the gravity of the situation and you’ve suffered great consequences. Obviously you were very angry at the time and it’s inevitable that you’ll be angry again at some point. 

We all get angry, it’s how we deal with it that counts. It might be a good idea to explore an anger management course to learn how to better cope with those emotions when they’re running high. 

There is so much hope for you, my friend. I’m sorry that life hasn’t been easy for you. 

Sometimes I find it helps to think of life as like a video game where every year is a new level achieved. I’m currently up to level 42. Every year there will be new challenges to learn to overcome and I congratulate myself for every new level achieved. The higher the levels achieved, the better I get at playing the game. 

Now is not always. This is one moment in time and life has such an enormous unpredictability factor; it’s full of moments and some of those will be so enjoyable. You’ve overcome some gargantuan hurdles and you should congratulate yourself on that. The more you learn, the better you’ll become at the game of life. 

I don’t know you very well but I’m so proud of you for coming this far. Everyone has such great potential and I see an incredible amount in you. 

Life WILL get better. Start working towards your new goals that with the optimism of that knowledge. Just remember that sometimes it gets worse before it gets better. But learning to overcome those challenges is just a learning opportunity to move forward towards all the greatness you have in you.

It cost $85, and I just told them the three addresses I thought my ex could be, what he looked like (down to details, like tattoos and scars). It’s crazy that they found him at the exact address I gave the sheriff. It’s possible his family saw a cop and lied about him being there, but didn’t expect it from someone in plain clothes?

The other thing is that even if the private server FAILS to deliver it, bring the receipt and whatever documents/affidavits they give you to court.

35324,ImYesILeffHisAss2398,t2_2egrzrvq,"I recommend you check with a local abuse agency. Right now, most evictions are not being done and that could last for some time. So without something like a restraining order, which you would likely need to file for and its best to have recent police reports for would be the way they remove him. As you know, CPS wont be coming out to your home right now. And they will likely take action like they did before. So reach out to a local abuse agency. You want him out of the home rather then leaving yourself (especially during a lockdown with COVID19), and that really requires eviction (which takes time to break their legal rights of tenancy) or a restraining order which requires probably more evidence then old reports. So talk to your local abuse agency. Talk to a lawyer. You can also check out the links to the COVID19 resources here, and please check out the resources for COVID19 on this page (takes you to a document listing San Diego direct resources) [HERE](http://www.sddvc.org/).",1586208249,fmmmyzv,t3_fw5cb3,/r/domesticviolence/comments/fw5cb3/how_can_i_get_the_abusive_drug_addict_father_of/fmmmyzv/,1,domesticviolence,comment
35325,ImYesILeffHisAss2398,t2_2egrzrvq,"When people say ""Please No Judgement"" here its usually because they want to stay with their abuser and to find a way to tolerate the abuse so that they can make that happen. Im not judging you for that. I think you know deep down that this can very easily happen again, and it could have cost you your life the first time. Choking is the biggest indicator of intimiate partner death there is. He broke your bones. And alcohol is not responsible. It just isnt. 

As a rule for me, forgiveness, it needs to meet several requirements. First, the person has to actually ask for it, and list everything that happened that they are seeking forgiveness for here without diminishing or excusing what happened. They need to own it and take responsibility for it. Secondly, they have to list out the exact steps they will take permanently to ensure it never happens again. Third, they have to take those steps and adhere to that request permanently. Fourth, they cannot rush you or demand forgiveness if it takes longer then they are willing to wait for you to come to forgiveness. None of these things have happened yet other then the expectation of forgiveness from the abuser here.

As to forgetting, you will never ever forget what he did to you. You have been traumatized, had bones broken, and been traumatically abused by a person you loved and trusted. Thats never going to go away. And you need to deal with the effects of that trauma, even if you dont want to do that. I recommend you find a qualified therapist experienced in treating victims of abuse (yes, you are a victim of abuse, its not blowing the term out of proportion, he broke bones and left horrible bruises). They can help you to come to terms with the trauma. Ignoring it or down playing it will not make it go away, it will just magnify the trauma to show up bigger. 

I know you want to believe this was two different people, but its not. Its him. 100% him. Alcohol isnt the person that broke your bones. Him crying at the hospital, if you want to see it as something ""nice"" you can, but at the same time, please realize that it could be just him crying for effect. I have very very very major doubts that this is the first time and only time hes ever abused you. It may be the first time you were willing to call it abuse and not excuse other behavior issues. I recommend you check out thehotline.org and read about what abuse is, look at the power wheel, etc. Because hes not here looking for ways to make this better. You, the victim, are here wanting to do the work that the abuser should be doing here. Not him. 

Someone that was really sorry would likely immediately talk about therapy for you, and for them. Its only been a few months since that happened and you even talk about  how he wanted to drink again. I know you just want to ignore all of this and pretend it never happened so you can have the marriage. We all want a happily ever after. But this isnt going to be it for you. That reaction of wanting to ignore this and hope for the best really sounds like someone whose been abused before.",1586209074,fmmoilm,t3_fw0wc1,/r/domesticviolence/comments/fw0wc1/is_it_ok_to_forgive_and_forget_about_what_happen/fmmoilm/,3,domesticviolence,comment
35326,ImYesILeffHisAss2398,t2_2egrzrvq,"Abusers dont abuse you because you earn it or deserve it. They are abusers because they need to abuse for whatever reason. Perhaps they enjoy the feeling of power and control over you (in the way you would feel love). Perhaps they need someone to dump all their emotions into so that they dont have to deal with it themselves and use you like a trash can to vomit it all away. Perhaps they grew up that way. No matter what, they are abusers and you are their victim. And abusers recycle victims when they need that outlet and dont have enough of one at the time. That includes when they are trying to reel in a new victim and expending lots of energy and not able to do what they want yet so they go back to you. And being locked down in quarantine takes lots of opportunities for what they want away. So they turn to social media, email, texts, calls, etc to make it happen. They dont do boredom well.

The procedure was you go to some sort of intake thing at an office space, and then they decide if you will be placed there and how to proceed. Then they escort you to take you or show you the way, whatever, to the safe house. It is typically very secretive so abusers dont find out where it is. 

The one I was at had women and children. I was in  a room with 2-3 other beds and some dressers, all shared with other single women no children. I'm not sure what the rooms were like for the ones with kids. 

There were rules like curfew, no visitors (obviously so no one could leak info to an abuser), showers were timed cause there were so many people, house chore stuff was like shared on a board. There was a computer and books and a living area..I think computer time was timed since everyone shares. Once a week they'd bring clothes donations over and everyone would go through it and try stuff on etc. Food was all donated, they had toiletries donated.

They also have a caseworker there at all times that helps go over your incidences, protection plan, what you should be doing, setting up stuff with legal aid and court if you're going to go to court, etc. I used all of that and got free legal support and got to go to court.

It was a little chaotic there cause there was a lot of kids, women in all sorts of situations and mental states...some were physically battered and had swollen faces which is a little scary.

But overall it was a pretty comfortable place all things considered and it sort of felt like some sort of completely off kilter boarding for battered women and one of the few places where it was raw and open about that sort of stuff. And it was a step towards something different.

I dont know how it changes from shelter to shelter or between countries but that was my experience.",1586239017,fmnydc8,t3_fwb2sr,/r/domesticviolence/comments/fwb2sr/shelter/fmnydc8/,1,domesticviolence,comment

35367,pavlovs_conditioner,t2_4d6tpevu,"I can't tell you what the experience is like in Canada. I can only speak for the experience in Los Angeles, CA. I am a therapist and work at a domestic violence shelter. 

From the outside, the shelter looks like any regular home. Many in the community don't know it's a shelter. It's very secure - gate, camera system and staff on site 24/7. When you walk inside, you are greeted by staff that just wants to help. The inside should be very clean. Most shelters are inspected by local health departments, so it's clean and safe for you and the staff that works there. The inside is also furnished like a regular home. We have a living room, a dining room, a kitchen, a backyard, fronted and separate bedrooms. Each bedroom is decorated so that it looks cozy and welcoming. You might share a bathroom with another family, but you get the bedroom to yourself and your child. 

As for the services you receive- at the shelter I work in, we provide therapy, support groups, case management, parenting support and legal advocacy. These are all ways we support you. Of course, we cannot fix everything, but we can give you guidance and information on resources that can help you. We empower you to make your own decisions. We will never decide for you, which is actually daunting to a lot of survivors. We help you learn to feel confident in making choices for yourself. 

There are communal chores. Some of our clients hate this part. Most enjoy using cleaning time to distract themselves. Sometimes, you might not get along with the other families in the shelter. But so long as you focus on your case and your goals, those petty problems can be shut out. It's not easy and the reality of being in shelter is not all fine and dandy. Some days, you will be triggered - be it by staff or other residents. Some days, you'll be surprised by the empathy and compassion from people you never imagined meeting. You may also be surprised by how your child reacts to the new environment. She may lash out, finally be able to be a child and Express all the anger and rage she must be feeling from seeing her mother suffer. You may also your child blossom. She may become more social, expand her vocabulary, throw less tantrums. 

All in all, going to shelter is never going to be an easy decision. And at the same time, you may be thanking yourself and wondering why you didn't make the choice sooner. 

My best advice is that you call a local DV hotline and ask what a regular day at their shelter looks like. Wishing all the strength and wisdom to help you make the decision that is best for you and your child.",1586239577,fmnyz41,t3_fwb2sr,/r/domesticviolence/comments/fwb2sr/shelter/fmnyz41/,1,domesticviolence,comment

35378,SaltyWiring,t2_4v3nmm0s,"It's not your fault. Nothing you did would ever justify his behavior. I know it hurts and it's incredibly confusing when a close family member blames you for your abuser's behavior. My mother blamed me for ""putting myself in that situation"" and tells me not to talk about what I went through, or how bad the trauma affected me. She was physically abusive when I was growing up, so I drew a parallel with both her and my partner's abusive behavior very fast. 

Reaching out to a domestic violence counselor, help line or shelter helped immensely. I had even moved out, had my just gotten my new place, had a great new job and was hundreds of miles away from my abuser- but was still a train wreck because of my mother's victim-blaming. I called the local domestic violence shelter and they were phenomenal about getting me the help I needed even though I didn't need to stay at the shelter(I you feel unsafe that is still a good option.  If I had been in danger they would have moved me in ASAP). I got a legal advocate, counseling, a huge support system of women that had been through what I had been through and could help me handle my mother's behavior in a manner that was healthy for me as well as my abuser's behavior. I would really urge you to give your local shelter a call. I promise, you're not alone on this.

He’s already showing you his true colors &amp; you’re not even married yet!
Call the police and report being hit with an object even tho it was asparagus, it doesn’t matter.  You want documentation.  Because he’s going to stalk you if you try to leave, so you want proof to provide the judge to get a restraining order.
Then go to your doctor or urgent care (because all of the ERs are dealing with CoronaVirus right now) &amp; have them check you out.  Again, this is for documentation.
You will need all the documentation you can get &amp; it’s difficult to get it if you’re not proactive about it.
Finally contact www.domesticshelters.org &amp; let them know your situation, they specialize in getting help for people in domestic violence situations free of charge.  
But you need to leave this abuser!
In the 3 years I’ve spent working with &amp; helping dv victims since I was victimized, not one single victim has ever experienced their abuser stopping the abuse.  Every single victim has said &amp; proven their abuser only ever gets more &amp; more abusive!

35809,antm222,t2_64rgjudi,"I must admit, we do talk about this an awful lot and when he's his normal rational self he knows that this is all crazy and wrong and he shouldn't react like that about simple things, he just can't seem to help it although I know that's not an excuse and so does he. I think that's the hardest thing about it all, it's not him when he's acting like that, it's like a Jekyll and Hyde thing that he can't control and knowing that, and knowing the person he really is, which is good, makes leaving him so much harder.

35821,ImYesILeffHisAss2398,t2_2egrzrvq,"I just want you to know that abusers dont abuse 100% of the time. Thats a misconception of abuse. Abuse isnt because they cant control themselves or have a ""anger management problem"" which is why there is a 96% recidivism rate for abusers in anger management programs. They can and do control it so that they arent abusing their boss, their friends, and others they want to see the best side of them. They certainly can control it in order to convince you to date them. And abuse will escalate. 

Abusers do have times when they do good things and nice things for others. However, that good stuff does not somehow cancel out the bad in some math subtraction problem. You cant fix them. You cant change them. And the idea that they are ""perfect"" outside of this abuse is part of how they keep you in place. You are going to be seeing many other ways that ""perfect"" isnt real as it continues. 

Thats because abusers wear masks, they project the qualities they think you want to see in order to pull you into place in the trauma bond. What you never want to do is call them out or confront them with this because that can be dangerous. Reach out to your local abuse agency. Quietly. Talk to them. There are many listed in the COvID19 FAQ in our sub. Dont change your behavior. Dont confront them. 

And that dirty secret? The past partners know about it too. They have experienced it too. They were convince it was just a anger problem and could be changed too.",1586123774,fmj62r4,t3_fvjrsg,/r/domesticviolence/comments/fvjrsg/my_boyfriend_is_occasionally_abusive_and_i_dont/fmj62r4/,1,domesticviolence,comment
35822,_silly_billy_,t2_5u0vj63q,"I'm so sorry you are going through this. You've spoken about him getting help to understand his anger problems, and I think it shows how kind you are that you're supporting him, but please can you consider the following: Are his outbursts towards lots of people or just you? Is he ever aggressive towards objects when he is alone? When he breaks stuff, is it your stuff or his stuff that gets broken? If he really loses control, then why does he stop when he stops? If he really draws the line at hitting you with his hands, and he's managed to suppress that urge due to his morals, then is it fair to say that he thinks it is on some level morally acceptable to treat you how he's been treating you?

Please also consider that once every month is regular, not occasional, and so far the evidence shows he is getting worse. Why would he put you at risk whilst his problem is getting worse. If I acted that way towards someone I loved, I would insist on time physically apart whilst I work on my issues - why hasn't he done that to you?

I was/am in a similar position to you and a book that has really helped me is 'Why Does He Do That' by Lundy Bancroft. There is a free copy on the internet if you type it in google followed by 'pdf'. Please, please read it when you can. It's very helpful and can help you to understand your situation more clearly. It will also explain why counseling doesn't work. It is best, though, not to let your boyfriend know that you read it.

I've never used DV services but I have heard they're very helpful for others. It is likely that if he marries you or gets you pregnant, he will become worse because it will be harder for you to leave him. Contacting them now, before it gets even worse, will be helpful.

Please also consider that this reddit community is FULL of people who have experienced DV and I haven't heard of a single person here who has successfully managed to get their partner to change, but they have all tried.

Good luck and all the best to you",1586127614,fmjcnn9,t3_fvjrsg,/r/domesticviolence/comments/fvjrsg/my_boyfriend_is_occasionally_abusive_and_i_dont/fmjcnn9/,1,domesticviolence,comment

35829,Beth_T_Hunter,t2_64dn8ohw,"I’m sorry, I wasn’t trying to be the barer of bad news.  It just been my experience.  For nearly a year after I woke up from the coma I had hope that he would realize how close to death i had been and that he would change.  So I completely understand the hopes &amp; desires to make things work &amp; that he will understand and see the light and want what’s best for the relationship.  But to this day, my ex-husband still posts on Facebook that everything that happened was “All his wife’s fault &amp; she had no right to mention a divorce.”  Plus a few swear words he continuously adds.  Unfortunately, i just haven’t heard or met anyone who can attest to their abuser ever stopping the abuse, even after counseling.  I’m sorry, I just want you to be safe.  It can quickly go from a slap to the face to choking to a weapon being involved.  Even if he’s never slapped you before, it just happens sooo quickly &amp; it’s soooo difficult to even come to grips with the fact that it happened.  It took me about 6 months and some counseling to admit to myself that my ex tried to murder me.  It’s difficult to come to terms with it, let alone explain it to others.  No normal person expects someone who claims to love them to deliberately harm them.  People forget that what you’re feeling is a normal reaction to someone who is a controlling abuser who most likely would be diagnosed by a psychiatrist as having a major personality disorder.  What you are feeling is completely normal!!!  Just stay safe &amp; start preparing yourself with safety plans.  If you gave neighbors you trust, give them a heads up.  Open a new e-mail address that only you know about &amp; take pics if your driver’s license, ssi card, birth certificate, credit cards, etc and send those pics to that email address.  Keep your phone with you at all times &amp; when he starts acting up, start recording &amp; call 911 asap.  Prepare a bag that you can keep at a friends/families house or in a locker at the gym with extra clothing and toiletries &amp; essentials in case you need to run spur the moment.  If you do end up running, DO NOT GO BACK TO HIM!!!  75% of women who go back to their abuser are murdered by their abuser!  75%!!!  Believe me, IT IS HARD AS HELL TO STAY AWAY &amp; GO NO CONTACT!!!

I think in whatever conversation you should apologize to her that you weren't able to protect her, and try at all costs not to be defensive.

35839,cbradio69,t2_334yrl30,"He hit you with the asparagus because it’s humiliating. He’s seeing how far he can go bit by bit. But humiliation is a part of it. My abuser was one of my best friends and we were very close when we began quietly dating. Once I fell in love
And he lost his job, the abuse began slowly with an angry outburst after we had sex for 5 hours and he couldn’t finish. We were very sexual and passionate. I was engulfed. 

A few weeks later he shattered all my wine bottles on my shared driveway and trashed my room. He posted a video on his Instagram (not his story - an actual post) from 4am-6am of me, insinuating drug use. Complete disregard for all I had worked for in my life (bachelor’s, career, family, etc.). Then he started to use my body to trash my room. Then he began to choke me. I really can’t remember all the attacks as they became more violent. Still healing. But the first time he finally got arrested for assaulting me, he grabbed the leftovers I had brought from my parents house in a Tupperware container, emptied the food out onto my living room floor, and among many other terrible things he did that usually only left bruises, he yelled at me to get on the ground and clean it up with my face/mouth. I refused, so he pulled me to the hardwood floor by the grip of my hair and I hit my head on something on the way down. I was bleeding everywhere and was so happy there was real evidence since no one had really believed me. He is a very convincing person. 

I escaped by a thread, distracting him with access to my phone pretending he was going to find something really bad. I found out later he had a plan to bound me to a chair and torture me in the apt building’s basement in which only myself and my inactive landlord had access to. Who knows if I would’ve lived. I didn’t really live anyways after..  even though I survived. I was super in love and still am a bit. The grip of trauma bonding is so incredibly strong and blinding (I didn’t learn that term until 6 months of no contact- google it today). 

A few years later he was holding me hostage at another apartment of mine. The food humiliation again: He shattered a large ceramic bowl of frosted mini wheats &amp; milk I had just prepared for him on my skull. Before it took me out and he kicked me a few times, I remember my first emotion initially was humiliation. 

I was covered in soggy cereal as he told my mom, who I called when I escaped the apartment, that I made it all up. Just like all the other attacks, like when I cut myself in the head with a box cutter, he said. Since I was losing my mind because of all the things he did to my life over three years, she said she might’ve been convinced by him that I was creating scenarios. I had been such a mess for so long and was coping via a Benzo addiction.

However, and luckily, I had security cameras in my apartment which he “slipped” and momentarily forgot about.
The attack was recorded and saved to various clouds as soon as I remembered the cameras were on. This video is the reason he left my life finally and I haven’t spoken to him since (14 months now). The video could also be the reason an abuser would kill their victim as well. It’s really hard to say what works once you’re in the situation but the best thing is to prevent this situation from happening to you. 

I would do anything to go back to your stage of my abusive ex relationship and shake myself and read all of the experienced advice to run. It will get worse. Even if he did not abuse an ex, neither did mine. Even if he is amazing and you are so in love. A civil protection order for the max of 5 years never once stopped my abuser. Getting away with their crimes inflated their egos and makes things so much worse for the victim. It was almost like mine was working with the police. I have found this injustice BS is common, though. It’s very painful to feel such injustice. To be victim-blamed by those who are supposed to protect you. To also, deep inside, believe that your abuser can get away with anything.

The humiliation factor here as well the way you defend him (you did nothing wrong, you are a good woman and may be an empath as well; I once defended mine the same way but this is a classic sign of a potentially abusive situation) are both huge red flags, besides the obvious ones. I know you don’t want to hear this and it’s the worst possible scenario it seems, but you will regret not leaving. 

I can’t even begin to articulate the suffering you will endure for your entire life if things go further.. The complex PTSD, among so many other life-shattering effects of being a victim of intimate partner violence, especially by someone manipulative and covert.. it’s all just so so hard. It’s excruciating. It doesn’t get better easily. You want to be glad you weren’t murdered but you don’t have any self esteem or identity or in some cases, any support after a while, and you don’t know what to be happy for. This is a dark place that should be avoided. Do all you can to avoid becoming this.

By the way,  I kicked the drug use about 8 months post-“no contact” after the local cultural magazine featured him and his street art as their cover story. It all became too much to bare and I was afraid of dying. Not sure how I made it through and how I am making it through without suppressing my pain with drugs. But I’m doing it. 

Please take our advice and leave the safest way possible. Make a plan, protect yourself in all the ways you can. The longer you wait, the harder it will be to do so.

Secondly, those resources you’re talking about are 100% meant for you. Please don’t feel like you’re wasting anyone’s time or taking a resource away from someone else. I know when I went through an emotionally and mentally abusive relationship I certainly thought the same, but it’s not about who has it worse, at the end of the day it’s still abuse and that’s what those resources are there for.

I remember the police I called to my house one night offered to link me in with some domestic violence support and I very vaguely remember saying something along the lines of “but he didn’t hit me or anything” and these incredibly lovely police very kindly explained to me that mental and emotional abuse are still abuse and I would be more than welcome to speak with one of their people. 

It still took me an incredibly long time to speak to anyone about it, so I know where you’re coming from with the hesitancy, but just because someone else has had both their legs chopped off doesn’t mean your chopped off hand hurts any less. Sometimes talking to someone close to you is far more intimidating than speaking with a stranger about these things too, keep that in mind.

I’ve been out of that situation for 3 and a half years now and it was only a 6 month relationship itself. I still think about it and it still sucks a lot, but it’s not all the time and I’ve come further than I ever thought possible.

36324,metalman675triple,t2_5nwcoajm,"Recording laws vary by state.  NC for example is a ""one party"" state, so as long as one person knows about the recording they don't need to ask the other.  Some specify it has to be obvious so no hidden cameras, some require you inform them, in others that's illegal, it depends.  Most are going towards legalization because of law enforcement issues with shootings.

HOWEVER, those laws are really designed so that in a public space (ie beach park ect) you could say record your children and not worry about bystanders, or so that victims aren't afraid to record criminals with security cams ect.

Deliberately recording a person against their will WITHOUT purpose is harassment and stalking in almost every single state.  If a court has ruled to protect you, he likely has lost his right to record you unless you are committing a crime, and if you aren't it now has no legal purpose so it falls under ""monitoring stalking ect"" (in NC for example).

SO my unsolicited non-lawyer hypothetical advice is....
1 show he is recording you
2catch him yelling or harassing you ect
3 subpeona his recording for a protective order (if you already have one simply call the police)
4. He will deny he has one or he will give an edited version. 
5You will then show that he has altered or purposefully shortened his, and prove this with your own full recording

Success!  He has then committed perjury, tampered with evidence, and automatically he has harassed threatened stalked you ect because he has hidden his activity and attempted to lie (if it wasn't illegal why did he hide it?). It also skips the ""oops my bad"" defense that he just didn't know, which yes every court allows because god forbid these fucks just act decent from the get go.

Good luck, and
Document document document

Also, read the laws in your state, seriously just Google ____ domestic violence statutes/laws and start reading.

36339,justpeachy7777,t2_259yfr3,"There are some people who think after someone gets out of a bad relationship (even if they were the one abused) then they deserve to (or should have to) “sit out of life” for a year or more to heal. This is also common after people get divorced. I noticed it in some friends and on this sub.

If you are acting in a healthy manner, seeing a therapist to continue to learn from your time in an abusive relationship, and want to date, then there is no reason for people to be critical about it, in my opinion. Dating is normal and healthy. People heal differently. Hopefully you are not putting yourself in a vulnerable place or unhealthily attached relationship.

There are plenty of previously abused women who meet very nice men within a year after leaving their ex. i think those that do recognize the issues and red flags they missed in that relationship, correct it in the new relationship, and have very low tolerance for any abusive behavior (ie would break up over any red flag). Others swear off dating entirely or for years.

I just wouldn’t bring up your dating life with her anymore until she does &amp; is nice about it. If she says something critical just brush it off and change the subject. 

I do think it is fair for a friend to be skeptical/protective because they are looking out for you, and maybe that is all she means and it is coming across as hurtful to you. So you could say something like: I appreciate you being concerned and watching out for me. I don’t want to make the same mistake again so I hope we can discuss the relationship and you can mention if I’m missing any red flags with him.",1586095269,fmhvxgz,t3_fv4mz9,/r/domesticviolence/comments/fv4mz9/need_advice_best_friend_not_supportive_of_new/fmhvxgz/,1,domesticviolence,comment

He beat the shit out of me, tried to kill me and ran out into the night. Except I didn’t chase him, I just fucking hid in the bathroom. Around dawn, he comes back, kicks the goddamn door in and has another go at me. Police, jail for him, 3-day notice for me. I was homeless for the next 9 months, the entire time we weren’t together, even though I obviously visited him in jail, put money on his books, spent a ridiculous amount on phone calls, even got a room for us when he got out... after a day out, using drugs (we both were on heroin but he’d picked up crack/coke) he broke the window out of the 5th story room we were staying in while he was laying in to me. I gave up at that point, called a mutual friend to come get him because I couldn’t take it anymore. I stayed away for nine fucking months, homeless and barely scraping by... then he ends up getting clean, getting a place, and I wanted that so badly that I got back together with him. He was okay for a little while, but once they hit you I don’t think they ever really see you as a person again, and regardless, once you’ve/I had proven to him he could hit me and I would stay, that was never not on the table for him. Kicked off the next 3-4 years of getting beat up and controlled by him. Getting hit when you’re clean and sober sucks a lot more.

You need to build your boundaries up. Why are you accepting this stuff? He should be blocked on everything.

Everytime he contacts you, send it to the police, everytime!

Of course you may still love him. That is natural and part of trauma bonding, as well. 

Please follow Mark Groves @ createthelove on all social media. He teaches boundaries for all relationships and has made huge changes for people. It's all free too.

As complicated as relatioships can seem, they boil down to a simple reality.

Does my partner meet my needs for:
Safety, security, companionship, respect,  understanding, loyalty, honesty. Do they meet my sexual needs. Can we grow together.

You are more important than any relationship! He is not being honest and heartfelt. He is trying to force you by bullying. This is not love, It's control!

The main concern I have is your view of yourself. You should get into counseling asap and please follow Mark, you will notice changes, in your thinking, in the first week. 

Truth is many guys would never, under any circumstances, treat you that way because they respect themselves too much to lower their behaviour to that point. He is sick and should be avoided at all costs.

Time to put your foot down. Call the police, getcha protection order. When the police serve him, they will notify him if he contacts you he goes to jail. You needed to be 100% following through on that.

36804,kwagenknight,t2_opzwo,"What you went through is terrible and it actually changes your body and mind where it makes you think differently. So even though you may think you love him you really dont and he certainly doesnt know how to love someone either.

Its called Trauma bonding where the lows are followed by extreme highs when they try to apologize and make it up to you and love bomb you. This releases chemicals in your brain that you can crave which is why after time passes you start thinking about them and mainly only about the good times and dont dwell on the bad. Its a pavlovian response and you basically get trained in a sense to want, crave or need that love bombing after an attack.

Read up on Trauma bonding and also on Love Bombing and why they do what they do and what it does to your brain as well as how to look out for that in the future so you can have tools to know what to do by seeing this earlier and get away from those people. IMO knowing the psychology behind these things can really help!

36805,axtumnx,t2_5eb3lvck,"I am a survivor of a narcissistic abuse, in my story I actually left the relationship once because it was too much mentally and emotionally to deal with, i literally had to run away. But I ended up reaching out to him again because I just had a daughter with him. And lead me to going back into the abusive cycle. In that moment of being away I thought I was strong enough to not go back but I was wrong. However, I do not regret it. Six months later something clicked in my head that what I was going through was not okay. And I started researching what ""domestic violence"" was and how to get away safely.

A narcissist will definitely do whatever they can to keep their victim. Even though I was safe with family, and once I returned back to the abuse I had to cut all ties with family. Abuser convinced me that they were bad people and that they do not know ""us"" as a couple nor as parents, therefore, they have no say in how we move forward. But of course there was no bright side and only things got worse.

I think it is amazing that you want to do everything you can, but like my family did for me, they stayed away and prayed to their higher powers, and that is what you will have to do. I hope your friend does find the light and that the ""blinds"" come off and she see's what that man is truly is. I hope she wakes up one day with all the strength she needs to walk away - for good. And when she does I know you will be waiting and that you will be ready to help hear heal. Maybe in the mean time you plan for her safe exit. If she runs to you to be finally done, where can you take her? What resources can you provide? Are there shelters where you are at? 

Also, as someone else recommended, keep track of emails, texts, social media, everything. In my situation my abuser got into all of those things just to find me, at one point he still had access to my email to send himself messages that look like I wrote and gave that to the courts to try and keep custody of my daughter, he is currently doing that with screenshots of text messages. Again, these types of abuser will do whatever it takes to keep control of their victims.

36812,ImYesILeffHisAss2398,t2_2egrzrvq,"Its perfectly normal to feel like you still love your abuser, especially when you still have contact with them. Please contact emergency services in reply to his threats and videos of harming himself. Then block him on all fronts. If he is seriously suicidal (which even abusers can be here) he has the opportunity to take advantage of services directed by the emergency professionals. If he is doing this just to viciously manipulate you back into place as his abuse victim, then he will not get what he wants out of it. And with blocking the abuser, you cut the cord. 

Doing that, blocking them, can send you into a withdrawal like feeling. Its very much physical as well as mental. Abuse can be like addiction, the abuser the drug, and it has brainwashing and conditioning tactics to it. Just like any drug, your brain wants more when the supply is cut off. Even when logically this seems unbelievable, abuse works on emotions and suppresses logic. Then it causes your emotions to be yanked up for super high highs and terrible low lows. 

It also gets you to feel responsible and accountable for taking care of their physical and emotional needs, because they dont want to do that themselves. So you feel guilty, like you need to do something to help them. And thats completely intentional. 

You are not a mental health professional and cant help him any more. Blocking them is a great start. But then you need to follow up with a therapist specifically experienced in treating victims of abuse. They offer objective guidance, support and validation while you work through identifying, unpacking and process all of the abuse you have been through. And much of it was normalized as it went along because thats how abuse works. 

They way you are feeling is a very normal reaction in a very abnormal and healthy situation. That deep connection was intentionally manufactured through the course of abuse. So take action to help yourself get free. Call emergency services, block them, and reach out for a therapist. Turn your focus and energy back on you where it can do some good.

36815,arctxdan,t2_9k2gitq,"This reminds me of what I went through with my ex. We were constantly living through unstable and extraordinary times, being homeless together, witnessing violence and taking action together. He carried me when I was sick and advocated for me in the hospital.

This did not change the fact that he regularly stole from me, controlled who I talked to and where I went, accused me of cheating every time I left his sight, and hit me on what became a weekly basis.

However, I had no options. I could either take his good along with his bad, or have no one at all. Going through trauma together, and being traumatized by him, bonded us in an intense and fierce relationship.

**Please do some research on Trauma Bonding and familiarize yourself with it.** It was a lightbulb moment for me.

I'm sorry that your friends withdrew their support of you, but realize that it may be out of pure ignorance rather than true distrust or uncaring. If they're important to you, it may be worth it to send them information about trauma bonding too, which will help them understand why your choices were natural and valid, and even *caused by the abuse rather than in spite of it.*

It sounds like you already know that X's A+ behavior recently is a temporary measure to lure you back into his palm. I wish you the best of luck, please take care of yourself, and stay strong without X.

You want a report filed for the purpose of foundation building towards a new restraining order. My guess is the pandemic is driving them to old supply for an outlet. They do like to recycle. 

If you can, reach out to your local abuse agency for help. They may have an advocate there to help you with this. You may also want to get a lawyer. Talk to one. They may be able to help you get the report filed and documented properly. 

However, there arent many other ways for them to have their rights limited (like with a restraining order) or hold them legally accountable outside of a court room or police arresting them. Unfortunately, thats the system in place. So stay respectful, professional, polite, but be forceful in getting the report filed and getting a copy. Keep emotions in check.

Speaking from experience with my husband. It did not change until I filed for divorce and moved out, and only then because he finally committed to therapy. But I was more willing to work through issues because we have children together. I can imagine how your head is reeling after spending that time with him, but anyone can behave for three weeks. How will he carry himself when you’re well and independent? Men like this, on some level, they want to Keep you broken. It makes them feel strong when they pick you back up, even when they were the ones who broke you. It’s sick, and this man is sick. Don’t evaluate him in the context of the last three weeks, evaluate over the course of your relationship. And does he acknowledge that he was abusive? My husband understands that his behavior was abusive and that’s why he has been able to put in the work to change the behavior. You can’t change a trait you are in denial of.

If I were in your situation I would hold him at arms length, if you’re really determined to get back together (my true advice is, don’t! Life is too short but I know the reality is that you will try). If he’s worth it he will wait and put in the work and fight for you while you protect your heart (and stop sleeping with him, this gives him so much power and confuses your heart and head).

37303,jeynesm,t2_rlsqm,"I think firstly try to mentally separate the problems you have into neat groups.

The practical side of your life means money is an issue and you may have priority calls to make between study and making some money.  Given the lockdowns we're all in right now perhaps just accept that money will be tight for a while and best to focus on success in studies because that will pay back in the longer term.

The problem between your father and mother is an emotional one.  It's terribly hard to break a bond you've had with someone over many decades.  They will forever be in your thoughts so that fact can't really change.  But it's likely that your mother needs emotional support from you more than money right now.  Be there for her.  Talk to her as much as you can.  Try to help her see she is not responsible for your father's self-destructive behaviour and she should not allow his self destructive actions to take her down too.

I see someone suggested blocking his number in her phone.  If you do this make sure you discuss it with your mother first and get her to agree to it.  Ask her if she would consider having his number blocked to save herself from the emotional turmoil she is facing - perhaps as a necessary step to manage their final separation.",1585864717,fm9aaau,t3_ftcxj6,/r/domesticviolence/comments/ftcxj6/my_dad_in_asia_is_trying_to_commit_suicide_again/fm9aaau/,1,domesticviolence,comment

If she makes these choices they will not work if she doesnt want them to be made. She has to decide to them for herself, not because you harass her or manipulate her into it. Even if its for her own good. Thats why it takes on average 7 attempts to end a abusive relationship. So read up on thehotline.org on the page for family and friends of victims. And make sure you do not get so involved because it may result in her blocking you.

37307,Tuff-Talk,t2_5hr7lg7,"Several things here:

Stay out of her relationship. There is way too much drama and you will always come off as the bad person. 

You can't change anyone, ever. She needs to step up and make the decision. Your suggesting she get help is the right idea. There are some family services places that have a sliding pay scale based on income.

She didn't pick a guy like that by accident, she has self esteem issues and a lack of boundaries. The best thing you can do is step back. Be there for her but totally leave her relationship stuff to her.

I suggest both of you follow Mark Groves @ createthelove on all social media platforms. I have no affiliation but recomend him to everyone. He is ""The"" relationship guy. Follow his stuff and both your relatioships with everyone in your lives will get better. 

For reference; I was married to a Psychopathic Narcissistic personality disorder woman for 20 years. She burned off 60% my beard permanently, while I was asleep. Fed me and our kids her cold sores on a spoon with chocolate cake. Tried to talk my son and I into comiring suicide. The usual machiavellian, sadistic kinda stuff.

If he is a true Narc be warned, he will destroy you, if you interfere with something he wants.

 Also, you are way out gunned. They will die, if it means killing you too. They have no limits, physical assaults, set ups, smear campaigns with fake posters in your neighborhood, always playing the victim.

37313,ShredderRedder,t2_450blliv,"You can’t do much. Trying to intervene may result in her distancing herself and if he finds out you’re an ally he will put a stop to it by manipulating her. 

The best thing you can do is compile some resources, telling her to get counselling is a VERY GOOD idea. Get her the number for dv services in your state/region. She can call them whenever she needs, at different times and doesn’t have to run it by her parents - this gives her control. 

The next best thing you can also do is to tell her to keep a diary, any text messages, emails, pm’s etc, screen shot them, print them, put them on USB, send them in an email to herself (better yet another email account created for this purpose).

And, please encourage her to load up on birth control. I don’t know where you are, abortion may be illegal and access to morning after pill may be difficult. This is really important. If her parents are conservative and that, and don’t even encourage her to get help for her mental health, how do you reckon they’ll take her becoming a single teen mum? 

I was in a similar situation with the guy (let’s call him Gold Digger) I was with prior to my kids dad. I did something because I needed to survive. I came clean about it and gave Gold Digger two options ; break up or respect that I had to do something very traumatic (the situation could’ve ended badly for me or been a lot worse, I was extremely lucky). Over the course of the next 2 years he routinely verbally abused me and I think he might have even raped me one time. He used what happened to control, degrade and belittle me, get his own way and used it as an excuse for bad behaviour. I blamed myself, but now, after leaving him in 2015, or him dumping me for a mega rich woman, and then me getting with an even worse guy in 2016 who verbally, socially, financially, physically, sexually and psychologically abused me, who I literally ran away from, pregnant and homeless with less than $20, a suitcase and a backpack in 2018, that I started to realise that I was in a very similar situation with Gold Digger. 

It’s important she contacts dv services especially the telephone counselling service. They will give her encouragement, listen to her and not be biased in anyway other than for her safety. They can also refer to her to services that may be able to help with counselling , self esteem and learning how to identify red flag behaviour in relationships in the future and how to detach and escape safely. 

You are doing the right thing for standing by her, and all the way from Australia, I commend you for your actions. You’re a good guy. When I found out I was pregnant in 2018 and just had my house smashed up by psycho baby daddy he gave me the number for the DV services and I contacted them, it saved mine and my baby’s life. We are in safe stable clean housing and thank fck baby daddy is a lazy stoner drunk (and the whole pandemic thing has actually been helpful to stay broken away) that he hasn’t pursued us in family courts.

First off this is her business, not yours. I understand you, like most guys want to fix things, when frequently women just want to vent, talk their emotions out, without needing to be fixed or have some body mess in their lives.

On the other hand she is allowing the abuse to go on by hanging with this guy. There are other considerations as well. If your g/f won't stand up for herself, she most definitely won't stand up for you or your relationship. 

Obviously your concerned for her, but she is the one that has to live with the consequences. She has to make the decision. 

Her Mom knows and does or says nothing!?

Something doesnt add up. What Mother wouldn't kick him out to protect their daughter, his situation be damned. I might talk openly with the Mother in front of her, just three of you. If Mom acts surprised and doesn't know anything, then you know your g/f is lying. Mom already knows, according to g/f, so there is no breaking her trust there. I can't imagine any parent saying just let him sleep in your bed a while longer, what's a little fingering between cousins!?

Too weird!

If the Mom knows, and this is going to be an ongoing concern, I would end the relationship. Too much toxicity. She can't stand up to men touching her and won't take herself out of the situation. Do nothing and it will happen again.

As to accepting your report, police arent there to ""accept testimony"". Thats done in court. All you are doing is filing reports. If you have texts or emails that show you talking about it to others that can help. But police are the ones that go looking for evidence. Follow the reports.

Even if you are not addicted to drugs and alcohol there are treatment centers for other things. They do have counselors, and women's groups and they deal with everything from child abuse when you were little to domestic abuse all through out your life.  When you are ready I suggest contacting an intake worker at family services. I was in a treatment center and a women's halfway house.  I dealt with the abuse I had endured from males my entire life while I was in rehab. I dealt with inner most emotions I never thought I had. Once I left my halfway house I had a better understanding of who I was. What I wouldnt take any longer and helped me become a stronger independent women.

Because, he would beat me and I would cry. The cops would always be there, called on us by our neighbors. The whole thing was always a mess. Management had enough of it. The last night we spent together at that old place was horrendous. I remember him yelling at me for something I couldn't control and him taking off, in the middle of the night. Claiming he would kill himself. I ran after him, until the sun came out, to make sure he was okay. I couldn't keep up, even though I ran my fucking lungs out. It was actually pouring rain. Eventually, he was so far out of my sight, I couldn't find him. I didn't even have shoes on. I was scared, cold and lost. When I finally had a friend beg me to try to go back the same way I came from and give it a rest, my feet were so blistered and bloody, it wasn't funny. I eventually had to go back to my old roommate's condo (who is toxic and we cut off communication a while back) and he stayed with his parents. During that time, he refused to talk to me. But, what did I do? I paid all of his court bills and paid his parents, who he was in debt to. I gave him a phone. I gave him money. I gave him everything. But, of course it's my fault.

And you have been existing through a vicious campaign of severe physical violence, emotional abuse and trauma. So feeling badly that you protected yourself and seeing yourself as equal to the abuser is not honest nor is it real. 

I would also warn you, dont project your emotions onto this abuser to be the same as when you are abused. I would strongly suggest that what you saw were tears of humiliation. Not pain or hurt like you would feel. And beware. Be very aware. He will come back even move vicious and you are very much in danger. Dont fall into the false sense of security that somehow now he understands choking you and beating you is bad. He doesnt. Hes going to be enraged. 

I know you are living with this person in lock down. That you dont have a job. That you are looking for your exit. However, what really needs to get through to you is that what you are really living through is a fight for your life. One you will not win by physically defending yourself. So when you think about whether to call the police and report all of the abuse, or just taking your things and leaving, what you need to weigh against that is what your life is worth to you. Thats whats really at risk here. You are very close to becoming a number. Finding a spot with a DV Shelter is essential right now. If you can, family or friends, go there. End this relationship. Get free. Choose you. Choose to live. Get out of this. Or next time could very well be your last time. 

Im not sitting in judgement of you hitting him at all. What I am telling you is that choking is the biggest indicator of intimate partner death there is. That its escalating.

A restraining order (aka protection order), won't necessarily protect your mom, it is just a piece of paper, but it does give her the legal right to call the cops and have him arrested if he breaks the order.  An advocate can help get this done. 

The best thing she can do now is document what is happening and find witnesses that will back up her story.  [https://www.domesticshelters.org/articles/legal/why-you-should-document-abuse](https://www.domesticshelters.org/articles/legal/why-you-should-document-abuse)

If you are in the US, file for unemployment. You can back file for several weeks. If you’re in another country I would be happy to see what other options there might be. 

If there is a Facebook page for your community (mine has one) many people are sewing reusable masks. If you asked on there I’m sure one could be delivered. 

The last option is to reach out to a dv shelter. They may be full but may have contacts at a hotel etc. with most hotels being empty right now, it wouldn’t surprise me as shelters are being bogged down with the need for them at this time.

The hard part is you have to go out there and get it.  It won't come to you.  But the more you put yourself out there the more likely you will find your first foothold.  When you find it, seize it and build from there.  You can do it.

Try to not make your own happiness depend on recognition from others.  You may be right that your parents value the cleanliness and tidiness of their home over your wellbeing.  This is something they will come to realise as their wrongdoing but they have to realise this for themselves.  You can't force them to change this or make them realise.  They can only do this from their own discovery.  In the meantime you have a life to get on with.

38332,a5121221a,t2_atd2z,"You might want to call Child Protective Services (CPS) in your area and ask about being a foster before you report.  In many locales, foster parents are given a stipend to support children in their care.  You could call and ask a social worker about it before you report.  You might be surprised to find that you \*could\* support your brothers on your income and the stipend for their care.  If you find that it is an option, I suggest you talk to your grandparents, too, in case they have any evidence or are willing to give a statement.  Be prepared that CPS probably won't remove your brothers right away.  Usually, they give the parents a set period of time to clean up their act or change the adverse circumstances before the children are removed.  There is even the possibility that CPS won't find substantiation of your claims (i.e. your brothers won't give statements to corroborate, your mother won't be honest, etc.) and your brothers will remain in the home.  

Unfortunately, you cannot force anyone else to leave an abusive relationship, even your mom.  It would be best for all of you, but it is out of your hands.  The most you can do is give her resources (like you already have) or report the abuse to the authorities in hopes that your brothers will be protected (but even then, they may be stuck there depending on what the investigation finds).  

You are in a heartbreaking situation.  For what it's worth from an internet stranger, I'm so proud of you for giving your mom resources.  At least she has options in front of her.  If you don't think reporting will help your brothers, perhaps you can encourage them to report what they've seen and experienced.  There should be a guidance counselor at school who they can talk to.

38344,mausratt1982,t2_ymfna,"Five years ago today was the day I left my abusive husband. I just told the story to someone else so. It doesn’t matter; abuse is never okay. 

It sounds like he has you emotionally and mentally tied up as well. I was the same. Even up till the day I left, March 31, 2015, I would have told anyone that he was my whole world, my family. Even though he beat me up regularly and had already tried to kill my a few times— nowhere near as bad as this though. 

You might feel like you deserve this. You might feel like this is as good as it gets. You might feel like you couldn’t do any better than him, and being alone is terrifying. You might feel like you’re the only one who can “handle” him, so you have to stay so he doesn’t hurt anyone else. 

**None of these are correct.** No one deserves what you’re describing, you can certainly do better, and being alone can be amazing. This man deserves to be in a jail cell; iron bars are the only thing that can “handle” him. 

I’ve said this a bunch of times across this post but please— wait until he leaves for the store, have a bag ready, and run like hell either to a trusted friend or to the police station. He is definitely going to kill you, and **soon**. You’ve already noticed things are escalating; they will never deescalate with him. Never.

38346,ImYesILeffHisAss2398,t2_2egrzrvq,"People often have rights to privacy from being recorded so you want to be careful to ensure you arent violating those rights as that itself may be a crime and wouldnt be allowed as evidence. So the best thing you can do is check if your location is a two party consent location (you cant record sound unless its legally allowed and if you live in a place where both parties must consent to be recorded it can be a crime). Then you can use things like baby monitors, old cell phones, etc to document where its appropriate and legally allowed. I would also recommend you call the non emergency police number and speak to them about whats happening and how to address it. 

Its also important to have a reasonable expectation of what the blow back may be to having this person arrested. You are both legal adults and if the parents where you live are enablers (which sounds like they must be) then you may get thrown out. Do you have a plan on where you will live? You do have tenancy rights most places against illegal and unlawful evictions but that wont protect you from being assaulted in the first place or thrown out illegally. Its something dealt with in court. So you need to know how all of this will go down. You are an adult so child protective services and agencies wont help. You are in the legal area of assault, etc. And if your parents are paying for college, and if you are in the US, and you need to further pay any tuition or graduating costs (and know if you will actually graduate this semester with all the craziness going on ) you want to take that into consideration. 

Sometimes its easier to just move out and cut off the enabling parents and block the abusive brother. Remove them from your life permanently. But either way, be sure to reach out for therapy. You are living in an abusive household where that conditions you to be anxious and stressed always fearful of abuse at any minute.

The danger here is next time any physical conflict between you may escalate further.  Today you may have exchanged bruises.  What prevents it from becoming more than that?  How bad are you each prepared to let it go before you stop altogether?  A broken nose, broken wrist, fractured skull?  Pokes to the eyes? Scalding?  Burning?  Cutting?  Stabbing?  Have any threats of this kind ever happened?

These are terrible but all realistically potential next events that you may suffer (or even he might suffer) if this does not stop altogether.

You mention financial obstacles to leaving.  Why should this be important at all?  You are married - so any financial interest he may have in a share family asset could be something you can be compensated for in a divorce.

Messing with your locks was vandalism. If he had moved out it could be break &amp; enter or burglary. 

This guy doesn't respect you or the law, so expect retaliation. But... It will get unbarable if you leave it. He is a typical bully. So call the police everytime he crosses the line. Don't be quiet about it. That's what they want. 

You got better things to do than worry about his issues. Let the cops handle him. If it is a one consent state where you live use a recording app. Casually say this has gone to far, name the specific things he's done, then ask him to move on and leave you alone.

38804,nottryingtobeanitch,t2_4i95fnlh,"Thanks for your honesty. You are correct that I’ve never had formal therapy. I had a teacher with a counseling background that I spoke to for a short time when I was in high school and really struggling. On his advice, I called my entire family into a room and explained that I felt we need family therapy. All of my brothers agreed immediately - even Austin, who it turned out desperately wanted help and was suicidal at the time. My mother even agreed. My father insisted that only weak people needed help with their mental problems, and that I was just being a whiny baby because of what had been done to me. We argued for at least an hour and a half, and my dad ended it by telling me the bad things that happened to me only happened because I asked for it.

We never got to go, and once I was old enough to get out, I just focused on school. I met a great guy, who I’ve been with for almost a decade, and got a good job with a great income. My life is amazing now, and every time I thought of getting counseling, I thought of that conversation with my family, and I’ve just never been able to do it.

But I know your right. Scars don’t go away just because you make a better life for yourself. And you are also not wrong about me feeling the need to fix things. I admit, having no background witty therapy, I’m not sure what you mean by self effacing fixer codependent type or what impact that would have on my decisions.

38814,boopy-cupid,t2_31pgqmst,"I think sibling abuse due to disability or other familial abuse is actually really complex to process. It has been for me and I've been in therapy for over 10 years. And after that time I just want you to know, I agree with you. Rebuilding with my abusive brother was very important for me in dealing with and processing the overall abusive dynamic that I grew up in. That HE also grew up in. 

I don't ""forgive and forget"" and let live. What happened, happened. I can't change it and nor can he. He hurt me. There was no excuses for that. And I'm still struggling with the impacts of that every single day. The consequences of his actions haven't disappeared and they won't. I don't have to forgive or forget, I just accept that what was, was and that it was WRONG and that now we must heal and that he has responsibilities in that also (it is his responsibility, especially now as a functioning adult, to never allow himself to be that person again, for example. Failure to do that would mean an inability for me to interact with him anymore).

I attempted suicide right before I ran away from home due to my brother. It was volatile to say the least and I would have done anything to get away. 

He was doing everything he could to get away also tho. Abuse changes a person. He was 9 when I was born. He'd already endured 9 years on his own with our mother before I came about and then suddenly at 9 he was thrust into the adult caregiver role for the next 15 years. Enduring more1 abuse and neglect every single day of those years. I responded by internalizing and wanting to kill myself... How can I really demonize him for turning out fucked up in a different way too? As I said, I don't forgive him, I don't take the blame away entirely but I can't demonize him fully either.

Yes 35 now and I'm 26. He lives with me and my children. I wouldn't have unsafe people around my own kids, not now. We're thicker then thieves. It was a slow process but the key was honesty and being to slowly see each other's experiences. We are really honest with each other, about what we're feeling and what we need and occasionally about how we grew up. We started doing things we had bonded over as children and then added more ""adult"" experiences on to it and the more I could see how he had grown as an adult the more at ease I felt and the more natural communication became. I also still accept that, that person exists there somewhere and I'm not afraid to call out any bit of it. That was the biggest and most important change in our relationship. Getting used to being vocal and being heard and him getting used to me being ""confrontational"" (and I am a bit with him. But that's the consequence of our relationship and he had to accept that). 

Fetal alcohol syndrome is certainly no joke and unfortunately one of the biggest symptoms is childhood violent outbursts. Abuse is abuse. This is more then true. It's also true that some children are born wired differently then others and until they're given the support and work needed to ""do better"" they don't have the capacity to do that. I have a child on the spectrum who seems to also have a bit of oppositional defiance disorder. Im aware and willing to be here to hold her accountable and guide her, I'm willing to take the hits, kicks, punches and threats until her brain learns to rewire a bit and she can control those aspects. Im willing to take the responsibility for all these things. Every time. Some children don't have that... if your parents weren't willing to admit what the problem even was then I doubt your brother had that. It was their job to protect you and to get him the help he needed. They failed you both immensely and you shouldn't have to lose these bonds because of them. Im sorry they didn't protect you. Im sorry they left you to deal with the consequences of their choices from drinking. Im sorry they let your brother flounder and he didn't get the opportunities he needed in life.

39299,Poisonskittlez,t2_11i93h,"I'm so sorry that you're going through this. What he has done &amp; continues to do to you is *without question* 100% physical, and emotional abuse.

Do not let him gaslight you. [gaslighting is manipulating you into thinking that the behavior is normal and fine, (or trying to convince you that a situation didn't really happen as you remember it, or even at all), and/or that you are over reacting/being dramatic/etc.- this is psychological manipulation that abusers use to make their victims doubt/second guess themselves, (or in extreme cases, even feel as if they are legitimately going crazy) and to normalize their abuse, therefore decreasing the chance of resistance and gaining more control. 

You are not over reacting. Aggressive physical contact should NEVER occur between household members (or anyone really, but this, especially) no matter their relationship. *NO exceptions*. 

I hope that you are able to find a way to leave this situation asap. There are DV shelters that can assist you with all kinds of obstacles you might face, and some can even assist in getting you housing, etc. There are also 24/7 hotlines you can call that can help guide you through the process. It can be much less intimidating to begin the process by calling a hotline, and having someone help you know which steps to take and provide support. 

Wishing you all the best. You can get through this. It doesn't have to be this way.",1585499326,flubk5b,t3_fpy7nh,/r/domesticviolence/comments/fpy7nh/can_this_be_classified_as_domestic_abusephysical/flubk5b/,1,domesticviolence,comment

I am sad to hear about the photos, that must have been absolutely devastating. When you get out, maybe visit the clinic where you got the ultrasound and get the photos back. 

If you can walk, walk it. 

One of the first times I left, I literally put all my stuff in a  shopping trolley and hauled it to the city. If you can, maybe find some dirt cheap accomodation and stay there.

 If it does it again I'll order more cat food from coles. He is alwaya guilting baby mama to let him see his child and she is smart and wont.

He said he tossed them out because they made him feel sad and ""I can't look at a baby that I killed."" his words not mine. He's reffering to causing the miscarriage with stress and violence I assume. Again no reason to toss out the photos. They were already put away in a drawer out of sight. I told him it's very symbolic that he threw the scan photos in trash. And I said if it was a bag of drugs it wouldn't be tossed out. I know he didn't feel sad at all. He would have done in it a big tantrum when I told him to not contact me. No respect for my belongings or baby at all. Absolutely disgusting.

I have dealt with a similar situation with one of my friends when I was in high school. She was being hit by her brother and we kept her at my place for over a month. I cannot give you any legal advice as she did not press charges against her family, but I know my mother felt very worried as in France it is illegal to keep a minor with you if you are not their legal tutor. Hopefully, her parents did not press any charges against us. All I can advise you is to keep your girlfriend safe, keep all the evidence you can and if she's ok with it, maybe go to the authorities together so she can testify and help her siblings too. I know how hard it is to testify against someone you care about, and I am telling you this because I had to do it too, so let her take the time she needs and reassure her that you are here for her.

Because they had no proof of the event i called them about. The first of which was my husband throwing ice water at my face and restraining me when i tried to call 911. For 2 hours. Then this last time he literally attacked me, breaking a window and our pet dishes, he pinned me by my head and legs to the ground so i couldn’t get to my phone to call 911. I pissed my pants, that’s how hard he had me pinned. When i finally got up i ran to my neighbors and beat on their door to no avail. I jumped in my car and drove to police station.

It is hard to see someone you once considered a special person in your life as an abuser. And every time I think I’m over it, a song reminds me of him, my hormones remind me of him or a mutual friend will bring him up. And it all comes back again. This indicates to me that therapy is a path I need to take to work through this. I’ve also been able to have more sympathy for myself if I picture my friend coming to me with this story. That is how I’ve been sort of working through this.  Thank you for bringing up the narcissism and BPD...I’ve looked it up and it resonates with the type of person he was when angered.

39823,katymatey,t2_4s24r907,"I'm sorry you're going through this, you don't deserve this fear. I hope you are able to keep yourself and your siblings safe through this and come out the other end without something like this to worry about. Here is the best advice I can give.

Become familiar with your environment and where you can hide/run. You should have an escape plan in mind, and it may need to account for the ages/size of your siblings. When my life is in danger, I try to hide. Please consider whether hiding or running will be the best course of action based on your and your siblings' ability to outrun your uncle, the tools your uncle may have access to, and his strength. Try not to engage with him at all if possible. If you find yourself in a situation where you have to hide, please be careful about where you hide. Doors that open by swinging inward make it much more difficult to keep yourself safe. If you have the ability to barricade it, do so. I've had to keep myself safe by pulling on the doorknob for hours to keep someone out. Earlier today I used a scarf and tied two tight knots connecting two doorknobs. This was a very temporary solution; it allowed me time to gather my things and shut myself in a different room, but it was easy for the abuser to get through. If your uncle has access to tools, hiding may be a bad idea because it is very easy to dismantle doorknobs and locks. It is also fairly easy to break many doors down. A heavy front door is obviously much more helpful than a wooden internal door.

If he becomes violent, whether hiding or running is the best option, your goal should be to find a safe place to stay for the length of time it would take to call the police and for them to arrive. **Do not let him hear you call the police.** If you have neighbors nearby, please ask them for help if need be. Don't be afraid to call the police because he's family or because you don't think it's bad enough to warrant such a thing. If you think he's going to hurt you, please call the police.

Good luck. Stay safe. You deserve and your siblings deserve peace and safety.",1585450088,flst2fk,t3_fqxqav,/r/domesticviolence/comments/fqxqav/what_to_do_if_an_alcoholic_uncle_turns_aggressive/flst2fk/,1,domesticviolence,comment

40327,Sapphyreopal5,t2_13hoib,"I agree with you 100% here. While in my case I can't say my father was abusive so much, he does have unrealistic expectations and was fairly critical of things like me gaining weight or generally with my appearances. I was never overweight but he would get on me whenever I would eat a lot (because adolescence and puberty you know, growth spurts). He can be a bit of a jerk at times as well making some rude remarks. I suppose that there's a fine line between verbal/emotional/mental abuse and just being a jerk that some people just can't see. 

I think my dad doesn't want to believe that he was ever abusive in any way and even seems to think I ""ruined"" his life by getting a restraining order and such. He thought it wasn't necessary, as if he somehow knows my situation better than I do. This is why I don't like girls turning to some dads for relationship advice or approval, they just don't get things from a woman's point of view or just generally speaking.",1585340664,flollcp,t1_flnr7ed,/r/domesticviolence/comments/fpkc4o/my_dad_the_abuser_sympathizer/flollcp/,2,domesticviolence,comment

My boyfriend/partner started hitting me. For a while I took. Then for a while I would push back. Then he used me pushing back as a manipulative tactic to make me feel like I was aggressing and ruining the relationship. 

Then I stopped pushing back and he escalated into leaving massive bruises on me. Massive bruises turned into broken ribs.

Im sorry you had to deal with that and I hope with time you will come to the full realization that there was nothing you did wrong! He is an emotionally and physically abusive monster who gets off on punishing people. He is a narcissist and may even have Borderline Personality disorder which you may want to read up on both so you can see the signs before you start to hookup with people so you can avoid this situation. It still will be tough and you may find yourself in a similar situation again as narcissists are professional liars and hide their monstrous behavior from people until they want to be evil and do things like he was doing to you. With the gaslighting, putting you down, manipulating and just overall trying to be in control that they feed off of but deep down they know that they arent shit in this world besides toxic children and trying to take someones control away makes their shitty existence a little better in their eyes.

You may want to go to therapy which will help you heal if you find the right Dr! Its very comforting knowing you can tell someone thats unbiased, exactly how you are feeling with no judgement and the experience and knowledge to help in many ways!

If you have a really good friend you trust, I would confide in them and tell them how terrible he is and what he did from a standpoint of warning them. Just know that they are very good liars and he will most likely talk shit and try to get ahead of the story so it does you no good to try and ""fight"" his BS and you should just ignore him as best you can and get ready for the next part of your life.

Have a knife or pepper spray if you go out (unless you have a concealed carry) Protective orders mean nothing right now but have the court papers with you at all times in case the cops catch you with the knife. They will probably let you go if the paperwork is with you. Protect yourself and hide. He will probably get out and proceed to get drunk or high and then get mad..so the next few days are key to being gone. It’ll be ok just be smart. If you have no where to go go to a shelter.

I looked well into the shelter option when I knew things were starting to get more serious and scary at home (before the last incident), and was incredibly disappointed. You basically have to BE homeless with your children and call in to a hotline every second day to keep your name on the waiting list. Should you miss even one day, you’re immediately moved to the bottom of the list.

- providing free therapy
- providing support groups 
- helping you identify other local resources and support

Maybe there’s another shelter near you that has a more robust program in place?

I told him I didn't feel safe and he said this was the reason there was a problem to begin with, because I made him insecure.

At this point I'm just so terribly frightened? As I said previously he's told me he's tried to poison someone before, and I don't see any way for me to feel safe knowing he's done that and been physically violent towards me. My therapist told me this wasn't safe, so I'm staying at my parents for now. I've contacted my landlord and I'm waiting for her to help me figure something out. She seems to be understanding and relatively flexible.

Hopefully things look up after this.",1585160512,flhd9yz,t1_fkr0fbd,/r/domesticviolence/comments/fk6n67/what_now_i_25_f_am_weighing_my_options_to_deal/flhd9yz/,1,domesticviolence,comment

&gt;level 1savybooklover5 points · 8 days agoHey you should read this book! It helped me a lot. It talks about why they do it and myths about why they do it. It was very comforting to have answers and it will help you come to your own decision that is informed!Only you can decide to leave or not but those are pretty big red flags and often it gets harder to leave the longer you stay. For multiple reasons.

41323,ImYesILeffHisAss2398,t2_2egrzrvq,"I know you have hope that this person will somehow change. However, it doesnt sound like its based in anything at all real. This person has taken no steps to actually change, doesnt appear to want to change, and is on his second jail stint for domestic violence. You have to accept people for who they are, not who you want them to be. Its nice to have both parents be there and loving and supportive for a child. Its what is best for kids. However, its traumatic and horrible for a child without their own voice and ability to care or protect themselves from being in an abusive home. Hope doesnt protect children. They deserve at the very minimum a home where they are safe, loved and cared for here. Not a violent home. 

So I would recommend instead of waiting and hoping and trying to go to his family for some idea of this person that doesnt exist to reach out to local abuse agencies. Get some support. Find a good therapist who is qualified in treating victims of abuse.

Right now you are heavily trauma bonded to this person. Abuse is like addiction, the abuser the drug. Its real and its painful and it locks you in chasing the drama and the idea of hope. You would rather see false hope then deal with the reality that this person is abusive and violent and is a real threat to your safety and well being and to your childs life, not to mention he just was violent last weekend while you were pregnant. That is violence against this childs life too. So reach out for real help. Do not contact his family any more. Take action to get free of this abuser and to stop hoping for false change so you can have the drug you are addicted to here at your and your childrens very real expense.",1585187964,flipzaf,t3_fp1sun,/r/domesticviolence/comments/fp1sun/does_anyone_understand/flipzaf/,2,domesticviolence,comment

41818,SulcataGirl,t2_2zfu43cd,"There are specialized therapists for children that use play therapy - imo it is the best approach, especially with young kids.  I would highly, highly recommend it for your children.  Seek therapy yourself  to help yourself process and heal from the abuse and to gain the tools to help your children.  

I was actually unsure of therapy for my son because I wasn't sure what it would entail.  They talk to the kids about feelings, managing them, and expressing themselves.  It's not like therapy for adults - they don't sit in a chair and have the kids talk and ask them questions.  Can you imagine that as a kid?  Neither could I so I was reluctant.  However, my experience with my son's therapy has been *so* incredibly positive.  We've been doing it for 6 months, and I never, never question whether it was a good idea or whether it is helping.  

If you want more info about my situation and why I got my son therapy and how it's progressed and how it's helped him, feel free to PM me.

41823,ELfit4life,t2_hi005v4,"Hair-pulling/dragging (my nex did this frequently) and kneeing you (regardless of your physical state) is *assault*—plain and simple! 

You need to a) **report him *every* time it happens,** for documenting AND legal reasons; b) do NOT marry him; and c) ***LEAVE HIM***! 

What may start as these “small” things can (and will) escalate when your partner is violent, and as someone who’s lived what started (when it got physical) as hair-pulling and slapping, can testify to that being almost always true... (mine escalated to using rape/sexual assault as punishment/“behavior correction”—and I’m thankfully 3-months free now from DV with all forms of abuse.)

While I’ve personally great fear that my case against my ex (as recent evidence has shown by being laughed at/dismissed/questioned as to motive about filing) you should *not*—nor should any victim EVER question their abuse, but we do... *Side note: with my situation, I’m 6’5” but he was “only” 5’7”: however, his psychological power over me (coupled with my severe depression/anxiety/addiction struggles) had me terrified and complacent enough to not fight back... And yes, I was actually laughed at and asked by one judge “how a big gal like [me] could ever let a little man beat/rape me.”*

Anyway, the point is, no, it’s not silly... it’s saddening to hear you say that it’s pointless, not really abusive, or for even a second **think** that you are not deserving of or worth SO much better than you have in a partner. 

Please, listen to us fellow victim/survivor’s advice. Report it (every time), protect yourself, find your support (friends/fam NOT connected to him), make a plan, and leave!! And if anyone asks ‘why,’ never, ever (please please please) lie, make excuses for him, or brush it off—the truth needs to be shared and is where your power lies. You are strong, you are worth LOVE, and you can have a better life than the one you’re living now. Sending love—feel free to reach out, too, any time. 💜

PS: make sure to take pictures of your bruises and video any incidents if you can.

Hes your boyfriend not husband so you arent relying on him for medical insurance. He hasnt contributed to the finances in 3 years so you wouldnt be losing any income to pay bills, you would only be losing dead weight that steals from you. 

So please file the police report. And consider asking for a restraining order due to the violence and theft to remove him from your home. It doesnt matter what his potential could have been or might be if woulda coulda shoulda happens. What matters is what is and he is not someone you want even near you when you are disabled. 

So put a password on your phone that he wouldnt know. Set up two step authentication and change the usernames and passwords on your accounts (including venmo) and create a new email account for this process. Do not reuse information or use words that he would suspect. Change your security questions to non answers. (If Mothers maiden name is the question answer something else like nowayyo or something like that because he may know the security answers). Reach out to your local abuse agency for help with resources and guidance and support through all of this so you dont have to do it all alone. 

And from one disabled person to another, you are already alone. But its worse then that, not only are you alone, but someone is abusing you, stealing from you and threatening you. No matter what the illness or issue, the stress and anxiety from having this person in your living area is very very high and will directly impact any medical condition physically.

This is only the beginning. Hair pulling is definitely violence, as is putting his knee in your back.

Right now he is testing the waters. He knows these seemingly small acts of violence will not be enough to make you leave, he knows you love him and will want to make the relationship work. So now he is testing your limits. 

Right now it’s hair pulling, soon it will be slapping, then punching, a broken nose or a black eye (unless he’s smart enough not to leave visible marks) in that case it will be the rest of your body. 

Eventually it will get to a point where you have become so used to the abuse you barely react any more, and you see nothing wrong with it. At that point he has one.

This is not something that can be discussed or worked on as a part of your relationship, it will not make you stronger as a couple, it is not a normal or healthy part of a relationship let alone marriage. All the marriage counselling and arguing in the world will not fix this.

42815,v0ness,t2_2orvpkti,"You and I have similar circumstances. I will share mine and the outcome. Washington state is wonderful.

I came here from Florida. Washington state took me seriously. First, I notified the police that I was fleeing from domestic violence with my 2 yr old daughter. They had me file a report of the crime for their offices and directed me to a DV center. I told them about my assault. I mentioned that I had been strangled. They offered to do drive bys and assured me that he would be arrested on sight of he were to be seen. They did this for about 6 weeks. The officer was incredibly kind and understanding. I've heard horror stories, like everyone else, and they seem to be the norm. That was not the case for me. I was listened to and believed despite the complications of state lines and jurisdictions.

When I got to the DV center, they did a video conference with a judge who gave me a restraining order for 2 weeks until the court date and had the local police where he lives serve him. The center gave me a safety plan with gas cards and supplies to last for a month or so. Instructions to apply for tanf and food stamps.

The judge was wonderful. Gave me the year restraining order, didn't believe his lies, advised me to make a parenting plan asap. Be very very , even graphically descriptive. That was part of what helped me. I went into the nitty gritty. My ex simply stated no, that didn't happen. Didn't offer further explanation. Just outright denial. 

I applied for foodstamps and tanf and I was approved. I used the tanf to pay rent and tanf pays for daycare. I found a great daycare that I still use and then entered the community jobs program and interned at the recovery center that I work at now. They paid for all of my certifications. I switched from community jobs to career jump and they paid for 10 additional weeks of training. I love my job and I love Washington state. You are at an advantage in this blue state. Please DM if you need help. I am centered in Tacoma but travel to Puyallup and Federal Way for group therapy. I go to Seattle sometimes too.

Here in Minnesota, many officers are trained in crisis intervention, which means you definitely can call the police when someone does something like overdose and you are worried about how it will affect them, and you.  But usually it's reserved for the point they actually present danger to themselves or someone else.  I don't imagine abusing medication and drinking at the same time is going to keep him at any even pattern, so be ready to call someone.

If you have NAMI around, call them and talk to someone as they may have some good suggestions on what you legally can do.

You say that the mother is the only one doing the abuse, but you also say the mother removes money from the fathers account which makes me think that they are together. Clearly the Father, if hes still there, hes living in that hoarding situation and enabling the abuse, which is enabling the abuser at the expense of the child. 

Sometimes a family member will take in a child rather then them going to a stranger. But there is no system in place to do any of this by force outside of police and child services. It doesnt sound like your GF is in a financially stable situation to be able to care for the child if child services were to remove her. Is there older siblings or other extended family that can get involved in terms of fostering the child? But there is nothing to be done on your end or really your GFs end that would not involve the police and child services. They are the ones that can force the case and step in. You cant. There isnt any way to take a child away from a parent that is unwilling and abusers arent likely to give the child up if they are a preferred outlet.

Remember that your father will not have the authority that comes with his job in your community. Presumably you will be in student housing of some kind there. If you manage to get there before them, it will be YOUR housing, not theirs. 

If you begin researching step by step what life looks like there and what resources exist for victims, I suspect that you will begin to develop a better understanding of what you can expect. I would also suggest IF YOU CAN DO SO SAFELY that you start taking pictures of any injuries you get while still in the current situation. Those will help you support your claims once you are in a safer community. This looks like a good place to start researching (in English, I don’t speak Dutch and don’t know if you do).

Mine didn’t hit me for the first two years we were together. After he started though, he didn’t stop.

1. I wonder if your friend used you as a living diary. She gave you evidence of the abuse. Why? Maybe she thinks her spouse is capable of killing her and trying to hide it. 

2. That was incredibly rude of her to speak to toy in that way. I personally would break off communication unless/ until she apologizes and knows that you're role is a friend, not source of evidence only.

Call the cops, take screen shots of EVERYTHING. It counts in court as evidence. Post on social media, and call the MP's. You will probably get further with the MP's. They take DV very seriously. Keep a log of all contact and threats. Get a restraining order ASAP, and press charges. You can do that from a different state. I did. 

Idk what state you are in, but if you are in Washington, I can help you get into an underground DV shelter. You have to be prepared to go with your daughter at a moment's notice and be willing to have no contact with ANYONE for at least 90 days. They can help you with court proceedings from where you are, and you won't have to appear in person as there is a credible threat to your life.

Alert your friends and family immediately. And maybe your neighbors. Everyone needs to be on high alert. Go to/call your local DV shelter asap for further resources in the mean time.

43801,rl_cookie,t2_5pzuuny8,"Came here after reading the post you’re referring to. Here’s my two cents; I’ve had many relationships both romantic, or just friends with addicts and alcoholics for many yrs of my life, and there was never a case, no matter how fucked up one of those ppl got, where they put their hands on someone. The people who had done that while under the influence were also the people who ended up doing that when clean whether long-term or not. 

My ex who I broke up with bc he’s a alcoholic and now we are best friends, he’s the nicest hardest working biggest heart having dude. For whatever reason when we were dating and he’d be wasted or blackout this nasty side would come out- not af the bar or around friends, but once we got home. But never, ever, did he threaten to or actually put his hands on me.

So while I’m not saying it doesn’t happen, in my personal experience with quite a few addicts, if you’re a physical abuser, you’re like that whether your drunk or high on heroin or completely sober. Psychological abuse is different, as addicts are very well known to be manipulative and to gaslight.",1584718826,fl0z6k7,t3_flvt93,/r/domesticviolence/comments/flvt93/question_does_anyone_know_how_often_just_once_is/fl0z6k7/,1,domesticviolence,comment

For some people, violence and other abuse as a means of control has been something learned as a coping behavior. These people have learned that to denigrate, threaten or hurt others makes them feel more powerful and in control, especially if their victim backs down or becomes compliant after. 

For more well adjusted people, they have learned other coping mechanisms or have better self-esteem and comfort with their position in life. The idea of using abuse or violence to cope with these stresses just doesn't even factor in.

For the group who have learned to be abusive to cope, they also have generally learned that it's wrong. They sort of build a barrier and use self control to keep themselves from relying on that means of coping, to inhibit that behavior.

When you are drinking, those inhibitions lower. If he was drinking with someone who makes him feel small, and maybe is abusive to him, it can remind him of those old habits he had learned.  When he comes back, he's feeling vulnerable and weak, he's been recently reminded of those old habits, and he's drunk so the inhibitions that would normally stop him from doing that aren't enough.  He hits his wife, and she backs off, leaves him alone, gets scared.  He feels in control again. He can change her behavior.  If she's happy he can make her sad, if she's confident he can make her scared. If he felt powerless before, he feels like he's reclaimed some power now. 

One of the things that inhibited him before might have been identity, he might think that he's not the kind of person to hit his wife, but now there's cognitive dissonance.  He just hit his wife, so either he will stop thinking of himself of being not that kind of person and instead think that people who are upset about spousal abuse are overreacting, or he will kind of shift the goalposts and consider that what he did wasn't actual REAL abuse because he's gone and redefined what real abuse actually is. 

But the other big thing is he's just felt the satisfaction that he got from doing the act. This is now fresh in his memory.  The next time he starts to feel that pain of feeling powerless, his limbic system is going to remind him of that very effective way to stop feeling powerless, and that urge will be stronger. 

The walls that keep him from using those tools to avoid that pain just eroded. Now a person CAN recognize this and stop it, but even if he did, he's going to have to do more mental work NOW to avoid resorting to abuse than he did before he reinforced it by carrying out the abuse. And if he wasn't willing or able to do that work to stop carrying out the abuse in the first place, he will very likely find himself in a position where he's not willing or able to do the work to stop carrying out the abuse next time.  

If his response were to immediately stop drinking, check himself into counseling, ensure that his partner was safe, admit the fault, ensure his partner had a means of keeping herself safe in case he were to fail to control this behavior in the future, then yeah, it might be a one-time thing if he successfully did these things.  But the fact is that taking those steps is extremely unlikely,  following through with those things is also extremely unlikely, and if he truly WAS concerned about her well being while he ""got better"", he would want her to leave to keep herself safe.

This kind of behavior is basically an addiction, a habit.  It's a way of reacting to stress, pain, fear to remove those feelings. 

Learning this way of coping often happens early, often at the hands of someone else who uses it against you.  

It's not the alcohol that makes them violent, the alcohol only tears down the protections that kept them from using violence in the first place. 

The urge to use abuse or violence as a coping mechanism doesn't mean someone is ""evil"".  It's a normal part of our behavior and the way our limbic system works, and how much you want to do it is a function partly of your biology and of your experience.  A person might have learned these things from someone who harmed them.  In the same way that a craving for heroin doesn't make someone an evil person, and there have been kids abused by their parents that make them take drugs.  

It's not the kid's fault, even when they're an adult, but the urge and the craving is still there.  But then it's their responsibility to do everything they can to avoid putting themselves in that position.  In the same way that a kid who was made a heroin addict by their abusive junkie parents might become clean, a kid who was abused and learned that hurting other kids made them feel better can realize it's bad and avoid it.  But also, if that person who was previously a heroin addict finds themselves under a lot of pain and stress and finds some opiates, it's very unlikely that they'll just stop after doing that once.  It's the same way when that person who copes through abuse lets themselves feel that power and control from the abuse, they will do it again because it works for them in the moment even if they hate it rationally. 

If you're an abuser, you need to treat yourself like an addict.  You need to find other means of coping with the sort of feeling that you think will feel better after you denigrate or hurt someone.  You need to keep yourself away from situations where doing these things are easy, you need to resist even the smallest urge to satisfy your cravings in that way, and you need to forgive yourself for errors.

But it's worse than some other addictions because it relies on hurting others, it makes it hard to truly forgive yourself, and that makes it harder to stop. You're also constantly in situations where you can be abusive, it's nearly every time you're in a social scenario. But it's also very rewarding to find other means of coping because it will improve your social interactions as people will stop wanting to avoid you, and your overall self-image will start to improve. 

Abusers don't generally start with a punch to the face, it's normally going to be other humiliating behavior, things designed to shut you down, change your mood, manipulate you.  It can also be in ""good"" ways as well as bad, doing things to try to make you happy can also fill that need for control.  But if you don't respond happily enough to satisfy them, to make them feel like they're impactful enough to effect a real change, then they might resort to abuse to try and effect a change that way. The satisfaction they get is by making you do the thing they expect you to do when you otherwise wouldn't yourself. It can be as satisfying to make someone happy who is sad, as it is to make someone sad who is happy if that control is what is being craved. 

But if someone is in a relationship and trying to constantly affect your feelings, you'll eventually become resilient to it.  Being called names might hurt a lot the first time, but after having it happen constantly it just becomes a thing that happens and you stop being so upset by it.  If the abuser's goal is to upset you and namecalling stops working, then the abuser will move up to something that's more effective at changing your mood, and they just learned that a punch to the face was very effective. 

There's no situation where someone should stay with a partner who has just punched them. The possibility that it gets better is incredibly low.  It is possible, but even for the purpose of the abuser avoiding a relapse, it's going to be necessary to separate, and possibly stay separated forever.  It's the same question of whether or not it's a good idea to keep a bottle of vodka next to an alcoholic.  If you want them to get better, that bottle needs to be gone, and while it might be possible later for that recovered alcoholic to deal with the presence of alcohol, it's probably safer for him if it's just not in the house any more. Because maybe one time after he's had a particularly rough day, and he feels that he maybe deserves just a little something, and that he can control himself now, he might decide he can have a little sip, and then remember just how potent it was at handling those little immediate stresses, and how comfortable it made him feel. How he can wash away that discomfort with that small action. But even more potently if he tried a little more.",1584728779,fl1gxr7,t3_flvt93,/r/domesticviolence/comments/flvt93/question_does_anyone_know_how_often_just_once_is/fl1gxr7/,1,domesticviolence,comment

I understand that making the decision to leave isn’t always easy. I stayed for 23 years until I finally left for good. After healing, I volunteered at a DV shelter. It really opened my eyes on why I stayed, and why I thought the just pushing and slapping that the DV started with would stop or wasn’t so bad. Sometimes we can’t leave because we feel like we can’t make it financially, or it is a pride thing, or we think they’ll change. They don’t.

43826,SulcataGirl,t2_2zfu43cd,"Download a voice recorder app.  Just start it discretely - one button - and put your phone down.  It is essentially ""off"" with the lock screen and everything.  I wish I'd done that.  Not even for court (I'm not sure it would even be admissible) but for me to remember, anytime he tried to get me to come back, forgive him, etc.  You know what's coming.  I've been there, and near the end, all I felt was anger, too.  I wanted to fight back.  I *did* fight back.  I broke his nose and cracked his 3 front teeth.  This was after he broke down a door to get to me, broke a lamp over my head, and had me pinned to the ground, choking me for who knows how many minutes.  I was literally fighting for my life.  I kept going black, then he'd let off a bit so I could breath, then do it again.  I fought like my life depended on it, because it did.  And God did it feel good to fight back.

I could've been arrested and charged with dv based on his injuries.  He was too embarrassed to admit I'd caused them, so I was okay in that regard.  But *if* he'd chosen to go after me by calling the cops, my life would've been over.  I wish I'd had a recorder back then.  It would've saved me if he'd tried to accuse me of DV.  Even if you don't plan on fighting back, a recording will tie everything up in a neat bow for you going forwards.  Want an RO?  You've got evidence.  (Also take pics of all injuries and material damages he causes).  The more evidence you have, the less leverage he has over you.  

Also, it would've felt so fucking good to play a recording of one of the incidents to ""friends"" and ""family"" who said these ""fights"" must've been mutual, and we were both at fault.  Or those who couldn't imagine he was like that because we seemed like such a perfect, happy couple.  Most of those people said if the abuse had actually happened, I must be a really good actress.  No, assholes - he's a fucking mosnter when he drinks and I did *nothing* but try to calm him and diffuse the situation that I knew was building and would lead to an assault.

Sorry, I don't know if any of that is even helpful.  Your post just reminded me so much of where I was at near the end.  I guess I just vented.  Fuck anyone who's telling you what you *should* be doing.  You've decided to leave this relationship, and you are doing what you need to in your particular situation.  FYI, if you call the cops and have injuries and that recording, they will take him, you could get an RO pretty easily, and you can ensure the only way he comes back to get his things is with a police escort - for your protection.  

Of course, also call a DV organization for advice and resources.  I got free therapy for a couple of months, and they hooked me up with a private DV support group.  You're doing the right thing.  Also, it's okay to be *pissed.*",1584745390,fl28msp,t1_fl24nv2,/r/domesticviolence/comments/fm2ovg/just_want_him_to_come_home_and_get_it_over_and/fl28msp/,3,domesticviolence,comment

While you may not feel like leaving him, do consider this, while it's only pushing and shoving, what will happen if it escalates to strangulation or assaulting you with a weapon? What about your daughter growing up being exposed to domestic violence? Kids pick up on a lot of things and this is the type of behaviour they'll come to normalise. She may one day get into a relationship where the guy does the same thing to her, and because seeing you being verbally abused and pushed is normal to her, she will just accept that as norm and allow her partner to treat her that way. How does that make you feel?

You are in the best position right now to show her what is and isn't acceptable behaviour. You can show her how resilient and courageous her mum is for being able to stand her ground and set boundaries with your boyfriend.

If you don’t have money, you might have to get your hands a little dirty. Figuratively, I mean - please wear rubber gloves when messing around under the hood of a car. If it’s just something disconnected, you can fix it yourself with a little elbow grease. Here’s what you do:

1) look up a schematic online of what your engine area should look like on your car. If you still have the car’s manual, that will be a useful tool. 

2) look for any differences between the picture online and the layout in front of you. Pay attention to hoses and plugs - these are the easy things to disconnect. 

3) look underneath your car for puddles. He may have knocked something loose and caused a leak. 

4) check your fluids. This includes oil, transmission fluid, and radiator coolant, and power steering fluid. There should be 3-4 reservoirs under the hood, but one may be for the windshield cleaner. Make sure you know which is which - you don’t want to get these fluids mixed up. If you are unsure which reservoir is for which fluid, consult a guide online - each reservoir has a symbol that denotes what it is for. If any of them is low, you’ll need to refill it. Use the internet to figure out which type is suitable for your car - yes, it does matter; you have to base it on your make and model, and sometimes also the year. 

4a) if you need fluid but you don’t have it and you can’t get anybody to take your to the store, buy it online from a store that makes home deliveries. You may have to buy from a grocery store to get that service, but it doesn’t hurt to call and ask an auto care store if they can make deliveries to your house because your car is messed up. 

5) if you have done all of the above steps and your car still won’t run, call a mechanic. It might be the more expensive option, but it gets the job done.",1584769881,fl35v49,t1_fl24pq3,/r/domesticviolence/comments/fm2ovg/just_want_him_to_come_home_and_get_it_over_and/fl35v49/,1,domesticviolence,comment
43854,CelesteIsTaken,t2_56efccfy,"Let's start with the basics. When a person is abusive and aggressive by nature, he will sooner or later reveal it, whether you do something that angers him or not. Sometimes people haven't been violent for the first year or so, not because they were better people, but because they didn't know what the consequences would be, yet. Usually, when a person hits one time, he/she will hit again, you already know the danger that's up to come. You already know you HAVE to leave, but you're stuck in the idea of how it is when you're both happy. First thing you should realize is that you are NOT happy.  Think about how it is, to be with a person you trust, to know he won't hurt you, even if he is completely over the line angry. This is the happy you deserve. Also, you shouldn't blame yourself for discovering the truth, in fact, truth is all you should seek, in my opinion. The only thing that you should be careful is not to hit someone because he asked you to. It's not your responsibility to ease their self-destructive pain. When someone asks you to be abusive, you step away, cause he wishes to define who you are, and he wants to watch you becoming violent just like him, so he can feel better with himself, or justified to keep being aggressive. There are plenty of people who are mature enough to not have anger issues, violent desires etc. And they are hella more interesting. You think you can't find better? I stayed in an abusive relationship for almost 2 years, because I thought I couldn't find better, I felt lost, like I would be alone missing him forever.. My opinion today? I think you have found one of the worst, and it's time to actually seek for secure with themselves people. You have no idea how good the good times are with a person who doesn't destroy everything the next minute. It's what I'm living right now, with a new intelligent and mature person. There are people you have no idea how better they are than your abusive childish bf, and you also have no idea how better you can become, by giving yourself what she finally fucking deserves.",1584780595,fl3etl0,t3_fmbg0h,/r/domesticviolence/comments/fmbg0h/bf_of_almost_2_years_chokedhit_me_for_the_first/fl3etl0/,1,domesticviolence,comment

You probably haven't had the opportunity to openly speak of the abuse and that can do wonders for your psyche. You'll start healing, you can reconnect with the people you love and hopefully their support will remind you that you deserve love without fear for your well-being. 

This should also help when you inevitably start thinking you miss him. You need people that know you to remind you why you left. The psychological impacts of abuse can make your brain do crazy shit. You need trusted people to tell you when your brain is fucking with you.

44345,FifiLeBean,t2_u9fjt,"Ok, I called the help hotline. The woman was great. I asked her about what I needed to do for a safety plan, since I was living with him at the time. 

She helped me with some practical answers, and also helped set an appointment with a woman to meet with me. I am still getting help, meeting weekly (well until COVID-19) with a support group. 

I highly recommend the help hotline. 

As for friends, I have had just one or two who understood, the others were awful. They were judgemental, incredulous, fell for his lies, etcetera. Still do. Most people are just not educated enough to understand the complexity of this situation. (The irony is that they generally think that we are stupid and blame us). 

The one really good friend who stood by me, figured out he was gaslighting and abusing me verbally: she said she's on reddit and I think she got educated here somehow. She was and remains brilliant and a light in the darkness for me. 

**The domestic violence people: they GET IT. They know exactly why you went back, they understood why I was confused for so long and hoping he would really change. I don't have to waste my time and energy explaining and defending myself.** 

I highly recommend Lundy Bancroft books (a ton on here, I see other people really love them, too). He gave me a way to explain things and figure out what my husband was doing. It was a huge help. I started with Why Does He Do That, then Should I Stay or Should I Go.

44360,ItNeverRainEveryDay,t2_5u00666o,"Absolutely. And, in my case, the selfless giving taught at my church has really enabled my own problem of codependency. Whenever I felt used or not taken care of, I mentally smacked myself and told myself to stop being so selfish. And when I noticed red flags about my husband, I mentally smacked myself again and told myself to stop being so judgmental. I recognize all that now, and I'm working on it. I will absolutely take NO MORE CRAP from anyone. No one can convince me to stay with this man. He is my enemy, and that is how I will continue to see him.

I never really considered myself a feminist before, but I'm all the way on that side now. After my own bishop let me down, I've realized that my patriarchal church has some severe problems. My husband should have gotten his priesthood taken away immediately for any type of abuse he's caused. My church leaders have said so. But my bishop is doing whatever the hell he wants, and he wants to ""help"" my husband by letting him keep his responsibilities in the church and letting him ""serve."" He absolutely believes all the lies my husband tells him. My husband says he's sorry for everything, and the bishop believes him. My husband says he never actually had sexual feelings for our children--he was just uncomfortable with their clothing choices. My bishop believes him.

You need people who are on your team right now. And there is no shame in it. 
And call that hotline. I know you feel like you don't need to do it, but that's the abuser talking. Call that hotline. Tell them what's happened. Only if you talk about it can you accept what's happened to you. And only if you talk about it will you know what injustices you've gone through.
Also? You aren't someone who went back to abuse. You are someone who fell victim to it. You NEED to understand this. Abuse is complex and leaves emotional scars. You don't need to feel ashamed.

If your biggest concern is about custody, I don’t think you should worry about it too much. Threatening murder-suicide multiple times, and being directly neglectful, should be good reason for him to only be allowed supervised visits. Your lawyer will fight for custody with him, not you.

Murder suicide is super serious and happens in many cities every year. I’m sure it is surreal to live with that threat.

I’ll have to ask my lawyer what would happen if I denied him the visits. I feel as though there would be significant legal repercussions. My guess is that the court would sympathize with my husband (as most people seem to do) and see me as a terrible wife who’s denying him his “right” to see his kids.

A mobile phone may accomplish the same goal with an app of some sort. This would allow your kids to call you whenever they like , at the very least.

Obviously, when it was discovered, they stuck it in a Faraday cage and went to court over it. In my sil's defense, she was dealing with a Munchausen by proxy type of situation along with a Narcissistic control freak of a mom and ex wife (of my sil's new husband). Unfortunately, some exes can't let go and will resort to making everyone's life miserable.

Otoh, when a child's safety is at stake that's a different story altogether.",1584608547,fkww6xp,t1_fkwrrfy,/r/domesticviolence/comments/fl5v66/they_think_im_overreacting/fkww6xp/,1,domesticviolence,comment

My abuser was extremely self aware, gave the best apologies and knew exactly why he did it and why he wouldnt do it again. Abusers arent some big mean monster that runs around attacking people constantly. There is a lot of underlying issues that makes these people unpredictable and unstable and it won't be obvious. That is why we need to take responsibilities for ourselves and know the red flags. What happened to you wasn't normal, I know people who have been together for over 40 years, had many difficult moments and justified reasons to be angry at their partner and never had stories about having a random mental break down and shoving their partner in to a corner and ""kind of"" punching them over nothing. It's easy to give excuses to our abusers but it's not easy to reverse damage. Please seek out professional help about this situation. When someone shows you they're violent, even if its once, especially when you did absolutely nothing, then you should take it seriously. The more excuses you make the more you are playing yourself.

For an abuser to change they have to accept FULL responsibility for their actions. They need to make a long term commitment to anger management and therapy. And they have to have a deep down, heartfelt commitment to change. The statistics I’ve seen are that less than 10% change and that the number may actually be as low as 5%.

So now when someone does something shitty to me I completely want to snap. But what I’ve also been coming to realize lately is, I can scream until my face is blue, I can get as angry as I want, but it’s literally IMPOSSIBLE to change someone’s way of thinking. So me getting so worked up is extremely mentally exhausting, so there’s literally no point in arguing. Especially if they just gaslight the shit out of you anyways and no matter what is said it’ll be twisted up in some way. There’s no winning ha. 

I also literally only have my fiancé and my son pretty much. I’m not close with my parents, or relatives (because of my lovely mother) or any friends really since I had my son. So there’s almost no one I could just call up and vent to for support. That’s why I’m posting on reddit and I feel so fucking pathetic. Also, unbiased opinions are nice too. But I don’t have a license yet, so it’s difficult to go anywhere or meet anyone. It’s been lonely. There are some things I’m going to do ASAP, like getting my license, and a GED and try to get my shit together as quickly as possible. But for right now, realistically, I feel there’s not much I can do besides ride it out because I don’t have shit right now.

You know your situation and options better than any internet stranger. So take what I say as simply a point of view, which may or may not help. 

I stayed years in a relationship that was a lot like yours sounds. I stayed because I didn't have money or a job and felt like I had no external support. The longer I stayed, the harder it was to see a way out. 

I was finally so beaten down I got a secret therapist over the phone. Having that outside perspective helped me see that even if he wasn't hitting my kids, he was abusing them by creating such an angry, tense atmosphere in our house. I thought I was protecting them by staying so I could redirect his anger towards me instead of them, but I was really teaching them that abuse is normal. 

I finally left when he laid into my daughter verbally in public so badly she ran from his car and refused to ride with him. I feel terrible to this day that I didn't leave earlier and spare her this experience. I've since learned that there was a lot of emotional and even physical abuse going on behind my back. My children were too scared to tell me. All my attempted protection was useless. 

I lost almost everything when I ended it. But I also found I had support from unexpected places. I still have to deal with him because of our children and he's still horrible, but my children are happier and they know it's not ok to treat people badly. 

If you decide to stay, please do not marry this man. It will make things much harder if you decide to leave someday.

In all likelihood they will just take the report and file it away. While this is upsetting, file anyway. And keep filing every time he says or does anything that makes you question your safety or the safety of your children. Find a DV counseling center and call them. Reach out to professionals in your area. Most DV centers offer counseling for free or at a nominal fee. Make a flee bag containing all of your important papers, money and documents.

45322,SulcataGirl,t2_2zfu43cd,"I don't know what kind of report you should/could file, *but* I believe your husband is *EXTREMELY* dangerous.  These behaviours and comments are very disturbing and I think you and your family may be real danger of family homicide.  This is highly concerning - like on an off-the-charts level.  Can you take the kids and move in with your family?  Please contact a DV organization immediately and tell them ALL of this.  They will take this seriously and will be able to find you safe, secure housing with a secret location that won't be disclosed to him.  That is probably a better option than your family, to be honest.  If you go to your family's he may follow you there and kill or attack all of you.

I'm very, very disturbed by this.  Your husband is unhinged and needs immediate psychiatric intervention, if not actually admitted or locked up for some time.  Please call your local DV organization.  They can help advise you what the best course of action is in this situation and provide you with information regarding what should be reported to the police, doctors, or adult protective services.  They also generally have legal advice and guidance for getting a restraining order, which you ABSOLUTELY need.  This terrifies me because people contemplating/planning familicide do not care about restraining orders.  

You need to remove yourself and your children *as soon as physically possible.*. I am so, so, scared for you.  This is NOT normal and must be addressed.  You may say to yourself ""he would never *really* do that"" but anyone saying/doing these things is *exactly* the type of person who *will* do it.  Please PM me if you need to talk.  I don't think I've ever been so scared for anyone who's posted here before... and I've been very scared for *many* posters.

45350,floofypajamas,t2_4io7vxtu,"Oh, my dear, please make a plan to leave him. It will not get better. He says therapy doesn't work for him but I'll guarantee that he's never actually gone to therapy and he doed *not* think he needs it. He is not taking any responsibility for his actions, these are the hallmarks if a narcissistic personality.

You are living in a cycle of violence. That's how it works. Please look it up. You are justifying the violence by saying it isn't as bad as other women have it, it could be worse... And you're correct, it *could be* worse... And I'll just bet that if you stay it *will* get worse. Every abused woman I know always says they'd never stay with someone who abuses them (whether it's physical or emotional) until the day they lie to themselves and allow their partner to gaslight them. It's insidious and it will stay with you for the rest of your life and it's extremely difficult to change your mindset the longer you stay, even with therapy once you leave.

I know all of this because I spent 15 years with my abuser. It took me 10 years to finally figure out I *had to* leave... But took another 5 to finally get away. I won't lie and say it's easy. I had it much easier than many women because I didn't have kids. I'll never forget the morning that my ex went apeshit because he couldn't find his pants that were hanging in the closet, right in front of him. My dog crawled into the bed and laid right on top of me. My ex thought it was funny and started laughing - it wasn't funny and I wasn't laughing. Another time he lost it while u was in the shower... And my dog crawled into the tub and sat in the shower at my feet. All because my ex was screaming and throwing things at the walls.

As of today, it has been exactly 17 years since I told him to get out, and almost 16 years since the divorce was final. I got out and never looked back. I was extremely fortunate to meet someone else and I got married again.... But, I still have violent nightmares. I don't sleep well from the PTS. I have a lot of issues with PTS and even with years of therapy some things just never go away. Thankfully as time goes by I think about him less and less and rarely think about my time with him on purpose but remembering so that I could write this is alright. I would do it more often if it can help others.

I hope you will seek help to get away from him. There are many resources available to you - I'm guessing you're in the USA - if not, most countries have resources for battered women.

45810,ImYesILeffHisAss2398,t2_2egrzrvq,"There are a number of issues here. First, why do you think he will just move out if you ask? Often an eviction has to take place, or a lease expire to remove them from living with you. That takes action legally speaking and time. I would recommend a lawyer help you with that to ensure you do it legally because abusers will continue to try to abuse you legally and financially. 

As to taking the kids, its not illegal for you to take the kids with you if there is no custody orders in place. However, if you expect to deny him the right to be with his kids, you really need to have a legal order backing that up. You would need things like a temporary custody order. I recommend a lawyer for that. 

Then you have to deal with custody and divorce proceedings. I recommend a lawyer for those things too. One experienced in high conflict divorce. If you want to be sure that you are positioning yourself legally in the best possible way you need to speak to a lawyer. 

Proving abuse in court is very difficult. Having even proven abuse in court is difficult to change custody from say 50/50 and that doesnt include things like medical, educational, legal, religious rights. And even if they have had no interest in the kids or actually being a parent, dont assume they wont try for full custody just to deny you what you want. They will do everything they can often to legally and financially abuse you. 

So before you take any action that may affect you for a very long time, please seek out an actual attorney. They are the ones that are familiar with the laws in your area, the courts, and what the courts do in abuse situations. Do not make rash decisions if you can help it. Also, please reach out to your local abuse agency for support. They can also help with exit planning and getting you a referral to a qualified therapist experienced in treating victims of abuse. It will be very bumpy in all likelihood. Having that support already in place can help a great deal while you go through this legal process that can take a good amount of time.",1584390401,fkomvjz,t3_fjrcig,/r/domesticviolence/comments/fjrcig/leaving_with_kids/fkomvjz/,2,domesticviolence,comment

If he does leave, he might not have anyone around here to stay with since he's not from here. He would have to move back to his home town. Sharing custody would be more difficult at that point because of the distance. Doing Skype would let him have access to the kids as much as he could from that far away. 

His type of abuse would be more difficult to prove because it doesn't inherently leave evidence. I've been trying to video/audio record things but it might take a while to really gather enough stuff.

If he doesnt leave they would then need to proceed on eviction process. This process can take a very long time, many months. So hopefully he doesnt stay. Once hes gone, locks need to be changed. 

As to where he goes, thats on him. If he goes back to his home town, thats on him. The courts will provide the process of how many visits. Just be sure that they are not allowed in your home at any time no matter what. He may need to travel to pick them up, take them back to his home town, and bring them back to you. Just dont let him in your home at any time. 

As to recording, please know that doing that can be illegal in many places. So first, consult with an attorney, even if you are in a one party consent location. It may never see a court room.

45822,jewels275,t2_1eicrb1b,I left my husband with a restraining order. I took my daughters. They were 4 and 6.  If he is verbally and emotionally abusive towards you causes you to be fearful of him. You can still get a restraining order. My husband was very controlling verbal and emotionally abusive. He was also physical at times sexually assaulted almost daily. I was with him for 7 years before I finally left.   You can go to domestic abuse shelter and file for order of protection.  They will guide you through the process and hook you up to resources.  Legal aide etc. Most lawyers give 30 minute free consultation in person or on phone.  You can have him removed by telling him he needs to leave. Or your family member needs to evict him. Most states you need to give 30 day notice depending on your lease or your situation.   If your really not sure about any of the suggestions made by others I would contact a divorce lawyer and maybe write down some questions you have for them so you dont forget what you are really trying to ask. Then they will inform you what your best legal option is.  I would also contact Legal Aide in your county.

45829,ImYesILeffHisAss2398,t2_2egrzrvq,"&gt; I don’t know how to be okay without them but this is destroying me. I don’t feel like myself, everything feels so wrong. I just want them to love me again without hurting me. I want it all to stop. How do I move on and build a life without them in it without feeling lost, isolated, and hopeless?

Abuse is like drug addiction, the abuser the drug, with brainwashing and conditioning tactics. None of this is about love. Its the addiction in your brain being translated into ""love"" because its not normal to think of this stuff in terms of abuse which is usually to substances or behaviors. It is. And that deep desire to win their love, to seek their approval and validation and acceptance, its all part of the abuse. And its not going to lessen while you are with them. At the same time the actual violence and abuse will escalate, not get better. 

So when you talk about feeling lost, isolated and hopeless, thats an effect of abuse itself. So reaching out and getting help with a therapist experienced specifically in treating victims of abuse is a good start. If you do separate, go No Contact, block this person on all fronts. It will kick you into withdrawal (just like with drugs) and it can very much be physical. Do not look at pictures, seek out their social media PR campaigns, seek out information on them, etc. You cannot make someone that abuses you love you, they have no love to give anyone. However, a significant portion at the beginning of the relationship is used to convince you that not only are they ""perfect"" for you (by mirroring you and pretending to be someone they arent) its also about creating a fake version of the future with you. None of this ever existed. Its like a character from a book. They have no love for you. None. No decency. And abuse isnt accidental, its a continued pattern over and over again. You can see that in your post. Nothing stops the abuse if they can get to you and abuse you. Thats your job for them. So reach out for help. Take steps to help yourself. Thats the only way this works.",1584414903,fkpo7hz,t3_fjx4pz,/r/domesticviolence/comments/fjx4pz/how_to_be_okay_with_leaving/fkpo7hz/,1,domesticviolence,comment

46307,Up-Town,t2_oi79uhv,"23F, your BF's abusive behaviors and anger  issues cannot be excused but perhaps can be explained. They may be due  to his having very weak control over his own emotions (i.e., a lack of  coping skills that most people acquire in childhood). If that is an  issue, however, you likely should be seeing 4 other warning signs you  have not yet mentioned.

The first  is a strong abandonment fear. I therefore ask whether, a few months into  your relationship, he started showing strong jealousy over harmless  events -- or started attempting to isolate you away from close friends  and family? He would view your spending time with friends/family as your  choosing THEM over HIM. Moreover, he would HATE to be alone by himself.

Second,  you would be seeing him rely heavily on black-white thinking, wherein  he categorizes everyone as ""all good"" or ""all bad"" and will recategorize  someone -- in just a few seconds -- from one polar extreme to the other  based on a minor infraction. Because he also uses B-W thinking when  judging HIMSELF, he hates to acknowledge making a mistake.

To  him, it would mean he is ""all bad."" He thus would blame nearly all  mistakes on you and view himself as ""The Victim."" Moreover, this B-W  thinking also would be evident in his frequent use of all-or-nothing  expressions like ""you ALWAYS..."" and ""you NEVER....""

Third,  you would not see him expressing his rages to total strangers (e.g.,  road rage against strangers). Rather, the outbursts and temper tantrums  almost exclusively would be expressed against a close loved one (i.e.,  against YOU or his parents).

Fourth,  you often would see him flipping, on a dime, between adoring you and  devaluing you -- making you feel like you're oftentimes walking on  eggshells. These flips would occur in 10 seconds in response to some  minor thing you say or do. And a few hours or a week later, he could  flip back just as quickly. Are you seeing strong occurrences of all 4 of  those behaviors?",1584290660,fkkrwvc,t3_fj3qnj,/r/domesticviolence/comments/fj3qnj/what_do_i_do/fkkrwvc/,1,domesticviolence,comment
46308,throwaway_96135,t2_5xrpoxz8,"Yes, in fact this is a scarily accurate description of what he's like...

About two months after we started seeing eachother he started to fly off the handle about me spending time with family and friends. In less than a year I no longer spoke to any of my friends, apart from one female friend but that was a text-only relationship I kept hidden from him. I also started to drift from my family. He doesn't seem to like to be left alone. If one of us were busy he would insist I text and/ or call him all the time and would get mad if I didn't instantly reply.

He is very black and white, and there seems to be no middle region. 

On the outside, he is very charismatic and kind man. I've never seen him lose his temper with anyone other than me.

I constantly feel like I'm on eggshells around him. We can be having a nice time and then I'll say something or sometimes it was just if my phone beeped because I got a notification or email and it's like a switch goes off in his head. He goes from being nice and to saying he loves me, to getting mad at me and saying I'm an awful person.

46312,Sapphyreopal5,t2_13hoib,"As someone who is also on the spectrum and experienced domestic violence for 5 years, it can be difficult to see past abuse. Trusting your own feelings about a situation or person is harder than it is for others. I will tell you right now you need to start trusting those feelings. Rationalizing his bad behaviour because he doesn't always misbehave is a habit that many victims take on and end up staying. 

There IS love out there. There ARE people who will not be ashamed of who you are, your age, etc. He doesn't love you, he wants to merely control you. His claiming suicidal thoughts to make you drop everything for him is him manipulating you to cater to his will.

You're posting here because part of you knows this isn't right. Trust these feelings. I know being on the spectrum makes this difficult but please, get out NOW. The reckless driving and taking about possibly killing you both is an act of terrorism. Calling and texting you off the hook is done to intimidate.

As for school, talk to the head of your dept or even the dean to explain your situation. If you feel you will struggle explaining it, show them this post. Talk to your supervisors at work and even close associates. You will be pleasantly surprised at how much people want to help. You feel isolated now, maybe more so being on the spectrum. This is a good time to reach out and realize you're more a part of this world than you realize.

FUCK him, he'll find someone else. He might be double timing you now as he did you and his former girlfriend in the beginning for all we know. Who cares if he's having mental health problems, you come first. His issues are NOT your problem, no matter how much he wants you to think so.

As painful as this might be to read this, I'm telling you this because I want you to be happy. I might be an internet stranger you'll never meet but I know enough to say you deserve better than this.

46315,Up-Town,t2_oi79uhv,"23F, the four behaviors I describe above are red flags for  BPD  (Borderline  Personality Disorder).    Importantly, I'm not  suggesting your exBF has full-blown BPD.  Only a   professional can  determine that.  Instead, I'm  suggesting  you    consider whether he may be exhibiting a  moderate-to-strong pattern of  BPD   symptoms (i.e., may be a ""pwBPD"").

**Like a switch goes off in his head, he goes from being nice to getting mad.** 

If   your exBF is a pwBPD, he carries  enormous anger inside from   early childhood. You therefore don't have  to do a thing to CREATE  the  anger.   Rather, you only have to do or say  some minor thing that   triggers a release of anger that is already  there.  This is why a   pwBPD can   burst into a rage in only ten  seconds.  Moreover, pwBPD   have very weak control over their emotions.  Indeed, the key defining   characteristic of BPD is the inability to regulate one's own emotions. 

**He spat in my face, dragged me to his car... and started to strangle me.**

Over 30 empirical studies have found the *physical* abuse  of a partner to be strongly associated with  BPD.  One of the first   studies showing that link is a     1993 hospital  study of spousal   batterers.  It found that nearly     all  of them have a personality disorder and half of them have BPD.     See  Roger Melton's summary of that study at [50% of Batterers Have BPD](http://www.sott.net/articles/show/149774-Romeo-s-Bleeding-When-Mr-Right-Turns-Out-To-Be-Mr-Wrong).

Hence, *""Intense, inappropriate anger""* is one of  the nine defining  traits for BPD. Indeed, the terms *""anger,""  ""dangerous behavior,""* and *""unstable""* appear in 4 of the 9 symptoms for  BPD.  See [9 Traits at BPDdemystified](http://www.bpddemystified.com/what-is-bpd/symptoms/).

**Every time I tried to break it off he would tell me he would kill himself.** 

Another one those 9 BPD traits is *""Recurrent suicidal behavior, gestures,* ***threats****, or self-injurious behavior....""* 

**I constantly feel like I'm on eggshells around him.** 

This enabling behavior of walking on eggshells (to avoid triggering his anger) is harmful to both of you. It is harmful to  him because it is important he be allowed to suffer the logical  consequences of his own bad behavior and bad choices. Otherwise, you are  destroying the incentives he has to confront his own issues and seek  therapy.

It is harmful to you because, by not behaving like your true self,  you are starting to lose touch with your own self identity. This toxic  situation is why the best-selling BPD book (published in 8 languages and  targeted to the abused partners) is titled ***Stop Walking on Eggshells***.

**He is very black and white, and there seems to be no middle region.** 

If   your exBF is a pwBPD, he is capable  of loving you very intensely but it   is the very immature type of love  you see in young children.  This   means he will occasionally flip -- in   only  ten seconds -- from   Jekyll  (adoring you) to Hyde (devaluing or   hating you).  And a few   hours or days later,  he can flip back again  just as quickly.   These   rapid flips arise from a childish behavior  called *""black-white thinking.""*

Like    a  young child, a pwBPD is too emotionally immature to be able   to     handle   strong conflicting  feelings (e.g., love and hate).  This      means  he   has great difficulty tolerating ambiguities, uncertainties,      and the  other gray areas of  close interpersonal relationships. He    thus will  subconsciously split off the conflicting  feeling,     putting  it far out of  reach of his conscious mind.

With  young  children, this  ""splitting"" is  evident when the child will  adore Mommy  while she's  bringing out the  toys  but, in only ten   seconds,  will  flip to hating  Mommy when she  takes one  toy away.  Importantly,   this behavior does  not  mean that the child has  stopped  loving  Mommy.   Rather, it means  that his conscious mind is  temporarily out of  touch  with those loving feelings.

Similarly,    a pwBPD  will  categorize everyone close to him as  ""all  good""    (""with me"") or ""all bad"" (""against me"").   And he will  recategorize   someone from one polar extreme to the other  -- in just ten seconds --   based solely on a  minor  comment or action.

This     B-W  thinking also will be evident in his frequent use of   all-or-nothing  expressions such as ""You NEVER..."" and ""You ALWAYS....""     Because his close friends eventually will be ""split black,"" it  is   unusual  for a BPDer to have any really close *long-term* friends (unless they live a long distance away) even though he may have many casual friends.

**I couldn't handle his emotions.** 

If   you  have been dating a pwBPD for 6 years, consider yourself lucky that you don't feel like you're going crazy.  Because pwBPD  typically are convinced  that the  absurd allegations  coming out of  their mouths are absolutely  true --  they generally have a  greater  ""crazy-making""  effect than can  ever be  achieved by  narcissists or  sociopaths.

This is why that, of the 157 mental disorders listed in the APA's  diagnostic manual, BPD is the *one most notorious*    for making the abused partners feel like they may be losing their    minds.  Therapists typically see far more of those  abused partners --   coming in to find out if they are going insane --  than they ever see    of the pwBPD themselves.

Nothing    will drive you crazier sooner than being repeatedly abused by a partner    whom you know, to a certainty, must really love you.  The  reason  is    that you will be mistakenly convinced that, if only you can figure  out   what YOU are doing wrong, you can restore him  to that  wonderful  sweet   man you saw at the very beginning.

**He's also doing a PhD.** 

23F, the vast majority of pwBPD are ""high functioning.""  This means they typically  hold   jobs and generally get along fine with coworkers, professors, casual friends, and total strangers.  None of  those people is able to  trigger  the BPDer's fears of abandonment and  engulfment.  

There is no  close  relationship that can be abandoned and no  intimacy to trigger  the  suffocating feeling of engulfment. Hence, with most pwBPD, the strong BPD symptoms usually   appear only  when someone (e.g., a casual friend) makes the mistake of drawing close  to the pwBPD.  

This is why it is common for high functioning pwBPD to  excel in very difficult jobs such as being a social worker, teacher,  surgeon, scientist, or salesman.  And   this is why most pwBPD  can be considerate and friendly all day long to casual friends and  complete strangers --  but will go home at night to abuse the very  people who love them. 

**There is no way I will ever continue this relationship.** 

Smart decision, 23F. Yet, if you feel tempted to take him back, I would suggest you see a   psychologist to obtain a candid   professional opinion on what you're dealing with.  If you decide that strong BPD   warning signs are appearing, it is important to see YOUR OWN  psychologist, i.e., one who has not treated your exBF.  

In that way, you're   ensured that the psychologist is ethically bound to protect YOUR best   interests, not his. I mention this because therapists   generally are loath to tell a high-functioning pwBPD the name of his   disorder.  They often decide that it is not in his best interests to be   told.

Of  course,  learning to   spot BPD warning  signs will not  enable you to diagnose his  issues. Although strong BPD  symptoms are easy to  spot,  only a professional   can determine  whether they are so severe and  persistent as to   constitute a   full-blown disorder.

Yet,   like learning  warning signs for a stroke or heart attack, learning   those for  BPD may  help you avoid a very painful situation -- e.g.,    remaining  in a toxic relationship or running into the arms  of     another man  just  like him.  Learning the red  flags also can  help    you  decide when  professional guidance is needed.

I therefore suggest you take a quick look at my list of [18 BPD Warning Signs](https://www.reddit.com/user/Up-Town/comments/9hv2yq/what_are_the_primary_warning_signs_for_bpd/)  to see if most sound very familiar.

46320,throwaway_96135,t2_5xrpoxz8,"Thanks for this information Up-Town. This has actually shaken me, as about six months ago he asked me if I thought he had BPD. Me, not knowing what it was, offered to seek medical advice with him but he quickly denied it and wouldn't let me so much as mention it again without him shutting it down. Do people with BPD know when they exhibit BPD signs?

I've looked through the warning signs and he has exhibited almost all of them on a daily basis. The biggest one that gets to me is he almost always asks what I ever do for him. He will tell me I do x, y and z for you, what have you ever done to help me? This is after I have sacrificed most of my life for the last six years to try and make him happy. 

The only sign I have never seen him show is claiming his ex GFs were abusive. He would always admit fault to failed relationships but will then go on to justify his actions. I.e. he would always tell me it was his fault his relationship with his last ex (whom he was seeing at the same time as me without any of us being aware) BUT it was because she was ill so he needed to cheat for his own sake. However, he did try to claim to my roommate that I was abusing him after he strangled me. I hit him out of panic when he started to strangle me to try and get him off me, but before that I have never laid a finger on him or anyone else.

If he does show up, please do not engage or ignore his presence and call the police. You arent ruining his reputation, he is. You would be protecting yourself. Dont put his needs before your own. 

Drinking is not going to be helpful here. Its a poor coping mechanism that weakens your inhibitions and prevents your being able to protect yourself. I know its hard. Instead, do other things that are more productive and helpful as self care. Exercise if you can. Things like yoga can be very helpful at working the physical stress out of your body a bit and helping you to sleep. Try to eat on a schedule and sleep as well as you can. Clean if you can. Use headphones to play music to block out the thoughts. If they get bad, reach out to thehotline.org to talk to someone about it. 

And work on meditation and mindfulness. There is a number of phone apps out there that you can use to help you learn how to do it. It actually reduces stress and anxiety. You can also journal. Use one journal to write down all the abuse when it gets too much. If your resolve weakens, read all you wrote. Then at night right before bed, use a second journal to write down three good things that happened to you that day. Even small stuff. Then as you fall asleep imagine how you can make 3 good things happen to you the next day. 

This isnt a sprint. Its a marathon. Take it one day at a time. Focus on your well being, happiness and health. Reach out when you can for a good therapist who is experienced in treating victims of abuse. Abuse is complex, not just a bad break up. More like an addiction to the abuser. Having that objective guidance, support and validation in real life from a professional can make a big difference in your healing journey.

46337,Up-Town,t2_oi79uhv,"**Do people with BPD know when they exhibit BPD signs?**

By their very nature, BPD behaviors nearly always are invisible to the pwBPD.  He believes that these behaviors are a natural and appropriate way to defend himself against all the ""threats"" he sees all around him. This is why BPD (like the other PDs) is said to be ""egosyntonic"" -- i.e., is in such complete harmony with the needs and desires of the ego that it seems perfectly reasonable to the pwBPD.

It nonetheless is common for a pwBPD to have a vague awareness that something is not wrong because a pwBPD has low self esteem (and even self loathing at times). Moreover, there likely will be rare ""moments of clarity"" during a crisis and emotional breakdown.

During those moments -- lasting perhaps a day or two at most -- a pwBPD may suddenly become self aware and see that his behaviors are destructive and dysfunctional. Once these moments pass, however, they have no lasting effect whatsoever.

A very small share of pwBPD -- I would guess maybe 5% -- have the self awareness every day to see that their behaviors are dysfunctional. This is why a small share of pwBPD will actually seek therapy.

To be successful in therapy, however, they must also have sufficient ego strength to stay in therapy long enough -- and work hard enough -- to learn the missing coping skills (the skills they never had an opportunity to learn in childhood). Like learning to play a piano very well, acquiring those coping skills requires hard practice and weekly professional guidance for many years.

**I hit him out of panic when he started to strangle me. I don't know if claiming I'm abusive falls under this.**

No, fighting for air is not considered ""abusive."" Nor is knocking a gun out of an attacker's hand.

**On the outside, he is very charismatic and kind man.**

He likely is just as nice on the inside too. As noted above, most pwBPD  are good and caring individuals both inside and outside. Generally, that  is not an act.  They typically become abusive only when a person draws  close and intimate and thus starts triggering their fears of abandonment  and engulfment.

Importantly, the pwBPD's fear is so strong that it  distorts his perception of your intentions and motivations. This is why a  pwBPD usually does BELIEVE the outrageous accusations coming out of his  mouth. And when he is saying the exact opposite a week later, he likely believes that nonsense too.

**He almost always asks what I ever do for him.**

Again, like a young child, he very likely believes this absurd statement while he is saying it.  Because an untreated pwBPD has the emotional development of a 4 year  old, it is impossible for you -- through sacrifices and gifts -- to  build up a store of appreciation and good will on which you could later  draw during the hard times. Like a young child, his perception of you is  fully dictated by whatever intense feeling he is experiencing AT THIS  VERY MOMENT.

Hence, trying to build up a lasting store of appreciation is as  futile as trying to build a lasting sandcastle on the shore beside the  sea. It will be washed aside by the next tide of intense feelings  flooding his mind.

**How do I handle the work situation?**

If you cannot go NC, use the ""gray rock technique"" -- which essentially is to become extremely boring whenever he tries to start a conversation and answer him in very vague ways, e.g., ""Hmm, I'll have to think about that"" and ""I don't recall much of what happened there.""

Because he is bad mouthing you at work, it would be prudent to tell your supervisor that the two of you had just broken up after dating for 6 years. That alone will speak volumes. If you put anything in an email to your supervisor, it should only be something you can prove.

**About six months ago he asked me if I thought he had BPD.**

If you tell him you believe he may have BPD, his subconscious almost certainly will protect his fragile ego by projecting the accusation back onto you. Because that projection occurs entirely in the subconscious, he will truly believe that YOU are the pwBPD.

Yet, if you are a caregiver like me, it is going to be very difficult for you to walk away while leaving one stone unturned. Hence, if you feel compelled to do something, I would suggest you do what I did when leaving my exW.  I gave her a book (by Dr. Friedel) that is very popular among those rare self-aware pwBPD:   *Borderline Personality Disorder Demystified: An Essential Guide for Understanding and Living With BPD.*

Of course, because my exW lacks self awareness, she immediately concluded that I am the pwBPD -- not her. But the purchase nonetheless gave me great comfort in knowing that -- after sending her to 6 psychologists in weekly sessions for 15 years -- I had turned the last stone.

**When he's not playing mind games he's a really sweet person.**

A pwBPD typically  exhibits the   warmth, spontaneity, vulnerability,  and purity of  expressions that   otherwise are seen only in young children. As  any  parent can tell you,  young children are VERY EASY to fall  in love  with.

It  thus is not surprising that 3 of the world's most  beloved  women  --  Marilyn Monroe, Judy Garland, and Princess Diana -- all had  full-blown  BPD  if  their biographers are correct.

Indeed,    it is this childlike behavior that makes most pwBPD very hard  to  walk   away from. Because you are essentially in a parent/child relationship, leaving is so painful because it feels like you're abandoning a young  child who -- despite his frequent temper tantrums -- must dearly love  and need you.

For articles on the painful process of walking away, I recommend [Surviving a Breakup with Someone Suffering with BPD](http://bpdfamily.com/bpdresources/nk_a109.htm) and the article, [No Contact: The Right Way](http://bpdfamily.com/bpdresources/nk_a110.htm). I also suggest you take a look at the [BPDlovedones](https://old.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/) subReddit, where you will find hundreds of members sharing their experiences of living with-- and leaving -- BPD partners.

In  the right-hand column of that sub, you also will find a list of good  books and links pointing to good online resources. If you have any further questions our conversation here, I  would be glad to discuss them with you.",1584309257,fklllv2,t1_fkl3ctb,/r/domesticviolence/comments/fj3qnj/what_do_i_do/fklllv2/,1,domesticviolence,comment

They come in worried and fearful of the future. They are very anxious about their situations and usually overwhelmed. I listen, and triage their problems, and make a plan. Sometimes they just need to be told that it's going to be okay to do or where they can find resources to help. It's very satisfying to see these people succeed. That is honestly the best part of my job. My main title is actually Data Coordinator, but at a non profit, no one has just one role.

From my experience, kids can really tell when things are tense or parents aren’t getting along well. If you’re wanting to try to explain the situation to them, you can definitely emphasize safety. You could tell your kids that you didn’t feel very safe there, and how important feeling safe is. It’s hard for kids to understand a lot of this unless you have a conversation.

You could also tell them that you don’t want them to love their dad any less, but that he wasn’t always nice to you/hurt you, so you wanted to protect and stand up for yourself (kinda like a bully). I know you don’t necessarily want to affect their relationship with their dad, but it’s also a really reachable moment for them.

46822,nephatwork,t2_k0g1x,"I emailed my landlord when I was in a similar situation, explaining that I was planning to leave, the psychotic stuff I was dealing with, what I was afraid of him doing. They were totally unsympathetic (this was Canada) but they didn't know I was an American and that I was going to be leaving the country...and nothing bad happened to me, yet. I was the only source of income for our ""family"" as well. (btw, he went on welfare within a week of me leaving him).

Right at the end I got raped and whipped with a charging cord and walked my happy ass to the police station. They said they would have to visit my apartment and talk to him about the allegations, so I decided not to file a report. I knew that I would be there when they came and I knew what he would do to me when they left...so I just left while he was sleeping 4 years ago and haven't looked back. 

The first time I tried to leave while he was awake and he smashed his head into the floor over and over again, that was probably 10 years ago...he wasn't THAT bad yet, I thought, so I went to help him because I thought maybe it was just a psychotic episode or something. The second time, he held a knife to me, probably 6 years ago. I didn't give him a third chance to stop me. I used to go to bed every night afraid he would strangle me in my sleep. I planned for a while and waited for my chance to get out.

Break your lease. Call the cops, they're trained to handle this stuff, and anything he does or doesn't do is on him, not on you. My ex threatened to burn down the building all the time, but he didn't, he lived there peacefully for a few years after I left and moved on to a new place since then, it was all just to make me afraid, he's actually the coward he accused me of being all along. Do what you need to do for YOU, and get evidence if you can. Your life is more important than some money or some temporary discomfort.",1584273401,fkk4qya,t3_fiy9x3,/r/domesticviolence/comments/fiy9x3/how_do_i_get_him_to_leave/fkk4qya/,1,domesticviolence,comment
46823,jewels275,t2_1eicrb1b,After you get out of work go to domestic abuse services in your area. Have those ladies help you fill out your emergency protection order. They will file it with the courthouse. Wait there until the judge makes it official. While you are waiting. Call your landlord. Have your landlord get a new lock ready for your door.  When you have heard the judge signed the order. Have the police escort you to your home. While the police are in your home the cops will make him pack up his belongings.  But make sure you add that you would like a police to be there to make sure he leaves with his things in the order.  Once he is gone have the landlord come over and change your locks.   If you feel your not safe in that apartment ask your landlord if he has any other apartments you can move to.,1584276115,fkk7f41,t3_fiy9x3,/r/domesticviolence/comments/fiy9x3/how_do_i_get_him_to_leave/fkk7f41/,1,domesticviolence,comment
