If it's completely rotten or mangled it'd be better. Maybe they would just show them what I was wearing at the moment and I dress pretty distinctively so that would be easy. I just don't want anyone other than law enforcement and the funeral workers to see my body but however I look at it that's kind of unavoidable even if it's closed casket. Another thing I would hate is that my mom would be at my funeral blaming it on everyone else except her when it's mostly her fault. And my brother would be sad because I'm the only person he has left in the family who actually gives a fuck about him but with how things are looking I won't be caring about that for too long. My friends think I'm happy and doing well because I went to therapy for a long time but that is not the case.

When I was 10 years old, I went onto Minecraft, hopped on a server, and tried to make some friends. I met a guy (who I will call V) and we hit it off pretty well. Fast forward about a year and we’re great friends, we do dumb role plays together a lot and talk almost every day.
There’s a problem with this, though. At the age of 8 I found out that porn existed, at 10 I was almost obsessed with sexual stuff and would talk about it a lot with my friends.
My friend V never questioned what I said or did, he never wondered if I was too young to know what I did, he never told me that what I was doing was wrong.
Few years later, I’m now 13. I hadn’t talked to V in about a year, and then suddenly he just appears online again. We hit it off again, good friends, etc etc.
Then he tells me that he’s in love with me.
Then I tell him that I might be in love with him.
Then we start virtually dating.
He made a lot of sex jokes and told me that he really wanted to fuck me almost every day, after learning that I’m trans he said that he wanted to see my breasts before I had my operation (i’m FTM) and that he wanted me to “dominate him” after getting bottom surgery as long as I keep my breasts.
I was 13-14, he was 16 or 18.
We broke up after he said that he wanted me to send him nudes, I gave him a week to try to prove that he was a good person and then we drifted apart, I have been thinking about this every day since it happened.
Was I groomed? Was I abused? Was it pedophilia or ebebtigoephilia or whatever?
I don’t have the answer to any of these.
If anyone does, I would really like the help, and I’m sorry if this is the wrong place to post this.
Thank you for reading, and have an amazing day.",SuicideWatch,"I don’t know where to post this, but I hope that this is it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/hde50j/i_dont_know_where_to_post_this_but_i_hope_that/,True

There's another subreddit post listing all the thoughts that go through someone's mind when they're suicidal. All thoughts I share myself.

I've had low grade depression all my life, low self esteem and the inability to make friends, all which have caused trouble in my nearly 13 year marriage. A marriage that is potentially ended with her actively looking for apartments with a goal of moving out by the 1st.

The short of it is I took alot of the things she said defensively as if she was attacking me and she put up with it for longer than she should have. She is the most amazing woman I've ever met, beautiful on the inside and out. I'd beg her to stay, but done that before and it's selfish. I love her too much to potentially cause her more pain...

Which leads to my dilemma, I want to find a way to kill myself that would look like an accident to lessen the emotional fallout after my death, for my wife, mother, grandmother and other family. Not wanting to be alive is something I've struggled with all my life and now that I've  screwed up the most wonderful thing in the world there's really no point in living. 

Most ways have risks that it won't be successful, resulting in permanent, debilitating conditions, like taking pills, poisoning, jumping off a building/bridge/etc., using a gun (something I'd never do), vehicle accident, etc.

15,homeinthevoid,t2_703jbdml,1592773597,hdejm0,2,/r/SuicideWatch/comments/hdejm0/at_this_point_again/,1,"Although there were many signs early on, it's been maybe 15 years now since the depression and suicidal thoughts started. Between then and now I've had dozens of impulses, attempts, hospitalizations, not to mention countless acts of varying degrees of self destruction. No one even knows about it except my parents and siblings, all of whom have little contact with me because they despise me and blame me for everything. I never had a youth, my teenage years are just a blur of isolation and despair and abandonment, I'm on my way out of my twenties feeling just as hopeless. I've never been in a relationship, and I have very very few friends (well, just my one friend of seven years, up til they blocked me recently).

Things were doing okay for a while and now I'm back here again. It always happens this way. But this time feels different. I'm ready and this time I won't fail. In the span of a couple weeks, my best friend abandoned me after I offered to help them through a tough time (I made a mistake and opened up to them about some personal things), my therapist discharged me because of a difference in opinion on things outside of my therapy (my psychiatrist also discharged me a few months back because nothing seemed to be working), and I have absolutely no one to talk to. I won't call a helpline because they will call the police when I tell them how I really feel and then I'll get dragged back to the hospital. Where I live, the hospital is not a good place to be. One of the head nurses knows me from being there multiple times and actually has a vendetta against me (I know how crazy that sounds. But that's just par for the course when it comes to all the things that have happened in my life). There's no one at all I can get help from, honestly, except other suicidal people I've met and I just can't be responsible for putting them over the edge, as tempting as it is to bleed myself out to them. I believe the emotional and mental darkness in me is responsible for my loneliness and social ineptitude. This darkness feels extremely volatile (I mean in the sense that sharing the burden with anyone could hurt them deeply), like I'm a dementor that can suck the happiness out of everyone. I have actually been described by people as 'negative,' 'a black hole,' and even 'the grim reaper.' It's like I exist to hurt everyone around me.

I have a lot more issues than being lonely, isolated, and terrible at socializing. I have a disorder that is excruciating to deal with and I spent 20+ years of my life suffering in silence without any help at all. My primary symptom is extremely powerful emotions and emotional pain influenced by my environment. I can only describe it as like being covered in open wounds, only emotionally, though it sometimes manifests in physical symptoms. I feel like no one else could ever understand what this feels like. Some would say I am incurable, or at least that's what I believe. Supposedly it can be managed by meds and therapy but that has never worked for me.

The past few months I could feel the suicidal thoughts creeping back in and the last few days I have been in that pit-of-despair, pre-attempt mode that is so familiar to me by now. I blew up my mom's phone with texts last night (I'm always telling her about my suicidal ideation and she usually responds with silence or criticism, which is fine because at least I know she won't call the police). I told her how I feel about a lot of things and I think some of what I said was hurtful. She didn't text back. So I told her that I was really done this time and asked if she would please take care of my pets when I'm gone. She texted me ""do what you have to do"" but said she would dump my pets at a shelter. 

I was planning since Friday to kill myself this morning but it's now afternoon. I was so desperate yesterday for a reason not to do it that I texted my mom and said if she calls me and talks to me I would not go through with it. But she ignored my texts. I even tried calling her and she didn't answer. I look at my pets and feel extremely sad for them. Maybe they will be lucky to find homes that don't treat non-human animals like toys/objects and won't be used as dog-fighting bait. But no one will ever care about them like I do, or know the right way to pet them, or know what toys are their favorite like I do. Animals are the only beings I can relate to and I care about and understand them in a way I feel that other humans don't. But I honestly feel like I can't go on. Especially now that I said all those things to my mom and she basically proved my point that no one gives a shit if I die. I can't bear the thought of going back to work tomorrow at the job I hate and I've already used up all my sick time last week because I couldn't even get out of bed. I've completely given up on taking care of myself and my apartment. The thought of waking up to another day is absolutely terrifying to me. 

My life is pointless, worthless, disgusting, unbearable, cringey, hopeless. Occasionally I feel hopeful and I actually try, but I always end up crashing. I'm here in this place again, the cycle never ends, and the void is calling me home. I know I have only one option and no one else could ever understand. I don't even know why I'm posting here for help, probably because deep down I really don't want to die. Maybe someone here will know what this feels like. I just hope I don't make anyone else hurt by posting this. I know I sound really self absorbed (I am).

I saw some people posting 10 things that would have missed if they did it, tried to do the same but stopped when the bad things outnumbered the good ones quickly (and the good ones were mostly irrelevant).

I feel like a hamster running in a wheel, a lot of effort everyday for absolute nothing in return and I cannot stop.

Feeling lonely, unhappy, with a void in my heart/soul that I cannot fill up with nothing, only trying to do it with materialism.

If someone is reading this and is worried, as I said, they adjusted my meds so at least by now I’m not gonna do anything serious.

I've spent 14 years waiting for the magical ""It gets better"" that everyone promises... It doesn't seem to be happening, and not for lack of trying. I've just finished writing two full pages of a note, simply detailing why I can't keep going. That doesn't even include the apologies and the messages and the goodbyes. When I finished it, I took a deep breath and thought, ""What do I do now? How do I do it?"" As the tears rolled down my face. So I came here.

I've been suicidal for 14 years, and I always end up going to the internet when it gets really bad. So many times, Google has directed me here. I decided it would be easier to just make an account. If I break any rules, please tell me and I'll fix it. I feel bad for posting here and adding to the well of pain, making it harder on the few who are here to help, but I have nowhere else to turn at this point. I hope you can forgive me.

For a long time, I didn't know why life was so hard for me, or why so many adults asked me if I'd been the victim of sexual assault. My mother actually burst into tears one day and said ""It is 90 degrees outside, you CAN'T wear that jacket! They are going to take you away from me if you keep hiding all of your skin!"" I was the only poor girl at a rich school; the other kids didn't understand me. The boys would pretend to ask me out on dates as a dare and pretend like they were vomiting if I said yes, the girls would do their unspoken Mean Girls thing where they stare me down as they walked past. Par for the course, right? Everyone gets bullied. Then came the lesbian rumors, which of course prompted the boys to ""test"" it. Let's just say I've had my fair share of extreme sexual harassment, bordering on assault. Then the anatomy classes compared assault victims to an old piece of tape that's lost its stick, or a chewed up piece of gum that no one wanted.

By the time I reached college I had a very negative opinion of the male species. A few horrible traumas later and I'm sitting in a therapist's office with a diagnosis of CPTSD and generalized anxiety disorder, working on memory therapy... And I start to remember my childhood for the first time. And it was polluted with frequent visits to the church basement. With the elders. And all the other little girls. Turns out I was the victim of religious cult brainwashing and torture. Yes, that's a real thing, and I battle with the programming they put in my head literally daily.

I haven't had a good life. Always waiting for the ""it gets better."" And better never comes.

Now, I'm 26. The stress of my life over the 26 years has destroyed my body. I have severe fibromyalgia, possibly Sjogren's Syndrome and a whole host of other issues that I can't get diagnosed because I'm too sick to work and I need money to get medical help in this country. I can hardly walk to the kitchen to maintain some semblance of blood sugar stability. I pass out if I shower while standing. Anything I eat makes me horribly sick. I'm starting to show symptoms of kidney, liver and pancreas diseases. Too sick to work, so I'm too poor to see a doctor, so I'm too sick to work. Ad infinitum. In a month, I'm going to be forced to move back in with the same family who took me to that cult every weekend.

My life will never get better. I've tried every government support program and been rejected from all of them. I cannot make it out of my family's house. That will be where I die, listening to them scream at me for not being a good Christian woman and finding a good Christian man. Scream at me for not finding a job regardless of how immobile and sick I am. Work from home jobs are a lie and working for yourself is this mythical thing that only a chosen few in thousands can effectively do, and definitely not the sick and disabled. I'd told myself that the only thing that might make life worth living is love, but who would love someone like me? Sick, damaged, carrying a host of mental disabilities and will never work again? No. No man would have patience with my trauma concerning intimacy and I would never feel safe being with a woman, because of that religious programming screaming in my head that I am evil and I will burn.

I don't know what to do. I can't keep going and I can't move in with my family. I just want to end it.

Today while doing the dishes I daydreamed about slitting my wrists, getting in my car and listening to my favorite music as I bleed out. It sounds blissful. 

Yesterday after a fight with my boyfriend I imagined myself popping sleeping pills and going to his house, curling up in his bed to die as he remains blissfully unaware, playing video games on his computer. It seems blissful. 

I’m romanticizing it again. The thing is I feel like I’m having an out of body experience, or like there’s a part of me feeling this, and a party of me watching myself feel this. And neither part knows what to do.

I’ve always dreamt of killing myself as this release from the pain. That I would do it and so many people would miss me and love me, and I should leave behind individual notes for every single person I knew as a final token of my time here on Earth. I would leave them with my final thoughts. And I would write a memoir of some of the horrible things I had to witness.

People would read this and finally I would make sense to them. Finally they would understand why I am the way I am and my suicide would be understood. 

But now I don’t feel any desire or need to tell anyone anything. Now I want to slink away into the void and it’s better if no one even knew I was gone. It would be better if the very, very few people that even know I exist never knew what happened to me. To disappear entirely. 

I have no family anymore. No one I consider family. Just a few friends, and please don’t type to me how they will miss me because time and time again in my life it has been proven that truly no one has ever cared. They might care but only to a tiny degree. Not enough to stop me. Not enough for me to want to stop myself.

So here is the plan :

I will build my own personal coffin. I may not have the skills necessary to build it well or sufficiently however I’m sure I’m capable of creating something that will work. 

The me who exists today isn’t suicidal,
I’m not enacting this plan now or even soon. But future me who will be completing this plan, I will choose a location to rest permanently. 

Once I have my location I will dig the hole in my resting place myself. I will place my coffin there and bury it. Then the hard part, and where I need your help with improving this so maybe I don’t need someone else... 

My plan right now is to hire someone to bury me once I’ve passed. I don’t want to be found. I don’t want anyone to know I’m even gone much less where my body is. 

I hope to find someone who would/could be paid off to bury my coffin. Potentially a person who needs money, which I would leave taped to my coffin.. 

So I’m alone, in a remote and hidden location that people don’t often visit. I am locked inside a coffin with which I can’t escape. Then once I’m gone (few days) this individual appears and throws dirt on top of me and I am hidden for all of eternity.

No one knows I’m gone. Messages, texts, calls, they all go unanswered. No one has heard from me. No one knows where I’m at. I’ve disappeared. Gone like a ghost. The perfect getaway.

I've spent the past year in an absurdly damaging and draining work program, occupying up to 80 hours or more per week of my time.

i personally just know i have something wrong with me etc. and i have diagnosed anxiety and deppression but i have medication for that and i still want to go. 

aaaaand i think i could be bpd i have these fucking awesome moodswings from ((happy"""" to angry to good to bad to happy to angry to suicidal.. etc. This morning i was happy for sometime, then minor inconvenience .. and i was angry ... like angry angry and i just yelled and complained about evefything related to the thing that occured. after that i was kind of irritated but kind of doing good at the same time. Annnd later i was so against myself drinking alcohol but yeah i drank and was pretty drunk, i still am :D 

I WAS HAPPY AND EVEFYTHING i like this one person and i felt so close to him but as we seperated and i was alone all thesd thoughts came again like.. ""he doesnt like me"" "" i am stupid to think that they would ever want me.."" etc. 

as i was drowning in self pity i started to think about everything else too death and all that, because when i am sober i have the thought of death too most of the times, but i come to my senses about every people around me and all the things i wouldn't be able to achieve. 

Sometimes i just go to sleep or smth after that, but like now i just think about the stuff like, why the fuck i would need to achieve anything because im going to die anyways, and when i die all of my achievements will be pointless, and everything else is just going to be pointless. why live this pointless life and die when you can just die? why the fuck not to kill myself, if i dont commit suicide today maybe tomorrow will be better but it's still pointless and i always come back to these thoughts. Or maybe tomorrow it will be better and i have the strenght to try to achieve my pointless desires and then i get hit by a car, or have a stroke or something else that results to my death.

maybe someone will be sad after that or mad for being so young to die, but why the fuck. 

I am going to die anyway, maybe not today or not tomorrow or not even in 40 years, but someday and then everything i did in my life will be pointless, i just wake up in some endless void or there is nothing, or there is heaven and hell or i born again in different life... etc.

i have tried to find reason for life, its not love its just fucks me up even more, living your best life is too hard for me because i want to die, and everytime i take something, drugs, alcohol, i have the reason, bevause i don't think about this stuff i just live and do everything and don't really think anything like this. 

And I don't think anyone should kill themselves but at the same time i think I should and everyone else who does that i'm not really against it ... its so confusing even tho these are my thoughts...

     I’m not gonna ask you guys for reasons why I shouldn’t kill myself. And I don’t want any crap like “suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem” cause you don’t know me so who the hell are you to decide that. I don’t even know why I’m posting this. I don’t really have anyone to reach out to and I think I might just want at least one solid person I can actually talk to without feeling judged or scared they might tell someone. 
       
     I’ve told some of my friends about how I’ve been feeling lately but I don’t think they know how to handle this information. They might not even be taking it seriously. My family doesn’t know and I don’t wish to elaborate on that unless someone asks. I’ve tried talking to my school counselor but she’s always so busy. It took her three weeks to find time to talk to me this one time and the first time I had met with her she had gone and told my parents. She’s a nice lady and all but is she even allowed to do that? It had made things worse for me. I hadn’t even mentioned anything about killing or harming myself. Just said I’ve been sad.
       
     I can’t even cry properly anymore guys. And I’ve wanted to harm myself with blades but I’m too scared that someone might find out so I’ve  just resorted to scratching myself or pinching without leaving any lasting marks. It’s kind of sad that I’m this much of a coward. I’ve researched suicide and all the methods and I’ve decided on either shooting myself, wrapping a big filled with only helium around my head, or take a bottle of pills I’ve forgotten the name of. They’re suppose to be pretty strong and I’ve researched the amount it takes to kill you. The problem is I don’t have access to any of these materials and theres always the chance of my survival. When I kill myself I want it to be 100% guaranteed. I don’t want to wake up in the hospital and be forced to go to a psychiatric ward or anything. They wouldn’t allow me to kill myself and would probably make everything worse.
       
     I honestly just wish I had never been born. It’s stupid that we have to be forced into this world and not be allowed to take our own life. We’re all gonna die one day so why does it even matter? I’ve seen a lot of people talk about giving euthanasia to terminally ill people but what about people with mental illnesses? Just because you can’t physically see it doesn’t make it any less terrible. I’ve heard people say things like how people with mental illnesses shouldn’t be allowed to commit suicide because they are not right in the head but does that mean you should force them to live out a life they have no interest in living? Just try putting yourself in their shoes. Don’t call them selfish. What’s really selfish is forcing a person to live because you don’t want to feels sad. It’s like you’re making a person with depression live just so that you don’t have to.
       
     I just hate it. I really do. I don’t understand why I can’t be allowed to die. Honestly it’s not like the world would end if I die. I understand my family and friends might be sad after that but they’ll move in eventually. I might just leave when I turn 18 and then kill myself so they won’t have to deal with my dead body. I won’t tell them where I’m going and I’ll just disappear and put a bullet in my head the next day. But that means I would have to wait 5 years. I don’t know what to do anymore.

Instead, I’m writing to leave my last words.

This will be lengthy, and honestly isn’t worth the concern or attention of most. I hope, though, you’ll leave it up. 

My intention is to link this post in an email that will send tomorrow morning, ideally 12+ hours after I’ve made my attempt. That way… Well, my body won’t be left unfound for days or weeks, and if my attempt fails (which I hope it doesn’t) – then perhaps I can be saved. 

So… Circumstances first, yes?

I have pretty severe OCD (centrally manifesting as contamination fears) and depression. This pandemic has been immensely challenging for me. I was already immensely isolated, but suddenly that isolation became more absolute (for lack of a better word). While my neurotic-mind did begin generating fears of catching Covid19, that fear didn’t really ‘take hold’ as much as I feared it would. Instead, what became the more constant anxiety-provoking problem was my inability to obtain simple supplies my OCD demanded I use in excess: cleaning supplies, disposable gloves, some toiletries…

If that was the worst of it, things would be approaching a greater degree of balance as stores begin to adapt to the increasing demands on their stock.

Instead, other challenges have found me…lost, and overwhelmed even as some circumstances began improving.

My therapist and psychiatrist work out of the same office – and despite having two forms of insurance (Medicare and Blue Cross Blue Shield) there are limitations to what they cover. Meaning… My treatment has been building a past-due balance that I can’t afford to pay down. Now my therapist/shrink have informed me they will not honor further appointments without that balance being resolved (in part or in total). I still have a couple months of prescription refills, but now I have no foundation of medical care to lean on.

And then… Two weeks ago (right when my therapist stopped upholding my appointments) I had a major plumbing problem. Actual human waste began backing up my shower drain. I spent money I didn’t have getting the most immediate problem fixed, but was given a bill for another $800 to fix the entire problem. A family member, in immense generosity, helped me cover a portion of the expense. But the remainder will wipe out most of what I have in my checking account, leaving me unable to pay my other bills.

Having to clean the shower after the immediate problem was fixed… I don’t even know how to describe the anxiety. I used so much bleach my eyes were teared and blurry. I felt like I couldn’t breathe. I kept gagging, struggling not to vomit. And when I finally finished all the cleaning, I had to shower for over 90 minutes – coming out…broken and exhausted, and just collapsing in bed.

I’m having to pause every few moments as I write this because I’m breaking down sobbing.

I’m to the point where I can’t fix my financial affairs, I don’t have a therapist/shrink anymore, I can’t even come close to maintaining my environment as my OCD demands… And I’m dealing with all of this in nearly complete isolation.

I’ve had moments where few things in my life brought me joy. But only fleetingly has \*nothing\* brought me joy. That’s the continuous moment of despair I find myself trapped in now: unable to find anything that acts as a light in the otherwise exceedingly pervasive darkness.

There are things I should do before ending my life.

Preparations I should make, words I should offer, feelings I should voice, and apologizes I should give.

…but for the most part? I can’t.

As I’m writing this, its 4:27 PM in my area. I was supposed to have a telehealth appointment with my therapist between 4 PM &amp; 5 PM. I tried to call their office about a half dozen times today – hoping to offer some tiny payment in the hopes they would honor the appointment their automated system still lists. I just got voice mail and busy signals.

That was my last hand reaching out for help.

I know - I could call 911. But I don’t want empty, meaningless words from a stranger and a rapid escort to a hospital.

To my loved ones…

I’m sorry. I know those words will ring hollow, but they’re sincere. This isn’t anyone’s fault, apart from my own. I know saying that does little to ease this reality, but it’s true. I’ve made this choice, and none of you are remotely responsible. I’m sorry for the chaos and mess I leave in my wake.

I love you.",SuicideWatch,"These will be, I suspect, the last words I'll leave. I hope they find their way to my loved ones.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/hbmimh/these_will_be_i_suspect_the_last_words_ill_leave/,True

&amp;#x200B;

Point 1: It's a permanent solution to a temporary problem.

And? My house has an ant problem right now. That's temporary, because we have ant traps and poison and stuff to kill the ants. If you told me ""I have a permanent solution to your ant problem"", I wouldn't be like ""no, temporary problems should never be solved permanently."" I would say ""oh, cool, glad I can permanently solve it.""

Also, the fact that all of my  problems will end when I eventually die of heart disease, cancer, lower respiratory infection, or a stroke doesn't make them trivial from my perspective, since from my perspective, my lifespan encompasses essentially all of time.

&amp;#x200B;

Point 2: You don't actually want to die, you just want relief from your problems, and relief is a feeling, which you can only feel when you're alive.

This is just straight up not true of me. I periodically become overwhelmed with emotion, become unable to focus on anything, and get an irresistible urge to injure myself. If that were to stop happening, I wouldn't feel ""relief"" because these episodes only occur periodically anyway. 

I have no real goals or aspirations and can't imagine a future where I'd be content. If this ceased to be the case, I wouldn't feel ""relief"", because I would then be faced with the hard work of actually working towards those goals, aspirations, and imagined futures.

I want to not have to face my problems anymore, not to ""feel relief"" from them.

&amp;#x200B;

Point 3:  As long as you believe you'll never be happy, you won't be.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, as long as I'll never be happy, I'll believe I'll never be happy. If changing my behaviors is difficult, how is changing my beliefs supposed to be any easier? I at least have some sense of conscious control over my actions, even if, on a deeper level, that conscious control feels like a paper thing illusion plastered over me doing whatever dumb stuff my brain shits out. There's not even an ILLUSION of direct control over my beliefs, so this statement basically amounts to ""You're depressed because you're depressed, and to stop being depressed you must simply stop being depressed."" which, fuckin genius, never would have thought of that, thanks.

&amp;#x200B;

Point 4: All you have to do is stay alive.

&amp;#x200B;

That's NOT all I have to do though. As soon as I'm no longer immediately suicidal, ""all I'll have to do"" will involve fixing myself, developing goals and aspirations, and becoming a contributing member of society, you know, all the stuff I feel incapable of doing and have no motivation to do anyway. This kind of line always makes me feel like a member of a cult trying to leave and then suddenly being confronted once again with the same rhetoric given to new recruits about how easy and rewarding the cult's practices are.",SuicideWatch,Most anti-suicide rhetoric is condescending bull,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/hbmu7a/most_antisuicide_rhetoric_is_condescending_bull/,True

I am 28 I live in Canada and minus a few construction jobs where I made 18 or so an hour I have always worked for minimum wage, which at least I can survive on $14 an hour is what in getting right now. I have never done any post secondary because I am awful at schooling, I fail pretty much every year I have taken so I am not willing to risk the massive amount of money that post secondary takes.
The only redeemable thing about me that I can think of is that I am good with money, making $14 an hour I have no debt of any kind I live with a roommate and manage to pay all my bills.
But I am honestly at a loss for what to do with myself, I don't see a point in living another 50 years if i am just going to making just enough to pay my bills and be alone but I honestly don't know what if anything I am capable of accomplishing.

She doesn’t help my mom pay any bills but my mom doesn’t want to put her out. She has also manipulated me and mom for our personal information and ran up alot of money on things she hasn’t paid for in my mothers name.

I’m unemployed but i’m a student at a university that I hate and I’m getting bullied here to after leaving the community college I was at in 2018. It just sucks because I have to look out for myself. I have enemies that I don’t want. I get harrassed at home and school. People randomly say they hate me and I wish I didn’t care but I kinda do because i’m a nice person who doesn’t bother people.

I guess I’m writing this now just to finally get it all off my chest. If I’m being honest, I don’t think I have a lot left in me, but hey maybe someone here will be able to help. 

I first realized I had depression in 7th grade. I realized that it wasn’t normal to always be sad; and it definitely wasn’t normal to have constant thoughts of killing myself. Fast forward 7 years and I’m still having these thoughts every single day. It’s easy to say now that I should’ve tried to get help in the last 7 years but the truth is I don’t know who I would talk. I have a terrible relationship with my family (I think the fact that they’ve never noticed that i’ve been depressed these last 7 years is indicative of that), I don’t have any friends that I’m close to, and I don’t have money for therapy. I’ve only ever told one person and that ended up making my depression 100x worse but that’s a story for another day. 

Life went on and I learned to live with it. It didn’t really affect my life, and I was great at hiding it. During the day I would be the happy guy that always had a smile on his face, but every night i’d be crying myself to sleep. That’s pretty much how all of high school went. 

Anyways this last year I felt like my depression was progressively getting worse. I began losing hope that I was ever gonna get better. And then, in a desperate attempt to put some hope into my heart, I decided to fall in love with a girl. And not just any girl, my closest friend. I fell super hard and put all my hope that everything was gonna be okay some day into her. I guess my depressed mind mistook every signal that was there and thought she liked me back so I decided to be honest with her and told her about how I felt. Not only did my plan backfire and she said she didn’t like me back, she also said it would be best if we took a break from talking. 


So yeah that was a week ago and now I have nothing left. I have no friends and no one to talk to. My depression is at an all time high. I literally can’t function anymore. I wrote a rough draft of a suicide note, planning on finishing that up later. So yeah that’s where i’m at right now. No more hope. 

I would just end it all right now but I’m too pussy to do that cuz “I don’t want to burden my family” and blah blah blah. I really don’t know what to do anymore, i’ve never been this low.

I would prefer not to go into great detail, but I guess you can say it's the usual problems people run into that make them feel overwhelmed.

For as long as I can remember I have felt like dying would be so comforting, like I'm not cut out for life and that all this bullshit I deal with from people around me is just not worth it. I have looked up every way a person could kill themselves hoping that maybe, just maybe, one time a different answer would come up that didnt seem so scary and unsure. For years and years I have searched every part of the internet for an answer that would not seem hard to pull off, or too painful or scary to execute. 

It all comes in waves, but I never truly feel happy even when I'm feeling my ""best."" Like I have wasted my life. I feel like not a single person in my life understands me and I feel so alone and helpless. 
Even the people closest to me will never understand me, and I really feel that dying would be the only escape from this stupid life. i just simply dont want to live it anymore. I am so frustrated, and all I do is sit alone and cry.

I have not and probably wont go to anyone for help, because no one in my life will understand or they will tell me I'm being dramatic or that it's not that bad. I also wont reach out for help because I refuse to be thrown in a psych ward.
Everyone in my life makes their problems out to be more severe and important than mine would ever be, so how do you go to anyone for help or to vent?

I am just getting my feelings out here, I am not really expecting anyone to have any magical answers for me and that's okay, I know there aren't any anyways.

Most of the time, it's been passive, like wanting to die but not taking active steps to end it. But there have been flare-ups, once when my brother died in 2011 from alcoholism, and another major one in 2014 when I took on way more than I could handle with work, school, friends, etc. 

I noticed when I talked to friends and family about this issue, which wasn't very many, they appeared more concerned about keep me alive than actually helping with the issue. 

Why convince me to stay alive when what I needed from you was someone to talk to without being crushed for all the things I havent done in life? Why would someone say, ""Please don't do that, we'd all miss you"" when that person and everyone else never reaches out to me, has abandoned me, and forgotten me when I needed someone to just acknowledge I existed? Why is it after I told my parents and a select few of my friends about my suicidal thoughts, that they immediately jump to guilt-tripping me, instead actually giving me an ounce of the fucking emotional support I needed from you all those years ago? Why not help now? 

I get frustrated, because it comes across as fake, disingenuous, and half-hearted in their attempts to ACTUALLY help you feel better, than trying to convince you to stick around. 

If not for my therapist, I would be dead right now. She listens to me, and actually tries to help me. Never has she guilt tripped me for my suicidal ideation, because these are feelings I can't ignore or say is just a product of a chemical imbalance. And even with her, I'm still not recovered. 

What would help more than a professional I pay to listen to me and help me? If the people I loved and cherished would listen, would reach out, would take actual action instead of the bullshit tokenism I get when this was brought up.

Sorry for the long post, tldr in the end. 

Someone suggested I post this on this subreddit so here it is. 

Context: I'm 26, unemployed though have a great degree, have been abused my whole life by family and bullies and teachers alike, have a wild array of mental illnesses caused by that.

I ran away from home and moved in with my boyfriend (to his dad's house) who is an amazing person generally. The thing is, he broke up with his previous gf to be with me. We have a past going way back, and we sort of just fell in love again when we talked again after several years. He didn't have time to grieve the loss of that relationship, which he's doing now. He told me he misses her and he doesn't usually think about her, but when he starts thinking he can't stop.

He also learned his lifelong best friend had been hitting on this ex, breaking one of the biggest bro codes. Well, he learned that a few hours after I saw on his phone that he had texted his ex saying he missed her. I told him that's unacceptable and it won't happen again or I'm gone. 

I know a lot of people will say just break up with him now but I'm not going to. He deserves a chance to grieve a relationship that he ended on bad terms, and I'm accepting this one fuck up as nothing more than a fuck up. He doesn't have any other bad points yet that would have me end my relationship and for me this is just human nature. 

The thing is, since this happened, I have a whole lot of bad thoughts. My eating disorder I feel is relapsing, and I've been in recovery for about a year now and all that might go to waste. I can't afford to see my therapist at the moment since neither me nor my boyfriend have any proper income, only some allowance from parents.

I constantly have thoughts like ""I've never been happy, all the people I should be able to trust wholeheartedly has hurt me one way or another, what's the point in staying alive?"" or ""If I were dead I wouldn't need to deal with all this shit."" I haven't been this suicidal in maybe a year as well. I had been recovering on a lot of levels.

I was used to being suicidal all the time before but I've been okay for so long now that I have no idea how to handle this. I keep taking xanax (prescribed to me alongside an antidepressant) but I'm running out and I don't want to keep taking it and develop an addiction. I don't know what to do with myself once the thoughts come out.

How to deal with being suicidal? Or intrusive thoughts? Any advice is appreciated.

Ever since this pandemic started my life us falling apart.
I lost 3 months of my scholarship, I don't have money, I am drowning in stress from university, I am unable to function and study well at home. All I wanted was to move out to university dorms next year but now it's lost and I'm stuck at home far away from everyone. 

I haven't spoken to a single human being I know in person since March. I've only spoken to my family. The only real life conversation I had was an argument with a classmate since we can't work together. I am so lonely it's destroying my sanity. Everyone I talk to daily (by chat) ditches me when I try to open up. All my attempts to initiate conversations just die since I message people and they just ignored me. My loneliness is killing me. 

I lost my therapy because if the pandemic and I don't even have who to whine to. I could never open up to her anyway. I've distanced myself from all of my on-line friends before the pandemic because I was dealing with very difficult mental issues i couldn't bring myself to even talk about in therapy. I am so lonely I only wish for death.

3 months ago I had a falling out with 2 friends who I've known for a decade. One of the last things one of them told was was ""enjoy having a friendless miserable life"". They were right. This is my life. I have nothing. I never had anything besides online friendships and I've lost them too. Fucked them all up. I tried to kill myself 2 weeks after that but I failed pathetically, really pathetically. I am currently living a friendless miserable life. That is what I am. I am failing at university. I have no hopes for my future. I have no dreams and aspirations. All I wanted is to have some fun before I inevitably go. It's all gone now... all the little I had and the little I hoped for is gone. I go on walks every day trying to find the courage to go missing, to jump in front of a truck, to plan a train suicide. This pathetic life is not worth living.

I am a nowhere human. When I was a child, I experienced so much social and academic failure that I simply gave up on life. It's too late for me, now. I am permanently unformed.

I can't drive. I literally miss stop signs because of how little I focus on anything. I can't work anywhere; I get so upset by any kind of adversity or aggression that I have a breakdown. I have to go to a commuter school, because I can't live on my own or with other people outside of my family, because I can't handle any kind of interpersonal conflict or feelings of inferiority without eventually breaking down over it. When I experience any pain or discomfort, I start to cry. I'm a large, 21 year old man, and I start sobbing like a child when something starts hurting. I don't know why I'm like this.

I do not interact with other people. I have no frame of reference for it. The internet is the only tolerable medium by which I might interact with anyone, and even then, I truly don't understand what to say to people or what to think of what they tell me.

They both have drinking problems and when they drink that’s when the abuse starts.

I get the best thing to do would be to get her away from him. But she lives 10 hours from immediate family and has no job due to COVID. Another problem being, I don’t think she will accept help. She is the eldest of the 3 sisters and wouldn’t want to reveal these things, as it would make her feel vulnerable. I just have no idea what to do and I want to stop her from doing anything.

So i decided lets try and find a job and see what will happend. Problem is that my IBS is becoming worse and worse with an insane pain that there are days i cant even go out because of.

I started having suicidal thoughts pretty much everyday, its the only thing that feels like the corrent answer for everything  Its been 3 years since i dropped out and every summer i go through hell trying to decide if i should return to  studying or find something suitable. Every time anxiety attacks, stress from missing our,fear of the future, sleep sleep deprivation and im also dealing with a shit tone of other health related problems.. Last summer i dont think there was a night id slept for more than 3 hours, lost around 8-10 Kilos from not eating. Since last week its been the same. I already feel unwell, im having shortness of breath and a really weird fealing in my chest. Honestly the only thing i want right now is to die. I dont really find any enjoyable thing to do, i lost most of my friends, future seems rought and dull. I just want to feel happy for once or the depression and anxiety to stop.

Life is way too hard. I don’t understand how anyone can be happy with having to spend most of their time working. I just graduated high school and am going to have to spend the next few years stressed out in university. Then, when I’m done there, I get to go be stressed out at a job instead. Yay. Fuck, even the process of selecting and enrolling in university courses makes me feel frustrated enough to punch a wall, and hopeless enough to want to cry. I had a privileged upbringing and loving parents, and my university tuition will likely be completely paid for without me having to take out any student loans - I’ve had it so much easier than so many other people. Yet, I always feel like everything I face is far too challenging for me to deal with. I am so weak.

Nothing in my life is worth fighting through the bullshit to experience. Killing myself would be so easy - I have access to a whole locker full of guns. And yet, I can never bring myself to do it, because I am too scared of the moment I will blink out forever.

So instead, I have to keep fighting, one day after another, receiving nothing for my efforts but more stress and more feelings of complete hopelessness. Having OCD and GAD certainly doesn’t help.

I want to go, but can’t, because I am a coward. I think a lot of people would kill to have things as easy as I do, but instead of being happy about it, I have spent so much time wishing that I was never born.

The thing is, I don’t even have clinical depression. I see a therapist, and, while I was diagnosed with OCD and GAD, I was not diagnosed with depression after taking a test. Everything that I feel, I feel because I am weak, not because of any sort of chemical imbalance in my brain.

I spend so much time wishing for things to get better, and they never, ever do.

I used to be someone quite social, to go to the gym, to wear nice clothes, make up and jewelry, to try to do my best at work and school, prepare myself a solid life that was compliant with my needs, tastes and beliefs. And in half a year, I just lost everything, I feel rejected by everyone because I don’t have the nerves to pretend I am doing okay in front of all the friends we shared and who I miss so much. I became sort of a toxic monster, I fear that any acquaintance thinks I am a stupid bitch, I am just ashamed that someone I care so deeply and genuinely about threw me to the trash without any hesitation. What does it say about me ? No one in my close circles will ever need me, be happy to be with me, ask me for advice, or anything. And as the situation evolves, I am afraid of feeling this huge anger building up inside of me making me becoming petty and resentful against everyone because I just felt too much rejection, when I don’t believe I deserved. But who am I to say what I deserve ? 

The very fact that someone can just stop caring at all about somebody who were their best friend and partner is beyond my capacity of rationality. I cannot imagine building anything now that I just lost so much, and I am just tired to hear anybody say « you’ll be fine ». I am NOT fine, I spent the last few months at my parents’, going to the therapist, taking stupid medications that are not more useful than tic-tacs because sadness is not a disease and I cannot just « put this in perspective ». I am TIRED of everything and of judging myself for feeling so low. I tried to alert friends, family, my ex, his family because I care about them so much and I cannot imagine that I am just out of the picture now. And I am just done. I am tired of this bullshit that « you know love may disappear without anyone being at fault », I cannot picture life like this where bonds we share with others are just so contingent and fragile.

And so I decided I couldn’t take it anymore, these last few months have been absolutely hell and have only made me so unmotivated and I came to the conclusion that I choose death over living which is an extremely hard pill to swallow I guess. So I had it planned out and was so close to following through with it when I just decided that I have so much to look forward too! And it came at the right moment my little epiphany that I ran to my moms room and told her everything (except on my plans to actually end it) and I just cried in her arms like I never have before.

I told him i have problems in family. I get money they lend me their cars the buy me food and clothes. I just cant tell them i dont want those things. I want a kind word. A hug. I love you.

They get mad, yell at me im sick i need to get help. I do something and its always wrong.

I've decided I definitely cannot ever do that to my dad. Other people love me, I'm not deluded about that. But they would get over it. My dad would never be okay, no matter how stupid I think that is, so I can't do it. 

He's young and healthy so he has at least a couple more decades left. And I'm happy for him. I want him to enjoy his retirement and all of the things he's worked so hard for. But I want to die so badly that sometimes I resent that, sometimes I resent the fact that he has so much time ahead of him because that means I have to be along for the ride. 

Distancing myself doesn't work. I haven't called him in two weeks, I live in a different city, but we've gone longer without talking and it hasn't changed anything. Sometimes I pick fights and try to get him to hate me and that doesn't work. We are really different people with different value systems so you would think it would be easy but it isn't. 

He thinks we're close and in some ways we are. I can't go to extremes with alienating my family because I truly believe my dad would figure it out. He'd know what I was doing, that it was out of character for me, he'd put it together.

There is no way -- without severely hurting innocent people -- that I can convince my family to truly hate me and not care about me at all, with no chance of redemption. Some friends, sure. But even my friendships are more resilient than I gave them credit for. I've certainly tried to ruin them in the name of saving my friends the heartache of knowing me before. And sometimes I get cold feet, and I think I need them, or I feel bad that I'm hurting them. I fade out or, on my very worst days, I snap at people, but I always apologize or come back. I know it would ultimately be better on them to not have me in their lives, but there's no way to do that without hurting them a little bit in the short term, and that's so hard to do.

So basically I'm just pushing people away and hurting them for no reason. Because I never do it *enough* to be able to act on it. I don't want to hurt anyone, but I know I am, so I'm trying to minimize that as much as possible. I don't know why I can't commit.  So I've stopped doing that. I am a polite, if distant, friend to everybody. I'm not pushing people away but I'm certainly not inviting them in. I'll let my current friends hang around, but I'm not inviting them into my inner life, I'm not letting them get any more invested in me than they already are, and I'm not making new friends. I have way too many people to let down already.

So, I'm not going to kill myself anytime soon. But I really want to. But like where do you go from here? If I called a suicide hotline or a therapist and was like ""hey I cannot stop thinking about suicide and it's the first and last thing I think about every day, and my favorite solution to every problem, and I have written and rewritten personalized notes to everyone I know, and it's truly ruining my life because it's all I can think about... but I won't act on it for at least 20 years"" they're gonna be like ""uh, call back in 20 years then."" 

There are people in the world with more emergent needs than I, and I get that. I just feel so stuck, because no matter how desperate and miserable I feel, I'm not going anywhere, so what's the point? Suicide is a problem because you *die,* and suicidal ideation is a problem because you *might die*, but if I'm confident that I won't actually die then what am I doing talking about it? What is the point? 

I considered taking a mental health day from work today, but like what would I say? I know I don't have to tell them. But what would I say to myself? I needed a day to sit around and be sad, even though I have no intention of acting on my feelings? Am I supposed to take mental health days for the next 20 years? Like, what is the point if I have no endgame? 

But I should be working right now and instead I'm sobbing and posting stuff on an alt for no reason. I don't even know why, it's just a particularly bad day, but nothing has really happened to trigger that. I had a long zoom meeting this morning and spent the whole thing writing random stream of consciousness suicidal stuff and then scribbling it out. I felt like I had to because those thoughts were going to get out, and if I didn't write them down I might say them out loud when I went to say something else. Like I had to contain them. I've been doing that a lot lately. Not just at work, I hung up on a friend the other day even though I missed him and wanted to keep talking because I was afraid I'd say something suicidey. 

This has all been incredibly fractured and incoherent and I'm very sorry to anyone who actually read it.

Sorry if my english isn't good btw. 

I don't know what to say or think right now. I need something, anything, any advice or help.

I can't describe everything thats going wrong right now, but I'll try to tell the worst things.

I have recently been having really crazy mood swings and very little energy alongside with weird eye problems. Also i have little to no interest in anything that I used to like. The mood swings are weird, they can come up at any moment, even if I am having a great time. Just a sudden feeling of emptiness and realization that everything is and will always be worthless.

So today I fell off my motorcycle/moped(don't know what others refer it to as) when braking and i guess the wheels or brakes somehow locked and the concequences are bad. I bruises my left shoulder, arm and knee pretty badly. I had recently made some adjustments to my moped with my friend that insurance wont like and neither does my dad. I now have to revert it back to normal and I don't even know how to do that. The mopeds steering thing got bent and it also received minor bruices on the paint. 

Some consequences also include:
I am terrified of driving ever again. 

I feel anxious and I am just in a constant state of fear. 

I can't go to the gym because it hurts to do any physical activity or exercise.

I don't have a way to make it to my summer job. I have to have a moped with me there, which i may not have when i have work again and I also cant work because of my injuries.

Oh and also the job is literal hell.

My dad is really fucking pissed off.

I can't go fast anymore.

I know these may not sound so bad to you, but for a 16 year old that is not rich and doesn't have everything going perfect at the moment it is pretty bad. 
I believe that everything happens for a reason and that everyone on earth gets equal happiness in their life, but this accident made me rethink this. 

I just can't believe this could happen to me.

I see a lot of posts on here with people explaining how external and uncontrollable factors have led them down this road. I can definitely relate but this alone isn't something that has made me contemplate suicide. 

In my own case, it is all my fault. I've let everybody down, including myself. I'm in my 30s and haven't accomplished much, infact my 20s were extremely self-destructive and I burned way too many bridges with friends and close family. There is no support system for me. I have a tendency of convincing myself that my actions are acceptable and warranted. Frankly, this couldn't be any further from the truth.

One example would be that once my mother passed away, I fled my hometown instead of supporting my father and sister. I flew to the other side of the world in a vain attempt to leave the pain I was feeling behind and it did work, for a few years. I returned home 5 years later with nothing to show for my time abroad. I drank too much, did drugs, partied like crazy. 

I don't talk about my feelings, put on a smile and pretend everything is okay because I'm scared I'll be sent to the looney bin if I open up. Lately, it has just gotten too much. I don't drink very often anymore but recently went to a family event and was extremely rude and aggressive to the host - probably has something to do with bottling my emotions instead of confronting them. I don't remember any of it but my behavior has left me with a level of self-disgust and shame that I wouldn't wish on my worse enemies. If you saw me in the street or had a conversation with me, I'd come across as a very well put together person but mentally I'm deteriorating at a very rapid rate. 

My funds have been dwindling as I've been unable to work but I am thinking of flying out to a country on the other side of the world, paying somebody to inject me with a lethal dose of opiates and fade away, then get rid of my body so nobody can find out what a coward I really am. Apologies if I've broken any of the community rules - I just feel a need to put what I'm going through into words.",SuicideWatch,Departing soon,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/h913f2/departing_soon/,True

She supports gay people, but not bi, trans, pan, ace, ect.. She has been putting me down for years and I can't leave here yet. 

She constantly tells me to ""just get over it"" even when my depression is eating me alive and I can barely get out of bed, let alone deal with her shit. She constantly says she's ""showing me tough love"" by forcing me to get up and do everything when I can barely stand in the shower.

But after i got kicked out if college i got really ill with depression and was just generally shit. I eventually got a live in job near London but after two momths i had to quit because my anxiety had gotten so bad i kept having anxiety attacks.

Ive been to multiple different therapists, been on multiple different medications only to have them make me worse or have no effect, ive tried alternative therapies and meditation.

My experience of it was similar to that of a density curve if I were to put on a graph. It started mild, got progressively worse until it peaked. During it's peak I had mental breakdowns near everyday and came to close to killing myself many times. With each breakdown I lost a piece of myself, and from this point on my mind started to slowly repress my feelings until I reached as close to apathy as I could come. I grew more and more apathetic, something was inflicting unending emotional and psychological pain and the only way to cope was to numb down my emotional quotient all together.

At this point I literally can not bring myself to care about anything and if I go on like this I'm going to die young from my sedentary and otherwise unhealthy lifestyle.

When I (M32) was in high school I didn't have (many) friends. I got bullied a lot. Every so often I went to sleep crying and wanting to take my life. But every time I had those thoughts I pictured my own funeral and my parents where always there and I thought to myself, next day will be better. At the end of the week I would think next week will be better, than next month, next year... Anyways it never did, although I had some good moments as well.

At the end of high school I went to uni and things were better. I had real friends. This was all new to me, and those friends didn't seem real to me, I always thought myself as a bystander, but had great times with them. At the end of uni I was together with a girl and she wanted to study a semester abroad to Zimbabwe. I went along and did some volunteer work there. After two months we broke up, she ended up seeing someone local. Back home I did not end my thesis and never got my masters degree. (I did obtain my bachelor's degree.)

Back home I got depressed and went to therapy for a few months/year. Afterwards I got my life back together.

Current story:

Four years ago I met my now ex (27F) girlfriend. She was the best thing that ever happened to me. I found a good job at that time and after a few months we bought a house together. She even convinced me to finish my thesis and so I did. I'm still so proud of myself I did this and so happy she pushed me to do this and kept me motivated to do this while both working full time.

At the end of previous year we were talking about having a child together and a few months later she was pregnant. Everything was perfect until the 13th of March (no kidding and it was a Friday, and the start of the quarantine), she called me in panic and told me she has been bleeding. We went to the doctor and took blood test, her HCG values were not good (hormone indicating you are pregnant.) After that day we went every two days to the doctor and the specialist. They did not know what to do, the values were increasing but not enough and said the unborn child would die and leave the body naturally. Anyways it did not and we decided to put it in motion chemically, but it did not work so we did it surgically. After surgery things did not improve, and they though something was still left. So they suggested chemotherapy because apparently that also has a side effect to clean the uterus. A day into the treatment she had massive stomach aches, and we divided to wait a day and see. Next day she had the same pain and we went to the hospital again. She needed to go to surgery immediately because there was an embryo stuck in here fallopian tube, apparently it was a twin. If they did not remove it immediately, or if we waited longer she would have died. Surgery went ok, but we had some post surgery issues...

Anyways during that period I tried to stay positive the best I could but she was broken and so was I. Because of Covid we could do nothing. I couldn't even be with here in the hospital, I would not see doctors, I was helpless. We had no escape, only ourselves at home.

Shortly after we broke up.

But now she has someone new. I friend I know from sport club. We play together often and I see him multiple times a week (in non covid timeline.) Now I feel left out and don't even know what to do or say if I would see them together. No one from the sports club even knows...

And now I just want two things:

I want to go to sleep, just be in an endless peaceful sleep, I'm just so tired pretending everything is fine... A few months ago I was still thinking I would be a dad, now I'm left with nothing.

Or I just want to lie in bed with someone behind me saying everything will be fine. Someone I can completely trust again and hoping I will be together with that person forever. But I went through some much already and I just so tired always pretending I'll be ok.

28 old male from scandinavia
Brother is mentally ill, same as me, but has previously had anger issues which stems from my father. Even some violent episodes in the past towards my mom. Which I guess he learned from my father. These anger issues has seeped down from my father, to my bother, to me. I have not been violent though .And we have both forgiven him and love him.
I have had, or still have, body dysmorphia, to some degree. Have been very thin at some points.
I have struggled with addiction. Mainly downers such as opiates, benzo's and alcohol. 
I don't even know my own sexual orientation. I thought I did, but I do not. 
I struggle with low self worth.
Last year everything just went off the rails, I had i giant fight with my dad while I was drunk and on drugs. After calling me my brothers name a couple of times, just as a forgetful thing I guess, I snapped. Where I blamed him for not being in my life, I feel terrible about it, I trashed some of his stuff and pushed him and we even wrestled on the floor. Luckily none of us got hurt. I have apologised many times to him afterwards and he forgives me. But that's not even the worst of it. As the insecure guy I am, my cousins ex and I had a fling, she at first came a little on to me after they broke up. And then I developed feelings for her and we had a short lived fling, which I feel terrible about because I did not tell my cousin. They have now found more or less back together, I don't know how much, but I feel like a horrible human being, for having the fling in the first place. The whole thing revealed just how insecure and messed up I am. I feel terribly guilty. My cousin has forgiven me but I cannot forgive myself. I fell in love with her. Or I think I did, maybe I was just so lonely that I needed some human intimacy, and therefore went though with it. I don't even know what my sexual orientation is. Life keeps on complicating, I cannot see a future for myself. I have no energy and have had a suicide attempt last year. I think I might just od on morphine or heroin in my future, because it seems so terribly bleak. I'm sorry, this is messy. I just needed to vent.

Life has been tough, is tough and it is never getting easy.

My past is a mess, and I suffer the consequences (ptsd, depression, self harm, etc.). It haunts me.

My present is rubbish. My health is too. I suffer with chronic pain.
No friends, and unable to make them due to hyper vigilance and trust issues.
No family left, just my mom, who lives 1000miles away from me and has been  (and is) toxic.

 I still keep in touch with her just to feel a bit rooted to the world.
Just to feel something is still holding me here.

My fiancé is too good for me. I am not enough and he would be better off if I was dead.

Too much to recall and remember, and nothing good.
Too much pain. It doesn't get better.

Today my mom told me (in a friendly conversation about my physical health through the phone) that apparently she has life insurance that covers me (which I didn't know) and that she is ready for me to die whenever because life is tough and one needs to be selfish, and she is not bothered to suffer for anyone but herself.

She knows I have had a mental health crisis lately, and that I am not doing well.
She knows I self harm and have done it in the past although she pretends she doesn't know and gaslights me to tell me I don't do it.

It is too much. Today I had several plans on how to end my life, and what to write in a good bye letter.

I am too scared and coward  to act on my suicidal thoughts but this tightness in the chest doesn't go away and I cannot stop crying. 

I am not in immediate danger. Just my head keeps haunting me.
I don't matter.

I've been struggling to cope with all the things that have happened this year combined with my 'normal' mental health issues. The other day I had a trigger that pulled me out of the void of ignorance. Since this, I've been feeling a lot of intense feelings and like everything has finally caught up to me.

I spent some time the other day frozen in this internalized state of mind, like I was stuck inside my mind. During this I just decided to set a date for killing myself. I don't know if it will happen. I gave myself an out just in case.

Anyway, those events I have been so vague about happening? Well, let us get started! First things first, housing. For the last few months I've been squatting (paying a little bit to my roommate) to stay in the spare room of her apartment. Then the other day, the door to my room was locked during an inspection (I had to empty the room and hide my stuff) and in this complex, you're only given a key for the front door and specific room you are staying in. So now I'm moving back in with my mom. The issue here; however, is my mom is still living with her ex-boyfriend as she struggles to find a house she can afford (150k range in PA but can't find anything that looks like it could be her last house as she is now almost 60). So, I'm going to moving in there. The ex doesn't seem to mind me but we butt heads politically and morally. So, I've just been feeling a lot of shame over not having a place and having to rely on the support of others who are not so willing.

Back in Feb. my now ex-gf's dad died. I was there for it all. I did everything I could to be supportive and it was hard as the ex was obviously and understandably distraught. A lot of days without talking and being yelled out occurred until she ended the relationship a couple months later. This as a whole was rough but I could've handled it if not for the fact that...

During all this time, I had put hours into applying for a position after graduation and was doing testing, background checks, and such for it only to be told 'no' because I smoked pot 10 months prior. I was rejected the day before the breakup.

Also during all of this, I fell behind in coursework and currently still have incompletes on my transcript and have not officially graduated.

So, I currently have very little money, have not finished college, have been losing friends (over voicing my support for the current movement and from being both emotionally distant from the stress and physically distant due to coronavirus).

I know what needs to be done to finish everything up and get back on track but I've lost the energy to do so. The past two years of college, I had started to regret my major and only continued so I could get out of college instead of spending more time and money on a different major.

Everything just feels too much lately. I know it's really not but I cannot, again, find any motivation to continue.

I watched my mother suffer my whole life, I'm scared the same will be me.

I am, without a shadow of a doubt, one of the most sick, twisted, malicious, and evil people to be walking around the planet. My thoughts and fantasies, intrusive or not, are incredibly disturbing. But my actions and the numerous crimes I've committed this past decade are even more sickening. I was born with what I call a ""delayed sense of morality."" Meaning, I only perceived things as ""good"" or ""bad"" based on the perceives consequences rendered onto *myself*, and not how they affect others. This led me to acting like the ""good kid"", but only to advance my own goals and others perception of me. I was raised in an extremely dysfunctional home with my parents fighting every single night. Up until very recently, I had virtually zero altruistic qualities. With that in mind, lets begin confessing the depths of my depravity. I am a horrible, wretched individual.

By Age 7, I had already:

\-Stolen another person's poem and won a poetry contest with it.

\-Lied to my parents about ""inventing"" great things.

\-Beaten and bullied many of my friends, including tormenting an autistic girl with one of my friends.

\-Shoplifted

\-Abused my first cat by squeezing him until he meowed and threw him down the stairs, as well as hitting him (I did this with another cat as well).

\-Picked up and hurled my cousin over the trampoline net

\-Lied to my mother and deleted her emails when I got in trouble.

\-Faked being sick

\-Flashed myself at my friends (I got in MASSIVE trouble for that).

\-Refused to work with an Indian girl because ""she was brown.""

\-Almost had sex with my own sister. Mostly sibling experimentation.

When I left elementary school and entered middle school, at 11, the attacks to my narcissistic ego made me even worse. It was also around this time I discovered porn. I remember one of the first fantasies I had was the girl I bullied entering my room, nude, and mounting me. This was the start of a long period of sexual deviancy. My grandfather's death when I was 12 made me develop a new coping mechanism to reception of pain: Dissociation and numbing. When something bad happens, my brain numbs it immediately and I become unmoved by it. This mechanism defined my ability to commit increasingly vile actions over time, as well as normalize twisted thoughts. I also developed a bad temper as initially a means to control and intimidate others, but over time, it became genuine. Here are the LONG list of absolutely depraved and sickening things I've thought or done. I'm getting a black pit of shame in my stomach as I'm typing this.

\-Slandered a girl I had a crush on's name because I was afraid she'd reject me. I sent my jock prep friends to bully her over social media. I stalked her for a period of three plus years. I never made any contact but I did drive around her town several times to see if I could find her. My intentions were not to harm but to simply reconnect. I also helped a friend of mine stalk an ""ex"" of his.

\-Psychologically and emotionally abused my first ""girlfriend"" (it was online, we never actually met up but we did have each other's phone numbers) by faking being in life threatening situations. I got off her emotional distress and it made me feel ""in control."" When I was done with my ""puppet"", as I named her, I just lied about changing numbers and cut all contact.

\-Got into extremely volatile fights with my family members. Some of them have resulted in injuries. We threw knives and other weapons at each other. I once got pepper sprayed by my own sister for throwing a metal shovel and it landing in the wall. My mother and father alike have broken and destroyed stuff around the house. We all possess violent tempers.

\-In high school, I became lazy and did not want to do any work. My mother, a nervous wreck, asked me why and I lied to her and spun a web of deceit, resulting in explosive fights, all over my fear of telling the truth.

\-I beat up someone in high school for simply being ""annoying.""

\-I drew out elaborate plans to fake my own death. At the beginning of senior year in high school, I felt as though I was dealt an unfair hand in life and wanted to start anew elsewhere. I had an elaborate plan to drive my car off a bridge, blow it up, but bail before I was caught in the explosion. The disgusting part is that I also wanted to get off to people crying over me.

\-I attempted satanic rituals and was a heavy blasphemer. I wanted to get possessed and tried praying to lucifer for a natural disaster. One did happen, approximately a week later, but killed no one. I have tried to attempt other supernatural rituals

\-I was an extreme sexual deviant and coomer with a masturbation addiction going on for almost a decade. I masturbated \*daily\* I had developed every disgusting and vile sexual fetish you can conceptualize. I was a bi-incest-biasto-sadistic-zoo-paedo-necrophile. Growing up, I sexually experimented with my male cousin for almost a year. I was 13, and he was 12. Although he initiated first, by the end, I was in control. We did everything you can think of besides literal anal sex. I watched extreme bestiality videos of animals fucking each other, and humans. My obsession knew no boundaries and I attempted to fuck my cat in the ass on several occasions. I also attempted to spy on my sister on several occasions, mainly in the shower. This was due to an obsession over the aforementioned childhood sexual experience with her. Eventually, normal porn wasn't giving me the rush I needed for masturbation. I got into hentai, tentacle porn, drawn and animated bestiality, loli and shota. I used to take quick glances down the shirts of girls as young as three. Eventually, even that wasn't enough. I got into rape and child porn, and masturbated to those things. Never downloaded, distributed, or made it, I just saw pictures. The pics ranged from everything from teenagers, to models, to literal toddler rape. I stopped though at some point and reported every single website I saw, as well as the means to access them. As for my fantasies, they were so depraved and disturbing that I felt as though my soul was rotted, some of them involved corpses, infants, and foetuses. I have never actually sexually assaulted another human being before. I lost my virginity at 19 years of age to my friends trans asian girlfriend while they were together. She cheated on him with me in this manner twice.

\-I developed murder fantasies and obsessions for most of my time growing up. I became obsessed with horror movies and imagined myself as the killer, inspiring fear in other people. I purchased a $300 scream costume, and buck 120, and would carry it around in my bad for ""emergencies."" I showed people images of gore, impalement, and dead bodies. I spent quite a lot of time in the guidance office because of it. At one point I was so obsessed I began dreaming of indiscriminately murdering anyone and everyone, from infants to the elderly. I threatened my cousins with an ax, chased them around with knives and even cut open a dead squirrel my cat brought home to ""immerse myself."" I also threatened to kill my immediate family members several times. Despite this, I have seen (and jerked off to) several videos of murder including One Lunatic One Icepick, ISIL beheading videos, Three Guys one hammer, etc (no, I did not download or share them). Despite all this, I never actually followed through and killed anyone though, mostly due to the fact that I knew it was something you couldn't turn back from.

I want to make it abundantly clear that I no longer do \*\*\*any\*\*\* of these things and hold extreme shame, guilt, and remorse over them. I've always hated myself, but now my obsession with my dark past has led to suicidal feelings and relentless self-condemnation. The sick, twisted thoughts re-emerged as a result of my recent obsession with my misdeeds, but this time they're intrusive. I had an anxiety attack over one of them recently. My brain told me ""You should kill yourself right now"" and ""You're an abomination."" It plagued me all day at work. I don't want to be beyond redemption. I got tired of spreading so much misery and victimizing others. I've confided in friends about my horrible conduct and their willingness to stay with me has given me a newfound appreciation for life that I previously didn't have. I've thought about going to therapy and asking for ways to handle the great deal of emotional pain that comes with remorse, as well as trying to re-sensitize myself. I know somewhere in my blackened heart there's empathy, but I don't allow myself to feel it because I fear I ""won't survive it"" if that makes sense. I fear the pain will be too much to bear.

This is based on my experience and observation, not necessarily applies to all cases. 

This is for the ignorants. Most suicidal people do not give a damn about what they are going to leave on earth. Talk about materialistic value (possession, job, status quo) that the person has achieved or could achieve, you will give nothing but a feeling of disgust accompanied with intensified repulsive view on the world from the suicidal's perspective. The only things that add up to their consideration are their emotional connection to the close one and the very consequence after death itself TO THEM, not to what they are going to leave on earth. Even some are willing to cut these emotional attachment. 

Religion and sugarcoat advice will go over their head. They have seen, experienced, endure the rough part of life and had enough of it. Speak about the possible opportunity and future, they will not buy it. They have realized that it will be nothing but a momentary break before the suicidal thought strikes back. Most won't even bother to work for it, simply because it doesn't matter to them. Regarding to advice of taking medical treatment and therapy, most have taken these long before, comes to no avail. Some won't even bother. As an additional insight, in most third world country the concept of mental therapy is highly unfamiliar except for those who have the privilege of possessing above average level of wealth. 

This is for the hypocrites. Usually this is experienced by a suicidal with a still functioning social life. Take this example, or perhaps try it yourself. No one will give a damn about you until out of sudden you starts to give everyone a depressed look. Then when being asked about it, pour the magic ""I'll end my life in a week or two"" sentence. Now you are a king among your inner circle. Suddenly your parents indulge you, appreciate your achievement that they used to not give a shit about. Your friends become pseudo saint in front of you. People you barely know starts to act as if they are your longtime friend. Strangers on the internet suddenly love you. Then you recover, start to have the will to live. Bet my ass, they'll drop their act as soon as you drop yours. Ironic isn't it? Death attracts compassion, will to live attracts assholes. 

If you really do care and want to help instead of exposing your superiority complex to the desperados, simply LISTEN and try to understand. That is more than enough. If you want to give advice, make sure you understand his standpoint, the problem, your standpoint and last but not least, WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT. Believe me, if you have never experienced any intense prolonged pain of have had enough with everything, you could barely scratch the idea of it. If you don't really care, stay in your goddamn business instead of pretending to care only to disappoint once they have the will to live. 

And oh don't get me started on the idea of arguing. Argue with the suicidal person about why they should not commit suicide will do them a favor of convincing them even more to take their life.

My two cents:
Open their mind, NOT direct;
Listen and understand, NOT lecture.

I got diagnosed with adhd and started taking meds everyday. For a while they were way to strong and I didn’t have any emotions at all. I continues going to my psychiatrist for about a year and a half. I’m 8th grade my older sister and here boyfriend went to college. They were some of my best friends at the time and both still are. But with them being gone I got super depressed. I talked to my dad about it and we decided to remove anything I could harm myself with easily; like knives and scissors, from our house and locked them in our garage. 

I told my parents I wanted to go back to my psychiatrist. I went to here bi weekly for about 8 months. My parents didn’t think anything was coming from it and with it being fairly expensive I stopped my freshman year of high school. I continued to take the same medication this entire time. I never talked to my parents about being depressed or wanting to kill myself again after that night in 8th grade. It mad them so sad that I felt that way that I wanted them to think everything is okay so they don’t have to worry.

I am 22 now and I’m still depressed all the time. Over the last year I’ve been very suicidal. I think about death all the time. At work, with my friends, with my family, etc. I have really bad social anxiety. I get super nervous and hide under my sweatshirt hood 24/7. 

I am in school and still to this day am taking adhd meds but I don’t think it helps with anything other than school work. When I’m on it I get things done fast and efficient but my depression and thoughts of suicide are constantly on my mind.

I don't get along with my aunt, I don't wanna see her around the baby because she's toxic af. I just don't wanna be around her. So I told my grandpa that if he wants to come to MY house to see the baby, he can't bring my aunt with him.
Damn was I stupid.
He told me I was disrespectful to my family member's legacy, that he would have wanted me to be better and more polite.
That hurt like hell. Since he passed away , I have DONE EVERYTHING IN MY POWER to be respectful to his memory. To let EVERYONE see the baby , but my aunt posted pictures of the baby online when the mother said not to. She WAS DISRESPECTFUL, she was the one who was rude.
And he said that my depression had no reason to be, that I'm a crybaby and other shit.
AFTER THAT, he called my mama and said shit to her . He made her cry.
My mom of course put the blame on me. Because she doesn't know what her father said to me.
I'm not okay . I have done everything in my power to be better, to not let the mourning consume me, when every second I wish I had been killed instead of my family member . To have been at the wrong moment and  place , just so my nephew could have a father.

i don’t know how much longer i can take this, its driving me insane, i’m not even allowed in my room anymore because its their “punishment” to me for misbehaving, i sleep in the living room couch now. i’m at my limit, i have nobody to talk to i can’t see a psychiatrist or therapist because i don’t have insurance and my parents wont let me get insurance if i talk about it they yell at me.

Shes had chronic pelvic pain for ~3 years following a rape and follow-on promiscuity in attempts to cope. Around February this year the pain kicked into overdrive due to a reaction from a medicine. She has been dealing with urinary frequency and retention at times along with general horrific muscular pain. Weve gone to a million doctors and have finally found a support team full of some top notch individuals. (She has Pelvic Floor Dysfunction and PFD induced interstitial cystitis along with extreme sensitivities to side effects from medication) Her primary care dr, OBGYN, Physical Therapist, accupuncturist, Phycotherapist, and Hypnotherapist have really ushered some progression in since April which is great. 

Sadly, the pain is still around, albiet, less than in Feb but its still not great. Recently, due to an increase in pain and sleeplessness, shes having 2 to 3 panic attacks each day and starting to really concern me about suicide again as weve started talking about that daily during the panic attacks. All the Drs. and therapists are aware of all the details and are working with her on it. We just started her on an SSRI that shouldnt cause any urinary retention but we have to wait for it to kick in.. and if she has any urinary symptoms during this time, i fear it may be falsely correlated with the SSRI. Which then she would want to stop taking...

In all honesty this whole situation scares me because am always concerned about her well being when im sleeping or at work. I feel like i spend almost all of my time in the day trying to keep her alive. Im fighting a battle of my own trying not to lose hope and trying to find ways to keep her mental in a good state through her pain. I really just dont know where to go from here. She wants immediate relief, which i cant blame her for, but I dont know how to provide it. Or even find someone who could at this point. Im scared that she may actually attempt suicide, and im at the point where i want to start hiding things from her (some drugs that she doesnt need that she can OD on are already hidden). I know that isnt the right answer, even hiding the drugs. Im just at a loss now. And i dont know how many more times I can take her on walks and calm her down. That tactic has been working but its not a long term solution. None of this is. I just dont know what to do next to keep her alive. What do you do after youve gotten someone what feels like all the support and they still want to leave the earth?

There is nothing to my name. I don't have a future. And my health is getting even worse. Before, it was only my feet that would turn black and blue with white toenails out of nowhere. But now it's getting to my hands, too. And I've got that dumb cyst in my right hand, which makes drawing even more difficult. I can't even stand upright, cause my feet, neck and spine are too weak to carry me. I probably won't be able to go to school again. I can't even buy groceries on my own. Or do anything, really. Even just talking, and touching things hurts my body.              

 Idk how I'm supposed to integrate into this world, if I can't even use my body to live. Having any sort of relationship sounds exhausting. I'm not even a good person to be around. Nobody wants to talk to me anyways, so. I really just want to draw more. Idk what else I will do. I don't even know if my health is going to get worse to the point of death. Maybe I'm just being a bit of a hypochondriac. But then again, I did almost die from a rare disease at 15. Guess my health was never really good to begin with.                

Doctors don't really care about me, maybe cause my family's poor, maybe because they don't want to look deeper into it, who knows. I honestly don't want anyone to remember me after I die. What's the point? With the way that I ended up presenting myself, I'd rather want all those memories erased from this world forever. I didn't even get to live a somewhat peaceful and authentic life until recently. Everything before that was kind of a waste, really.        

It wasn't who I wanted to be, or should have been, and thinking about those times makes my toes curl. And I also hate getting flashbacks of an old man calling me onto his lap, while my mom defends him in court. I'm not saying this for the pity party, I really just don't want any more of those kinds of memories. I wanted to learn french or italian, but there's no room in my head for that, if everything's full of abuse. I wish I could be an android, then time would me mine, and I could simply delete everything that I don't need. Or block it at least, idk. Also, I don't like sleep anymore. I wish I never had to sleep again. I would have even more time, then.             

If I can't even life on my own, and if I don't know how to integrate into this society, then what's the point? I'm useless. But yeah, life's my responsibility.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not sure if everyone has these thoughts, maybe everyone wishes they weren't here on the inside. Either way, I am looking for advice. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been thinking about suicide for a year now and I need it to stop. I feel this way because of school mainly, my mum is a doctor so obviously there is lots of academic pressure, she got 12 As in her GCSEs and 4 A\* in A levels and I often think to myself that there is no way I can possibly live up to her in any way, this resulted in me putting myself under lots of pressure to succeed in exams, often not letting myself eat if I got below a C, and to be fair to myself, I did see results, but at the cost of my mental health.

Furthermore, my house doesn't have any farther figure because he left a few years ago to start a new life in Australia and after reading the studies I concluded that this plays a large part in these feelings. School feels as tho it is slowly eating away at me. My school utilizes the cruel practice of 'streaming' which is the idea that students should be grouped tother based on academic performance, with little regard for the well-being of the students who will be labeled as at the 'bottom'. It is hard to be motivated to wake up 5 days a week to go to school, knowing that you are at the bottom. A dunce. 

In a world where anyone can be anything, it seems diabolical that such a dystopian system can be put into practice while being unscrutinized. The schooling system in the U.K is not only cruel but dehumanizing particularly to those who may under-perform. 

As many may know, right now is exam season in the U.K, which has led to me having these dark thoughts in record numbers, and I am scared that one day, I might just crack under the pressure and end it all. But at least for now, I recognize that it would be a foolish thing to do.

If I am complaining about nothing (Which there is a high chance I am), just tell me to stop complaining and shut the f\*\*\* up. But I still need advice on how I can exit this dead-end of destructive thoughts and mannerisms before its to late to turn back. 

My final thought concludes that we all have people and things to live for, amazing memories that deserve to be remembered for years to come and new experiences that no matter your current situation, will happen one day soon. We just need to be reminded of that sometimes. Which is why I turn to you.

I'm in an abusive not-marraige, I can't tell anyone what's happening to me or they'd try to help and make it worse. 

My kids have to deal with me being absent mentally and barely functional because of whats happening... And a long history of C-PTSD and depression on my end.

I love my children so much. I hide all this from them, they are too little and it would damage them immensely to know what was really happening.

I didn't want kids, not when I had them. I knew it was too soon...

But I didn't have the courage to abort. (Hyper religious upbringing). Not til way later, twice, after any inkling of religion was pounded out of me.

You can only deal with what I have for so long before God either becomes an enemy, or a sad fairy tale told to the foolish and naive.

And I would think that it was temporary... Except this has gone on in some form my entire life. It's unspeakable. I will never, never get justice for what has been done... I can barely speak about it in even the most general terms.

In addition to that, I am now being evaluated for an uncommon and highly stigmatized disorder.

I just want to have a normal life.

Just be able to do normal things. Get out of bed to a house that's not a pig sty, mostly thanks to chronic illness and my incredibly useless excuse for a ""partner"" who barely works rn and gets paid to stay home... but still makes no progress on the mess and won't communicate about it without becoming abusive and effectively traumatizing me into a meltdown and shutdown. 

I have no one.

I am an orphan, there is nowhere to run. I have tried.

The shelters are worse than home.

Daycare hasn’t reopened and has no plans to reopen, but is still charging $75 a week to *not* teach or watch any kids.  

Spouse isn’t going to take any time off of work to give me even a one-hour break, and is going back to the office the *second* it reopens.  “I need this,” they told me.  “It’s for my mental health.  I just can’t stay at this house any longer.”

Looking for work is still impossible because there is no one to take care of the kid, and Spouse continues to sabotage the job search.  “Of course I can watch the kid” so I can do an interview becomes “I have a meeting” ten minutes before the call is scheduled.  Actual interviews get interrupted when the router “accidentally” gets turned off mid-call.  Recruiters who went to the same schools Spouse did *somehow* stop answering their phones or emails after alumni events I know Spouse attended. I am expected to believe a toddler somehow climbed into the closet and poured paint all over my interview suits in the closet while I was at the grocery store. 

Watching the kid isn’t going to get any easier.  Months and months and months of tantrums, of failed potty training, of screaming sleepless nights, of being called too fat and stupid to parent by everyone at the pediatrician’s office, of being coughed and sneezed and pissed and shat on, of having meals I prepared rejected and thrown across the room by two stupid assholes (only one of whom has the excuse of being under three) who refuse to eat it or anything else but complain that they’re still hungry.  No daycare, no breaks.  24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

And I ever complain about this, to anyone I know?  Then they remind me that I’m the asshole for complaining.  Because I don’t have a job.  Because I’m a leech.  Because I’m a breeder.  Because I don’t have enough kids.  Because I don’t like being a parent.  Because I don’t know how easy I have it. Because they have it worse.  Because other people have it worse.  

And Spouse hears about it all, and makes sure I hear it back.

EDIT: Hey mods, why can’t I say anything in my own defense without you removing my comments?

I see the mods have removed me standing up for myself in the face of an admitted troll, so here’s my takeaway.

Just ... the sheer *gall* it takes to read about four discrete instances of Spouse sabotaging my attempts to find literally any job—to the point where they poured paint over my interview suits and blamed it on a toddler who did not have access to any paint and could not have climbed that high in the closet—and then turn around and *take Spouse’s side* and call it “tough love” and then constantly demonstrate exactly the kind of abuse I get whenever I try to open up about my life and my feelings ...

she has felt suicidal feelings for years and last night she told me she has a concrete plan to commit the deed, after she pays back some debts to me from when we were dating, and sorts out other things.  she said she still has feelings for me but does not want to try and fix things between us.

she says nothing but her brother is important to her, but that her pets and I are still more important than this other guy.

Like why tell someone they need to live when they might not.

I've never really experienced love in my life. I don't just mean romantic love but also family an friend. I've had glimpses of it but it always ended up with rejection, emotional neglect, or abuse etc. I know some of it is my fault in the last several years because I lost hope in love actually existing for someone like me and therefor I either stop trying or run away but the last couple of times I really tried my hardest to be open I just get rejected/abandoned or emotionally neglected. I can't even describe how deep the hurt is at this point but it's unbearable.   


My parents were very distant, they'd physically care for me but emotionally they were never there. The rare time they did speak to me was to say how disappointed they were, how they liked my sibling better, how I was a bad child even though I wasn't. I vividly remember cracking in the middle of the night because of bullying in school and going to my mom crying and she didn't care at all. My father has hit me, yelled in my face and just generally didn't like me because I was struggling and I'm not what they wanted. Eventually I got kicked out over nothing when I was 18. I've been estranged from my family for over a decade now, the few times I tried they took no responsibility for their actions and always blamed it on me so for my own sanity I had to remove myself from the toxicity.  


I had two close friends at different times growing up. The first ended up ditching me for new friends and the other did some horribly hurtful things, bullied me, and then ditched me for other people. I was horribly bullied in school and most of the teachers didn't care. I recently found someone I thought could be a friend but they only seem to care about themselves. The other people I met don't even care to reply to a message.   


I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety at age 16 but I remember things going as far back as I can recall. I went through years of medications and therapy with some awful doctors who didn't care or even called me weird for being different. I tried so hard to fix myself when really a lot of the damage is there because of other people.  


The people I dated ended up mostly being horrible people. I suffered extreme abuse, rape, starvation, physical violence, emotional abuse and neglect, financial abuse, isolation the whole thing. I spend several years essentially locked away and tortured at one time. I had to flee to a shelter to get out. I moved around a lot because by that point I was so unwell that there was no way for me to work and I had no help from anyone or the government so I ended up with stranger after stranger desperately trying to not become homeless. All of whom treated me horribly, even faced sexual harassment. All this is just a fraction of what I've been through but the post would get too long if I fit it all in. Either way through it all I still kept trying to keep going.  


I found out a couple years back that I actually have high functioning autism and adhd. Suddenly all my struggles were no longer because I didn't try hard enough and it made sense why I couldn't connect with people, why they'd use/abuse me, or just weren't interested. At first things started to get better because I wasn't beating myself up as much and I tried to work on things as best I could but honestly at some point it's just not enough. I can only do so much on my own.  


If your entire life you've been rejected, unwanted, unloved, neglected, and abused by literally everyone how are you supposed to constantly pull yourself back up out of impossibly hard situations and pits of despair. I'm only human, humans need love and acceptance at least to a degree to function. At some point I can't do it all on my own. I tried to love myself as much as I was able to despite everything telling me I'm worthless, I tried to be strong, I tried to better myself but I just don't see the point anymore in even trying. I've seen no results.  


All I wanted was just one person to love me truly, not for the purpose of using me, not as a second best option, not as a way to pet themselves on the back for being such a good person for helping a vulnerable person and then taking advantage of it. That's all I ever wanted, real love and respect. Something most people have in some way in their lives that I never got to experience for real.   


Videos of parents showing respect and love for their children kills me inside, seeing friends so happy with each other, seeing people in love and really be there for each other. Why am I not worthy of that? Is it because of the baggage I carry? Is it because of the autism, depression, adhd? or maybe because I'm scared to get hurt even more? It's not like I'm not trying the very hardest I can. I try to be a good person. I'm just not perfect. Other people aren't perfect either yet people don't want someone like me. They don't want the burden or challenges. Which I understand, I just wanted someone to care enough to really try despite those challenges in the same way I had to fight to even exist still.  


I've truly just given up now. I only felt like this once when I was in that particularly abusive situation. I still don't know how I stopped myself from jumping off a bridge then. I think because I still had a shred of hope that I was worthy to someone. I had to be stronger than any person should ever have to be and for what? I now feel the same way I did then. I'm done with talking about it, talking doesn't change anything and there's no action showing promise in sight. I have no motivation in changing myself any further to appeal to someone else, I'm either worth it or not and the consensus is not. I just don't have the strength left. The depth of my loneliness is staggering, the hurt from the constant rejection is mountainous. I just can't keep climbing and falling off on my own anymore. I'm done.  


Honestly, I think people would be glad to be rid of the burden I am. Maybe a couple will be sad for a minute but people will move on as they always have and I'm forgotten. At least then I no longer have to be in emotional and physical agony every second of every day for nothing. I don't even want to die, I love life for all it's beauty, I love my pets, I care so much for others, and I love so many things but loving other things just isn't enough for me anymore. I need it in return. 30+ year of suffering with no end in sight. I don't see a reason to continue.",SuicideWatch,I'm done.

I used to be smart.’I went to a smart school as an elementary schooler/middle schooler/was type a. I had big plans. I saw my plans recently and cried.

I am trapped in a relationship. I got drunk and cheated two times. Not consciously per say. He got drunk and hit me twice, one time he didn’t realize it was me and the second time he knew it was me and I hid in a closet. Both times I was scared shitless. He doesn’t believe a word I say. He did those things after I cheated so maybe my fault. I’m too much of a coward to break up with him. He’s the only one I’ve told the full extent of my conditions.

Next thing you know he got admitted, and now my sister has it.  So then my dad got better, and he came back from the hospital. However ever since he came back he’s been acting really hostile towards me. I don’t know why.

But at the end of the day my father comes up to me and calls me useless for not eating, he says I’m an annoying brat. but when I confront him about it he says ‘i Shouldnt take these things seriously‘ and proceed to ignore me.

It's no exaggeration to say I'd rather die than do this. I was so afraid of the first session I actually almost killed myself. I haven't gotten so close to it this time, but the stress of it is very clearly wearing on me. It is such an intense and scary process that it's pretty much sapping me of all my energy. Now the logical step would be to stop but the problem is I can't. The whole reason I'm doing this is to prevent suicide in the first place. I realized that if I don't confront this, it'll eventually eat away so much of me that I'll take my own life. So I'm damned if I do and damned if I don't.

It all feels so hopeless. I'm tired and afraid and I just want all of this pain to stop. I have been carrying this weight for so long. Fighting to keep myself from going insane for so long. I just want to give up. I'm so tired. I am so, so, so tired. I'm not even to my second session and already I just want to give up, as in dying give up. This torture will never end. All because of three events in my past. I've lost so many years and I feel like I'll only waste the ones remaining. Life for me is nothing but a struggle not to fall into my own despair, trying to keep my head above water. I want to give up. I want to finally stop fighting and close my eyes.

Am I normal? I don’t think I am. Whenever I’m stressed out I tend to forget to take care of myself and it bit me in the ass today. My mom asked me why I didn’t take a bath and when I told her I forgot. She started lecturing me on how that’s not normal and I started spiraling down into a breakdown. She asked if I feel icky not washing and tbh, I don’t.  Then she started talking about how I don’t cook, or baking and stuff that my brothers did when they were my age. But I can’t do those things without thinking of killing myself 

Holding a knife? How about I stab myself with it? Turning on the stove? How about I let it burn me? I would think about those kinds of stuff when things went bad. 

Then it all went downhill when she told me that teenagers aren’t supposed to cry. To me, that’s the equivalent of her invalidating my feelings. 

I made mistakes and I’m not afraid to admit it but when I’m constantly reminded of it, it just brings up my own perception of a failure.

I’ve had a tough life, and has just gotten shittier and shittier as time goes by, even though people say it gets better over time. This just isn’t the case for me. I’ve been pretty severely depressed and contemplating suicide for about 6 years now but never had the balls to do it. Except recently(past year or so) it has gotten significantly worse, everything I do and think about leads to leaving this world. 

I had a crazy ex girlfriend in the 8th grade who would basically stalk me and sometimes stalk my sibling. It got really annoying and emotionally draining because I thought the relationship would bring me happiness and cure my depression that started near 7th grade, but it really just made it worse. She knew that I struggled with mental health, but she just tormented me about it and would pretend to be depressed to me whenever she doesn’t get her way. I finally got the courage to break up with her in the 9th grade and just over a year of dating and I actually felt happy for once. Until she continued to follow me and boss me around. After about a month of her constantly harassing me, I stood up for myself and told her to leave me alone and go find someone else to bug. I really thought that I was helping myself at that moment but I just fucked myself even more, because she then cut herself on the chin with her fingernail in front of me and my friends, and then she told everyone I hit her, which really sucked because I know I didn’t hit her and my friends know I didn’t, but nobody else believed me. I was then looked at as a girl beater and a sack of shit, which I already felt like one but this just tipped it over the edge. I have received death threats to me and my family and was told to kill myself for something I didn’t do. And if anyone out there feels depressed and suicidal, the worst thing for someone to tell you is to kill yourself, when you already feel that way. The worst part about this situation is that she never had any proof whatsoever, but people still believed her because “she’s a girl” or at least that’s what they told me. I was so depressed after that, I just shut everything out and completely forgot that I could take legal actions, but I know now it’s too late for that.

I loved hockey and had a blast every time I played. This was the only thing in life that gave me peace and happiness. Hockey was my escape from my own life if that makes any sense. Until one game, a guy from my school that was friends with my ex targeted me and purposely “illegally” hit me. He was banned from the league, but it costed me a fractured knee. I was then told by a doctor that due to this injury, I couldn’t play hockey anymore. This absolutely broke me. The one thing that gave me happiness was taken away from me by some stuck up asshole who wanted me gone.

It’s now 6 years later with nonstop sadness. I was told that because I’m a man I shouldn’t show my emotions, so that’s what I did. I pushed them so far down that I was not only numb to emotions: I was numb to everything. And everything leads back to one mistake... a relationship. This one girl took my life and smashed it with only 3 words.

I’ve planned my death many times, but never followed through with it because of my family. I know my family loves me even though sometimes it doesn’t seem like it. I’m not even living for myself anymore, I’m just living for them. I’ve had a hard time focusing with my future career because all I hear in my head is “don’t worry, you won’t make it til then”, which seems true and honestly I’m hoping it’s true.

I want to die, but I also don’t want to die if that makes any sense at all. I wish there was a way to just press restart and have a chance to redo my life and fix everything. I thought death would give this to me, but I know it doesn’t work like that. I know with death you’re just gone forever and not given a chance to redo. As much as I want to restart, I know there’s no way to restart unless I finally follow through with it and see for myself.

If you took the time read all of this.
thank you.

It's nothing new to me but the past few months have resulted in a depression I've never felt before.

The ironic thing is I'm studying to be a virologist. The idea of a pandemic has been on my mind for many years, and I was educated about the possibility that this would probably happen. But I never really fully understood the mental toll that this would take. I'm a very social person, it's how I cope. I don't like to sit around or I know the thoughts will creep in. I love going to bars, seeing my friends, partying, being active, exploring new places. This has become extremely difficult, basically impossible, in the past few months.

I was also dumped about a week before quarantine started. I've had no opportunity to go and try and get over them; I've just been sitting in my room ruminating about how lonely I am and how I'm wasting away my early 20s. I wanna meet new people and be carefree like I was before. I am so fucking conflicted and upset.

I feel like a brat complaining but everything is going to shit and I can't handle it anymore. I just want to distract myself but I have no good way of doing it.

Was playing the victim because my parents died when I was 10 and 17 yo. I'm 28 now. 

That's when I became a winner. Constantly working out, eating healthy and going to the gym. Focusing on my career.

After a while I started to crash though. Became extremely neurotic. Filled with regrets. Intrusive thoughts about how I will get lung cancer soon and die. What a loser I am and so on. 

I contacted my ex in some irrational impulse and started crying to her that I'm going to die soon. She dissed me and blocked me. I made a new account and told her why I think I'll die soon and so on. She replied for a while and said I didn't change a bit. I was like 'whut? I've turned my life around and she says I didn't change' so I again made a new account. This triggered her so much and she completely destroyed me in a message. 

Next obsession was born. Her insults were so spot on and painful that I went crazy. For like 8 weeks I would constantly hear it repeat over and over again. I couldn't take it. These words will haunt me forever. After and before work I would send her a bunch of messages and delete it again. I'm constantly fighting my irrational brain that wants to contact her and talk this out so it will stop repeating, but then I think how pathetic I am to contact her. I just want these thoughts to stop repeating and I don't want to hear it on my deathbed. It's such a stain on my life. Her pure disdain. Being talked to like you're scum of the earth. She said I will never learn how to live my life and I feel like I'm destined to prove her right. Someone you used to love who confirms your nagging feeling that you're a failure. 

And now I've lost my self-respect. Constantly hearing her insults repeat made me extremely suicidal. I'm fucking embarrassed that I was contacting her so much. I'm an insane person. I'm a loser.

I have a new friend that I was just starting to get to know before the pandemic hit. She and I had been in touch regularly and then as we all started to work from home and get locked in we drifted a part. 

She reached out to me about a week ago and said she was looking for a change and thinking about moving to a new place. I didn't find this alarming at all. 

Yesterday I sent her a message to ask her how she was and she said she is bad. She was giving short responses and something about it was very alarming to me. I asked her if I could call her tomorrow and she said maybe. But then she went completely silent and stopped responding to my messages. 

I called her this morning and a few other times throughout the day and sent her several messages to ask if she is okay, and I got no responses. I don't know her well, but I know she lives alone. She works in healthcare and so I think she would likely understand my concern and send a text back to let me know she is okay. But maybe she is just embarrassed or something and is ignoring me for other reasons. 

I just don't know what to do. I don't know her address, or her last name, I only have her first name and her phone number. I don't know anyone that knows her so I don't know who to reach out to. I am in the US. 

I am worried if she is fine that I may just be really annoying her. But if she is not, what if she needs help and its not too late?

I kinda feel that I shouldn't write because some of my problems are rather frivolous. This year I'll be 27. Most of my life has been experiencing and witnessing domestic violence, and child abuse (towards me).

I cannot be bothered to have friends, and I don't want to waste peoples time. So I've pushed people online away and people in real life away (I had a couple of friends in school, they had my phone number but never contacted me anyway...)

In saying that, there's one guy I talk to online. I don't feel I'm wasting his time because he's messed up  and twisted like me. I'm attracted to him. I just wanna be in his arms but he lives in another country very far away and COVID isn't going to let anyone see each other soon :\\

I want a relationship with him again (yes we've broken up twice), yet I can't be bothered. And I'm worried that if he saw me in real life again I bet he'd just laugh at my pathetic life. 

I live with my mum, I help to take care of her. She's disabled and has a medical issue. If I don't take care of her I don't know who will. She has family in her home country... Only a couple of years ago I got us away from her abusive husband...

I'm tired of pretending to be happy every day. I'm tired of just doing stuff everyday. I have no goals, hopes or dreams (except for being in my ex's arms lol).

I'm worried that my ex will eventually grow bored of me, or get sick of me, or tired of me. I'm the most boring person ever. Why would anyone even want to talk to me?

This is another reason I don't want to have friends or get involved with people. 

I wish I was never born. I'm not even a really nice person and I've made so many mistakes. I even hurt my ex like hell but he forgave me.

Why can't I just die in my sleep or something, deep down I am only miserable anyway. I'm telling myself over and over that this life isn't for me. It doesn't appeal to me. I'm sure if I had a decent upbringing things would've been different. Not like my mum was able to do much regarding that. So not her fault.

I'm not a snowflake or anything, I'm just not like everyone else. I don't see the world like 'normal' people do.

In this case, I got a little too close to mom and my brother came in and socked me a couple of times. He was the knight in shining armor that defeated the monster.   


That was always the case with me. Any time there was an altercation, I was always the instigator. Everyone has at least one reason to hate me, even going as far back as elementary school. It was also during that time where I started comparing myself to my brother and who wouldn't? I was on the cusp of getting expelled multiple times while he was learning at a faster pace than everyone else. After that, I didn't really pay attention but according to mom, it was still there.   


I have no idea how anyone would just punch their sibling and would just go with their day. It's borderline psychotic if you ask me. But that was just what broke my mind. I've had these things billowing in my head for years. I can't stand them. Thoughts about what would happen if I told people what I was doing. I would always think about that.

We all know what's going on right now.

I have always wanted to die. I've failed a few times because I got scared, I gave some sort of hint at a crucial moment, or even that I actively sought help. I'm 20, and ever since I was in middle school, I planned to die at 17.

I have no motivation and no dreams, my dream was to die and I couldn't even do that.

I'm alive because I've basically been guilty into it, ""My parents will be sad."" ""My boyfriend doesn't want me to."" ""My stepmom also suffers from depression and loves me so much she might kill herself in response.""

I've always hated that. I have to live and breathe and suffer so that the people around me don't have to. They say suicide is selfish, but isn't them wanting me to stay alive and suffer selfish.

I've been ok lately, but with the protests going on and the violence increasing, I can't help but hate myself.

I'm too scared to protest because I'm worried by boyfriend's family will hate me. I've always hated my own skin for being the color it is. I've always wished that I was white. I myself have participated in racism against blacks, against myself. I know it all stems from self hate or whatever.

I don't care about the thousands or millions of people out theres chanting black lives matter. I want the people in power to tell me my life matters. I've blocked out police brutality in the past, I've ignored racism around me, because as a lighter skinned person who grew up around white people and who talks like a white person and who doesn't act stereotypically ""black"", I've always been more accepted. Though as a black person, I've still been the butt of many jokes.

I hate it all. I hate myself. I'm finally starting to care and it hurts and I want to drown it out and act like none of it is happening but I can't. I'm guilty of wanting to live in ignorance again and I'm guilty of contributing against the cause and I want to die.

Once I was at his birthday party he started mocking me in front of them and talk things like ""It will be a miracle if he will ever graduate"" and a lot of other things like that. Even some of his friends were shocked how is he behaving to me and tried to stop him with changing the topic. I am trying my best, but the truth is that I am really depressed and anxious for a long time. His behavior wasn't good even when I was a child and my bad memories with him from the past haunt me. He was living a very wild life before he met my mother. He always wanted a children, so he grabbed the first opportunity and married my mother a few months after he met her. He was young and stupid (now he is older and stupid). However his habits from before marriage times didn't disappear. Suddenly he had me, but he also wanted to do the same things as before (partying with his friends, drinking a lot and fucking the hoes. Sorry for that word :/). Anyway the thing is my mother developed a schizophrenia and killed herself a few years ago. Also maybe because he was such a dick to me and her in the past that her brain couldn't handle that much stress and fear that she got from him. She attempted a few suicides, before her final one in a mental health hospital. From that moment everything is even worse, because he didn't know what to do when he was suddenly alone.

""suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem"". well what if your problem is permanent?! and some of our problems are truly lifelong sources of pain and misery. sometimes, the cold, hard, shitty truth is ""suicide is a solution to a problem"". 

don't get me wrong, this existence can be fucking amazing. Life Itself is intensely, almost overwhelmingly, beautiful. but only if you get to experience it within certain, though fairly wide, parameters. 

if your mind is broken, if your body is weakened, if you're undergoing insurmountable levels of trauma... by all means let yourself be free from your suffering.

In an arguement with her sister when she asked where she was going she said I am going to die

I am so worried for my parents and relatives. I have a high risk condition so cannot travel. My dad has diabetes. But my mum doesnt want to him to travel to India because she is worried for my dad and says that as her sister and other family is there she is fine.

My mum has no sense of mental health and thinks that the depression is very little and my dad should wait for a cure for coronavirus. 

My dad has been unemployed and is currently not working and my mum has been supporting my family. I have also decided to take on some online tutoring atm and have made some adverts in to get some money to help out, and I have tried to advertise on fb but I cant afford it.

Currently my parents had a massive fight on whether to go to India or not to make sure my dad if possible can prevent anything bad from happening. I am so lost and scared. I dont know what to do. Please can someone give me any advice and which one of my parents is right and whether it is worth my dad going to India to see my grandma. 

My dad also has a sister in USA but the situation is bad atm over there and there are no direct flights available. From the UK there arent any flights available wither.

My dad said he would allow my mum to go but no one in the family likes her as her intentions are pure but the way she talks and is always incorrect and says stuff like this level of depression is not showing anything as my grandma is continuing to eat, not walking out of the house or acting psychotic. 

Apart form that suicidal comment not sure if it was joke or not but I am so worried, as I have been suicidal too and my mum doesnt seem to grasp the importance of mental health. At the same time I dont want my dad to die. 

Any advice will be greatly helpful

Tldr should my dad (has type 2 diabete) risk flying to India after the quarantine in India ends and flights return to normal to see my grandma(his mum) who is having suicidal thoughts

It's so hard. It's 10 days till my next and second therapist appointment and I don't know if I can wait so long.

I constantly get bugged on for not studying hard enough, being lazy. Well, I can't. I'm literally fainting and get suicidal thoughts with extreme anxiety whenever I study. What gets me away from that though is playing games, so others see me play games and being lazy, I see it as a medicine to help with my problems.

""Will you finish high school?"" - uhh sure? I'm not gonna drop off at all.
""I haven't spoken to you for 4 months, are you ok?"" - sure I am, just been busy
""Why won't you study?"" - I'm tired.

I feel like a idiot, a moron, a cock. I feel like someone that was born to kill themselves.

I know it might sound like I'm just lazy, but you get really tired from self harm, self hate, depression and loneliness. It really drains you more than you might think. I can barely get out of bed, even though I haven't slept. I only get out of bed because I must if I don't wanna get kicked out.

I've contemplated ending my life for years. The problem is, I know it's going to hurt many people around me. I'm looking for ways to minimize the harm caused to others. 

My parents are dead but I do have two sisters and a couple of close friends. 

My attachment style is, well, Messed Up, to say the least. Anything but secure. My self-image and identity are in no way cohesive. They're not just fractured, all they are is a pile of slivers of something that could have one day been a coherent human personality. Emotionally, I'm a child. I have BPD with vulnerable narsissistic traits. All I ever want to hear or talk about is myself. I don't genuinely care about anyone elses interests or thoughts.

I really really don't want to put them through the pain of losing someone to suicide, but I'm also not able to live for decades and decades to come (I'm 23 and physically healthy). I've been put in a terrible situation, there are no winning moves, only an impossible one and a deeply destructive, hurtful one.

What can I do? Would it hurt them less if it seemed like I died of an illness rather than suicide? I'm planning on distancing myself from everyone (so I'm not so close to them anymore) in order to make it less painful for them that way.",SuicideWatch,How to hurt others as little as possible,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/gvgask/how_to_hurt_others_as_little_as_possible/,True

I never had a single friend, not even just someone to hang out or talk to, let alone relationships. I spent my childhood suffering in silence and being beaten up and humiliated. 

I have always been shorter than my peers (i'm a male so that's problematic), and due to a certain condition i look younger than my age, so everyone treats me like a kid. That along with the fact i have always been shy and quiet made me the ultimate target for the most foul ways of harassment.

Last year was so awful i had psychotic breakdowns, i started to hallucinate and became highly paranoid. So i started coping by starving and beating myself up as a means of building enough willpower so i can go about my day and study at least.

Here is a quick backstory v

Before my dad divorced my step-mom, I lived with her an her three kids. Let me just say, those 12 years I lived with them were the worst years of my life. I was constantly verbally abused by her three kids, and even by her sometimes. They didn’t like me simply because I wasn’t their real sibling, and they even told me that. I hated myself and even more, I hated my life. I am a mixed girl, my biological mother is African American, and my father is Caucasian. I grew up in a mostly white neighborhood, and I was always picked on because of the way my hair and skin looked. I was so mad at the world, I always wondered why I was even born. My dad traveled all the time due to his job, which meant I only saw him for 4 days every 6 weeks. 

I felt as if I was alone in the world, and that nobody cared about me. Eventually, my dad finally realized that I couldn’t live there anymore after I attempted to run away from home. He divorced my step-mom in the Spring of 2018. The day I found out was probably the most exciting day of my life. Him and I moved in with my grandparents and are currently still living here almost three years later. My life has been so much better now, and I’m thankful for all of the love my family has given me. However, my anxiety and depression has recently gotten worse and I don’t know what to do. 

I have no friends at school, I sit at lunch alone most days. I’m not in school right now due to Covid-19, which I am kind of enjoying because I hate being social. I see people I thought were friends hanging out with people and never thinking to invite me anywhere. It’s always been me who reaches out, and I’m sick of it because nobody will ever do the same. I’ve been feeling very lonely nowadays and it’s really taking a toll on my mental and physical health. I’m barely eating and I feel like dying every single day. The only thing keeping me alive is the thought of leaving my dad all alone in this world. I want die, but I don’t want my loved ones to be devastated. I’m ashamed of this, but sometimes I hope to get into a car crash with my family so we can all die together. 

I have a therapist, but I’ve never told her about those thoughts yet. I’m not sure if I should because she thinks that I’m getting better. In fact, my whole family thinks I’m fine now, and that having a therapist is, “unnecessary”. Truth is, I’m not fine, I’m just really good at hiding it. I really need help, I’m afraid one day I’m just going to snap and end my life. But, I don’t really want to die, I just want to feel alright.

I feel like I've reached the point of being suicidal where I'm actually okay with it. The plans of taking my life does not scare me anymore like it used to when I was a child; I feel at ease with my choice.

I not only want to die, but I'm ""happy"" to die. I'm not in a state of emotional instability; I'm not sobbing on the floor with a bottle of pills in my hand. I'm just contently numb.

People seem to think that when someone is on the verge of taking their life that they're a mess; portrayed as literally insane, you never seem to see those who aren't like that. Who have had the intention of taking their life for so many years that the thoughts become family. 

My life is a mess but I feel quite indifferent to it. I mostly drift into the days wondering if I'm even awake; I feel like I'm dreaming, but it's time to wake up.

When I first had suicidal thoughts, they scared me. I wanted to take my life but I was too scared to go through with it because it was all so uncertain; when it started, I just wanted to be happy.

I don't want to be happy anymore. What is the point? If I am, then I'll only be worried about the inevitable fate that is my unchosen death. I've wasted my life; housebound and unable to keep a single relationship going, I just see that I've done the most in life that I can; that j want to.

I used to worry about what will happen after death, but I don't want an afterlife. I just want my promised black abyss.

I'm a control freak when it comes to myself. The idea that I can not choose my death makes me mad; taking my life is going against the natural process of life and death; it feels like taking back the control of my body that I lost with my mind. 

For as long as I can remember, my mind and body haven't corresponded. I have a body that wants to survive, being controlled by a mind that wants to die; it'd awfully chaotic. 

The only thing that excites me is swallowing enough pills to watch the body that has tortured me for so long shut down. I feel disconnected from it, as if it is an enemy that just be destroyed.  

I'm okay with losing this war, I'm okay with admitting defeat; I'm okay with being suicidal.

I'm okay, yet I know I'll never be ""okay"", and I'm okay with that too.

My parents are selling my childhood house, they’ve already moved out. It’s empty. I figure I can do it there, and if I call the cops before I do it and let them know to send a clean up crew then no one will end up having to find me or deal with it. I doubt anyone would care enough to identify my body at this point anyway, so that’s not even gonna be a problem.

540,mrtokeydragon,t2_6fe4usmn,1590960750,gu7gaw,1,/r/SuicideWatch/comments/gu7gaw/feeling_odd/,3,"So I have this necklace I made, it has a quote from my fav poem.  The poem baslicly says you don't need to kill yourself today, just try, see what happens, you can always kill yourself later.  I made the necklace perhaps 8 years ago in a bhc.  I'm 35 and I struggled with depression, anxiety, so ect ect since at least the 5th grade.

Anyways I just feel odd... Oh yeah that necklace broke yesterday.  So it broke yesterday and yesterday I had a nice day.  But over all I have been slipping back into depression and haven't been taking my medication or going to appts.  I kinda have kinda given up the last few years, can't bring myself to work anymore...  Wait what am I doing, I didn't mean to tell you my history.

Anyways.  The necklace broke and I really liked it but things come and go and it's not what upset me.  If anything I appreciate that I liked it and it's time had come.  

But what makes me feel odd is my current level of safty, how I would probably agree to death at this moment, mixed with the unavailablity of a bch to feel safer as well as the necklace that reminded me to die another day not today, died that day.  Almost as if it were a sign or a stopwatch and perhaps that later day is today...  

I have been passively planning on not living in the future.  I don't care for possessions or money.  I mostly spend on food or other consumable things.  But I didn't plan on leaving now, but it makes me think why not now.  What more would even come...  Nothing new and nothing good has happened lately, if anything it is as always, consistently getting slightly worse...  

I'm not in danger atm, I just feel really odd.  As if death actually showed up and said that he is here to forfill my wish but now I don't wanna go, and he asks why and I don't know...  I just feel hopelessly odd atm about living, just like I felt hopelessly alone when I was a young virgin...  Perhaps I'll always live this story just with different names and places...  Perhaps life will get a tad better at some point.  But even if it doesnt, I had some deeply loving relationships (in my ruminating daydreams) and those feelings are something I will always treasure and hopefully I'll someday learn to forgive others for expecting perfection from me but give me less than minimum when talking about the deep feelings of love and validation I once got from my ruminations.  

And even if I don't, I ask that if you need to daydream about me.  I'd love to do anything to make you happy.  I just wish we as people would actually care that deeply for one another, but it always seems to be some bastardization of that...  But it's ok.  I love you even tho I will never know you.

Edit: if anyone is interested here is the poem

""To the Young Who Want to Die,"" by Gwendolyn Brooks

Sit down. Inhale. Exhale.
The gun will wait. The lake will wait.
The tall gall in the small seductive vial
will wait will wait:
will wait a week: will wait through April.
You do not have to die this certain day.
Death will abide, will pamper your postponement.
I assure you death will wait. Death has
a lot of time. Death can
attend to you tomorrow. Or next week. Death is
just down the street; is most obliging neighbor;
can meet you any moment.

You need not die today.
Stay here--through pout or pain or peskyness.
Stay here. See what the news is going to be tomorrow.

""But you don't know for sure it won't get better!""

Nothing has worked. I'm still a fucking mess. I've done so many different treatments that were 'perfect for my issues' and they. didn't. work.
I'm not stupid. I'm not delusional. 
Looking at it rationally I am way more likely to keep living like a mess. So what it the issue? Just so I can fuck up 10 more years and still end up killing myself? Hurting everyone around me in the mean time? HOW is that the better option? How is me killing myself and getting rid of the problem not the best possible option? I know I've tricked people into loving me and they will be hurt. But me being alive is so much worse for them. 

Staying alive just means more pain. Staying alive just means more problems. Staying alive just means ruining more lives. The magical possibility of things going better is not worth all of that.

People who have the possibility to maybe possible live get their plugged pulled all the time. What so different with my situation? You look at all the options, pros and cons and make the hard decision.

I should mention it is a large property in a desolate area with two other homes on the property. My home being the least desirable, it was owned by my family and when my father died it went into a trust with his four siblings and my mother. Things are very ugly with my family, I took care of my dad for four years helping my mom, with the rest of the family doing jack shit. That's all fluff but what remains the same is I am losing the only place I've called home in my adult life during a pandemic with a two-week notice. The owner some techie who struck rich by making an algorithm is buying my home just to tear it down, I asked him to at least give me 30 days just so I can move out properly, but that's not happening. 

I have sacrificed a lot to be here, I have a community here, I worked with my neighbors, fixed one of their sinks, one had a stemi and I helped save his life, my other neighbors are drinking buddies, I will never have what I am losing. 

I'm a paramedic, I cannot tell you how much I hate my job, I work per diem due to this whole COVID-19 thing I can't get enough shifts to pick up work, I'm not getting the money I usually am let alone the 600 a week like everyone else. I've worked just over 2 years as a medic and I've had 2 Pedi-codes and a non-viable traumatic birth, all of which haunt me in my sleep plus much more. I had an injury off the clock that took 8k out of my savings and took me out of work for a year. The entire ""Hazard"" pay is getting the shaft, who knew that private EMS would not care for their employees during a god damned pandemic. I cannot stress to you how much I hate my job, I'd be better off if I just got laid off. 

I can't find a place to live, I refuse to move back in with my mom who lives in a senior living community in the middle of nowhere in a trailer. I'm panic attack where my chest hurts, I see different colors, and can feel my pulse in every inch of my body, I feel like when I'm having one of these I am going to die. I can't pack my bags, or anything. 

I haven't received a final notice of when to get out but my guess is the 15th if I'm lucky. I can't find a home in a market this saturated, during a pandemic, and when I'm flat fucking broke. I can't afford the first-month last month. I was actually planning on buying my shitty little house to raise a family in.

Things aren't worth living for with this place, they for sure won't be without it. I will never have a place like this again, some of the only memories I have of my dad are going to be bulldozed in a few weeks. 

I can't see my therapist due to the social distancing thing, and every time I talk to her on the phone she begins crying. I really can't think of myself being alive in two weeks.

I've battled anxiety and depression for nearly 20 years (female turning 30 and the first thought i had of suicide was when i was 10). I've gone through programs, medication, hospitalization, diet/exercise improvements, the whole shebang several times. I'm at a decent point in my life and have friends around and a partner who cares about me but for the last few days my anxiety has tipped to a breaking point and I am not okay.

Overcoming social anxiety has been my greatest struggle and the last few days I have been put to the test so goddamn hard. So many impromptu gatherings from my partner's family (I no longer speak to my own they are abusive) and I am just completely out of spoons. Social interaction takes a fuckton out of me but I haven't had a choice lately. I've been fighting back panic attacks every second for the last 4 days at least. Today I couldn't do it anymore. I've been crying and shaking and I couldn't get my ""game face"" on. I straight up told my partner I am having a really hard day because my anxiety has hit a breaking point. I couldn't get myself together to watch my stepdaughter so he had to take her out with him. He tries to understand but he is also out of spoons for his own reasons, and today told me my anxiety is ""the stupidest fucking thing ever and i don't understand why you can't just not have anxiety.""

When they came back, he threw something at me that i wasn't prepared for. It was a plan to get something done today that we had discussed earlier in the week but in my days-long anxious state, I had forgotten and he just SCREAMED. Told me to act like a fucking adult and handle my shit because ""that's what we're all doing."" I understand that's what we're all doing, and it is absolutely my fault that I forgot, but all I've wanted for the past 4 days is some fucking compassion from my partner about my mental health because I CANNOT FUCKING EXIST AND TAKE CARE OF MYSELF WHEN EVERY DAY IS SUDDEN SOCIAL FAMILY PARTY INTERACTION and he's an extrovert and doesn't get that I guess, i don't know.

We've been through so much but I can't seem to get him to understand that yelling at me WHILE I'M HAVING A PANIC ATTACK is not helpful at all, and now i'm wondering if my mental illness is just too much for anyone to love me and I just want to die. I don't know how to live in this world.

And I feel selfish for losing control of my mental illness because of all the fucked up shit going on in the world right now, but I need at least one person to tell me that I should keep trying because I can't keep up with these panic attacks anymore, I don't know how to keep a brave face on anymore, I don't know where to get help anymore, I'm just sobbing as a write this and I'm sorry it was so long but I need help.",SuicideWatch,I need help now,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/gtle5m/i_need_help_now/,True

Don't try to spill any bullshit about ""you can live without others"" because you can't. Even if you try to go about your own life, it's not as if we live within a vacuum, void of other human life. If you do nothing, someone will judge you and therefore treat you differently. If you do something, the same thing happens.

I've learned to live with people I don't care about forming judgement about me. However, I do care about what people I enjoy think about me. Still, there's never a way to please anyone.

You do one thing. It's too much, and it's too little. You do another thing. You did it wrong, or it was right but not enough or way too much. You make a compromise. Eventually, the other party keeps pushing it their way, and when you finally take a step up and speak out, it's too late and they've gotten accustomed to it and you're the one with attitude.

It's the little comments, the ones that aren't targetted, that push me over the edge. Initially, you were hesitant to do the challenge, but one friend had challenged you. You check to see how many other people are doing it, there are a lot. You decide to do it. You do the bare minimum, it's done. Later that day, you see a general post by a different friend calling ""'doing xxx' is a plague"". They say it's hypocritical and that people who do it are insincere. You know that it wasn't directed towards you, but towards a trend that you have participated in, but the judgement is still there. It stings, and you later delete the post of what challenge you had done. You're tired.

It's the ignoring of your words. You have begged to quit an activity for 2 years after your mother forced you to change teachers without asking you first, and this is the first time you've despised a teacher. You make an agreement, ""five lessons"". Five lessons are over, you ask to quit. They ask ""five more"". This continues, and eventually, ""fives lessons"" becomes ""until xxx event one year into the future is done, then you can quit"". You've done the event. It's been 2 months, you're still doing the activity. You've had enough, and lash out, demanding to quit. Suddenly the deadline is extended ""til the end of summer"". When will enough be enough? You demand to stop. They don't listen. You're the troublesome child, and they're sick of your 'disobedience'.

Four years ago, you had moved. New place, new friends, and it was fine. You were just a little sad, but that was to be expected. You daydreamed about plans you and your childhood friends had made about the future together, knowing they won't be happening anymore. It was fine, sadness was normal. But it didn't get better. It got worse.

You started noticing all the flaws about yourself. You're overtalkative, your friends make harmless jokes that you're annoying. You laugh it off, you know they don't mean it and that they enjoy your company, but even if they don't mean it, they still thought it. It's still true.

You're second choice. Constantly. One time you ask a friend if they'd be willing to go to an event with you. You explain, you really want to go, but you don't want to go alone, and being there together would be fun. They say no, they don't want to, and you're sad, but you let it go. The event draws closer, you ask one more time, they still say no. Later, it's the day of the event. You're at home, doing work, because you didn't go because your friends weren't planning on going. You see a post online, and it's your friend you had asked. They are at the event with a few of your other friends. You ask about this later, she tells you that she changed her mind last minute because one of the other friends had begged and pleaded. You wonder if she would've done the same for you, or if it was because you weren't as close.

The years continue, you still nitpick at yourself. It gets bad two years after, you start bruising yourself to feel something, or anything. No one notices, but one person. The person asks you how you got that bruise, and you laugh it off, saying it was from being clumsy. They laugh too, and the event is over. You scratch your arms. You dig your blunt nails into your skin. You force yourself to throw up in the toilet sometimes. You stop eating as much at lunch. You wonder if you have depression. 

You daydream about dying, you look up the methods. Still, you don't do anything beyond that. Nothing permanent, no scars. You just want to feel something, and this is how you do so.

Things get better. You feel better. You stop the bad habits.

A peer dies at school. Official cause is listed as an accident ( a car hit him, a pedestrian ). Rumors at school say it was suicide. He was a friend of your friends, and they're upset. You didn't really know him, but you start thinking a lot. School moves on quickly, his death is forgotten. You know that if it was you, you would be forgotten too.

Things get worse. You feel worse. The daydreams begin again. During cross country, you're a little too close to the road center. You feel the breeze of the car as it races by. It's exhilarating, and you wonder how it would be if you were even closer.

You go biking with friends. You're a bit more careless.

Eventually, things get better. You're happier, and you laugh about every considering the notion that you were ever depressed. Afterall, other people have it worse, and you're genuinely happy. You stop the habits. The daydreams go away.

Eventually, things get worse. The daydreams return.

It's a cycle.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think I've ever wanted to die as much in my life as much as I do right now. Still, in the end, I still am consumed by other people's opinions of myself. I've got a plan now. I'll wait it out, see how I feel. Maybe things will be better when the future is more complete. I'm not depressed, nor suicidal, let me tell you that. I've had a great life. I'm lucky to have been born in great circumstances, have a loving family, and friends who care. I don't know why I hate myself and my life so much. I don't want to express my real feelings to anyone, because I know it will hurt them so much. I'm trying my best, and I'm really tired. I'm just tired.

It's not that I want to die, it's just that I'm sick of myself and my life. If things get better, I really hope that I don't feel this way in one year, but if I do? Then I do. 

&amp;#x200B;

You've got a plan. In about one year, you'll make your decision. You don't want to do it too early, as to hurt your loved ones. You know they still care. So, you'll wait it out, and see if things get better, and then choose not to do it.

You've got a plan. It'll make it seem like an accident. Hopefully. It will still hurt your friends and family, but it's more of a closure then them knowing you did it on purpose. A car accident is easy. You just hope it's enough to actually kill you, if you decide to go through with it. If it doesn't work? Too bad. I guess carbon monoxide would be much less painful, and you can blame the desire on the accident. It will hurt them, but guess what?

I’m coming up on some trauma anniversaries and between that and the fact that I’ve been isolating alone for 3 months I’m spiraling. The past 3 days I’ve spent over 20 hours researching suicide methods and imagining how I’d do it. I’ve been thinking a lot about getting my affairs in order and writing notes. I’ve been trying to utilize everything I’ve learned in therapy to help myself out of this spiral but the more I think about it the more hopeless I feel.

I’m having a moment of lucidity. I think I need to get help. What do I do? I almost went to the hospital last night but there has to be a better option. I’m very broke right now but my mom has good insurance that I can use. I don’t know where I should go. I don’t know if I should check myself into a psychiatric facility or even how to find one. I don’t have a therapist or psychiatrist and I don’t want to wait months to see one. 

My mom lives out of state. Do I call her or should I call a local friend? I don’t know what to do. I don’t think I’ll be okay if it’s just me alone in my apartment. I have some amazing local friends who have been so good about checking in with me lately. I wish I could call them and ask to stay with someone but I don’t want to ask anyone to break social distancing for me. Would it be wrong to ask for a friend to pick me up so I know I’ll be safe? I think I’m having some kind of breakdown. 

I have work I need to do for clients today and I feel so guilty because I don’t want to take their money and disappear. I keep saying I’ll finish up the work I need to do then figure out if I should go to a hospital but I don’t know if I can handle it.

I can't manage to go through all the stuff that's wrong with me and what's going on, it would be a book. I just need some form of support. I keep getting very suicidal as soon as I'm left alone, and I'm not sure how long I can keep fighting this. Been severely depressed for 8 months (and mildly/moderately depressed for a few months prior to that). My normal state is mild depression, I am rarely ""normal mood"". I've been suicidal for the last 4 months or so.  
Loneliness is killing me. I have people in other countries, but for reasons I don't want to go into, I am stuck in one that I hate (not virus related). I only have my kid here and when they are not at home I fall apart because I can only manage to keep it together when they are home, for them. I have amazing friends and an even more amazing boyfriend, but all in other countries, and I cannot see them. It's been nearly 4 months since I saw my bf, and I miss him a lot.   


I feel like I just want to die because it hurts too much, and there is no way out of this alive, as far as I can see. I have loads of pills and alcohol that would highly likely work if I were to take them. I did do an OD in my teens many years ago, but told someone as I changed my mind. Nearly fell in a coma, but was rushed to hospital and they sorted me out. I know I am capable of it, but likewise I don't actually want to die, I just want things to be better. I cannot see a way to get better, or get my life into a place where it's liveable for me. I am doing everything I can, but not really getting anywhere. 

I don't really know what I'm asking for. I feel I can't open up to bf/friends/family as I don't want anyone to feel responsible if I were to off myself, and there is nothing they can do anyway since they are all so far away. I am scared to reach out to helplines or doctors here due to the fact I have a kid and they would not approve. It is a consequence that would make things a lot worse than they already are.

I live in the United States and while I am not wealthy, I do live comfortably enough to have my own PC, go to college, and a part time job. I live with my single mother and a cousin.

I have not been diagnosed with any mental disorders but I also have never talked to a therapist or psychiatrist about my problems. For the last year and a half I have been suicidal and I also believe that I am depressed or have some sort of anxiety disorder.

I have only told a small amount of people that I was suicidal, but I haven't told any of them how badly it still effects me today and I am sure that since it was so long ago that many probably don't think I am suicidal anymore.

I would like to preface this next part saying that my mom is wonderful but at the same time I don't think she really gets my problems at all, (definitely my own fault). I have tried to talk to her about these issues but I get scared and have only been able to vaguely bring up that I would like to seek help. I told her I just thought I had anxiety issues because if I were to explain why I am suicidal I think she might hate me.

This leads me finally to why I am considering suicide. As many times as you may have heard this before, I HATE myself. Like I never understood self hatred until I experienced it myself. I constantly reflect on my actions and utterly hate myself as a human. I often lie to people I care about and act in ways that others find annoying or obnoxious. I have slowly over the last few years lost most of my friends to nothing but them not really liking me as a person. I have perpetually been the extra kid in the group that eventually is ghosted as people often get tired of me quickly and move on.

Onto my college life... After having two classes with bad grades in the last year, I now am just under the minimum threshold for the program i was hoping to apply to in the Fall. I had really solid grades at the school I went to previously but at my school they look only at the GPA you have from classes on their campus rather than all of your classes. I am now likely not getting in because of those two classes, and once that is confirmed as being the case I do not think I will be able to handle it. It will likely force me to either admit to my mother and family that my grades have been bad lately and I am not the smart and intelligent student they have imagined  me to be. My mom has a genuine blind trust in me that I use against her so much that it makes me sick to think about. My mom will then realize I have been lying to her about my grades and I do not think I can handle that. Just thinking about what might be the outcome if it came to that terrifies me and I genuinely feel like this is going to be the last straw. I feel like I am being slowly backed into a corner by my own selfish actions and I believe that it would be better for everyone if I was gone rather than making a scene for my family. If I end my life here they can chalk it up to mental illness and maybe they won't find out the real shitty person that I am.

I so desperately want to say that what others think about me doesn't matter but it does. It matters so much that it practically dictates my life now. This may seem over dramatic but this is because I once again cannot get myself to talk about the worse of my faults. I would be too embarrassed to share even on an alt account which is so stupid to say out loud because I know they are probably not that embarrassing, but the idea of sharing that stuff is scary as hell to me.

At the same time I dont want to die. I really dont. I want to live and be a good person. But at this point I want to die more than I want to be alive and I do not know how much longer I can hold onto my life. I have no faith in myself to do anything so how can I expect myself to make it thru this? I hope in a year I can reflect back on how I somehow made it through what has been the worst year of my life so far, but I feel like I might not be alive by the end of the summer.

I have the idea only adults are posting in this sub, so I have the idea only adults are the ones that sometimes really do have depression. I know others of my age sometimes say something like they want to die, but I have the idea they are just saying shit because they don’t seem really depressed. So my point is.. is something wrong with me? 

When you read this you probably think like *contact an adult* or something, but I don’t see the point of that. School will still stay boring, I’ll still be useless and life will still be pointless. 

I also don’t want to hurt my family’s feelings if I really do commit suicide, but I also don’t want to move on like this. I live in the Netherlands and I have a course on school that’s called VWO (the highest and most difficult course). School gives me way to much stress because of all that homework and stuff. My family, primary school friends and teachers all told me stuff like you’re so smart and stuff, but I don’t see the point of using that. Sometimes I just wish I was more ”normal” and had less stress about school.

I don’t know if I’m just feeling down or have severe depression. I don’t know what I should do.

I can’t do this anymore. The world has gone to shit. My life is a mess. I can’t keep going anymore. 

I have no career prospects. No skills. No savings. No real home. No hobbies. No friends. There’s nothing to do and nothing to live for anymore in my life. Nothing to plan or to hope for. I’m not going anywhere and I’m sick of pretending that one day, somehow my hard work will pay off, because it never does and it never will. Fuck it all. 

My partner is a fucking nightmare to be with and is totally self absorbed and unsupportive. And swings wildly between a neurotic stoner who looses it like a skittish racehorse incapable of negating basic daily life or totally callous and cold and removed. No in between. She completely sabotages EVERYTHING I try to do for myself because she’s to fucking lazy and content with living like shit to make a change in her own life and ruins any resemblance of order I try to make for myself. 

I hate my shitty life. I hate the cunts I have to sit on the phone and “play nice with” selling shit they don’t need all day while being screamed at day in day out for less than minimum wage. I am rejected from every “good” job filtered and processed by AI I and pretend I want just so I can have a basic rate of pay that is financially viable enough to live off or god forbid, save. I looked at my CV the other day and I might as well have said, “fuck me up the arse for money” and I would have had better offers. At least then I wouldn’t feel so bad when inevitable some faceless corporation comes to emotionally, physically and financially fist fuck me in the name of profit margins and wildly conflicting agendas. At least I wouldn’t be so fucking surprised.

Everyday of my life is just one big joke. I put one foot forward and it’s just straight into the next biggest pile of dog shit. Constantly wading through piles of the next worst day of my life to the next. Pretending like one day it will be better but one day never comes.

I’m ugly, I’m fat and unemployable and scratch a bare minimum of making do throughout it all. Everything I love fucks up in the end and I hate where it’s gotten me. The vapid swirling vortex of fuck all. The purgatory of wearing this fucking mask, pushing boulders, breaking my back, tearing my nerves to shreds by the handful. Grating my bones to brittle twigs for some fat lazy cunt to get rich off of who doesn’t even know I’m alive. 

Then there’s the fucking world going to fuckkery... Honestly tell me what the point would even be anymore if I carried on and if by some miracle should somehow be falling out of my ass, why bother? Pretty much everyone is dying of this fucking virus or moronically trying to spread it further with their woowoo fucking cunt faced conspiracy shit or out of sheer ignorance desperate to give one another a death sentence via coughing fit. Even if that should somehow be solved within the next 6-8 months, the worlds still fucked and passed the point of no return, waiting for the seas to boil the life out of them, the ice caps to melt, the animals to rot from inside out and the world to goatse itself into a complete inhospitable prolapsed wasteland or, at best to wander around crippled by its change and ravage with mask and life support donned, picking our way through the mess for scraps.

Fuck me, even if the world doesn’t fuck us up, the socio-economic buggery will be the equivalent of throwing a brick into the middle of a crowded bar fight. Police and totalitarianism on the horizon, double speak, riots, food shortages, poverty, fake news, social unrest, the slump of everyday life as we know it cracking its skull on the wall behind and dribbling from its mouth as it sinks to its fucking knees.

I don’t even feel good about having kids anymore... What’s the point? Their lives will probably be worse off than my own. Maybe they too will bemoan and rue my “millennial” generation for their selfish, narsasstic, self-titled “irony”. Maybe they’ll find it in their hearts to forgive a generation of people who’s entire golden existence gave them the gift of the word “selfie” and social media that harvests their data for shady governments. Maybe they can overlook the fact that I cant afford to send them to school or home them in a house and feed them because I simply can’t make enough. 

What will I tell them when the end finally comes and they ask me “What did you do to stop all of this?”... What will I say, “oh yes darling I know we now live in a filthy pile of rags under a bin in a environmental nightmare but we had banksy make up a load of pithy little tee shirts to raise awareness and subtly undermine the futility of the modern world. Isn’t that great?!” And then we can all die from a poison gas cloud melting our lungs into grape jelly.

So what’s the point? 

Honestly? Can anyone give me a fucking reason because at this point, I KNOW it doesn’t get better or easier. I KNOW that my life will just be one lurch of shit to another. I KNOW that none of this can get any better for me, I’m ready to quit. 

I have some beta blockers and a beer, I don’t want to sit around and wait anymore. 

I can’t do this. I can’t hold on. I can’t make it better. It just doesn’t go that way for me and I hate it. I don’t want to suffer anymore and be stuck poor and making do anymore. I can’t. Everyday I am stuck inside and just waiting for the courage to not be a pussy and eat all the meds I have.

I have suffered and struggled with depression and anxiety for years over several periods in response to various issues and events. I came very close to taking my own life a few years ago but something turned me around, and I was able to see that my situation and the associated feelings may pass. And they did. I have even been able to talk openly with my family about my feelings relating to suicide, and I was able to tell them that in the event of any future episodes of loss of hope, I might just be able to stay positive, and only a major physical ailment would cause me to consider ending my life.

And sadly, thats where I am now. For reasons which cannot be ascertained, my face is becoming deformed. I suffered a minor disorder in my teens which left me with a mild asymmetry. It was able to be partially resolved with a couple of surgeries, and my life went pretty well. Not perfect by any means, but I was happy to be alive, and I know that made me lucky. My asymmetry didn't hold me back and I think that as I grew into my face it was barely noticeable. A couple of people had mentioned it over the years in an attempt to hurt me, but the fact that they would use something like that against me meant that they weren't the kind of people who held opinions that I valued. It seemed like a weak, cheap insult and made me feel more sorry for them than for me. 

Since last year something started happening to my face. First the changes were small. I could only feel them while washing my face in the shower. Nothing was visible. But following an incredible burst of growth and change in the last three or four months I am left with a huge asymmetry affecting the upper part of my face and my skull in general - in particular one of my eyes and the surrounding area. I don’t want to give details, but one side of my face and head is ballooning out in all directions. Everything is becoming crooked and twisted and as much as I wish this was in my imagination, it isn't. My concerns have been validated by medics and close family.

A scan has shown no reason for it. The symptoms and progression don’t match any of the obvious conditions which could lead to this. In fact, due to the fact that this could be seen as a reoccurrence of an earlier, long dormant issue, there is speculation that ""this could just be the way you are"". Covid means that because this isn't a malignant issue such as cancer, there's no other diagnostic route to take at the moment. But I have already run out of time. This needed to be stopped three months ago. 

The speed of progression from what I considered to be normal to where I am now has been horrific. Just a few months ago my face was mine, and it wasn't perfect but I loved it. Since then each day has brought incredible physical and emotional pain, and alongside that pain has come growth which has elongated the bones and pushed my face into a place that it shouldn't be. It has also affected my jaw severely and the function is becoming increasingly compromised. 

I have lost count of the number of photos and videos which I took to mark the progression. But I can scan through them randomly and pick out exactly when they were taken just by the shape of my face, and the extent of the disfigurement. 

My feelings started with ""maybe I am imagining this"", moved to ""well, this is happening but maybe it will stop or a cause will be found"", and I am currently at “this is inconceivable. Nobody can help me, and at this rate within two months I will be blind and unable to leave the house"". 

I am already at a point where I consider the level of disfigurement to be beyond what I can cope with. It has reached the stage where people will notice even if they aren't directly interacting with me. I am in a state of complete despair. Where I was able to see hope in the past, I see only the potential for more upset, more pain, and further loss of function. The magnitude and location of the issue means that it cannot be corrected. So each night I go to sleep knowing that today was the best I will ever look, and tomorrow will be a little worse.

The pain is almost constant. Pain itself can be alleviated a little by medication. But I know that the pain over the last few months has signified new growth, so it is reasonable to assume that continued pain means that its still happening. The fear that this brings me is indescribable. 

The time for looking at carefully angled photos and videos ended a week ago and my mind is beginning to adapt in a rather matter-of-fact way to the reality that I will spend the rest of my life in torment and pain, and the only thing which I have control over is what ""the rest of my life"" really means.

I have had tearful conversations with my mother and my sister to explain to them that I will be ending my life, and that the time will be soon. They are of course devastated. I had agreed with my mother that any final plans would be deferred until after the results of the scan, and she was right to force me to do so. I guess there was a chance that a cause may have been found for my condition. Even if the cause had itself been horrific, at least I could have blamed something for my condition. As it stands I have no idea whats happening to me. I think my mother and sister shared my hope that a cause and maybe a solution would be found. My mother says she understands my wish to end my life. We will see whether that is really the case. My sister does not. And I respect her for that. 

The absence of a root cause is bewildering, and the speed at which the changes are occurring is like nothing else I can find described anywhere online. The fact that this is happening during the isolation imposed by the Covid situation, at a time in my life where a lot of positive career and personal changes were just around the corner, and that this involves what has always been my greatest fear - facial disfigurement - makes me feel like I am in a nightmare designed especially for me.

I have told a few friends and colleagues that I have some issues with my jaw and some associated problems with my face. But thats all. I haven’t seen them due to the Covid lockdown, and working from home means I have been relatively isolated from everyone that knows me. If this affected any other part of me then I would tell them everything. And I know that if this was anywhere else on my body then I would be able to deal with it. But because it affects my face I feel a great deal of shame and embarrassment. 

My emotions about death are so confusing to me, but I can just about rationalise them. I feel justified that I will end my life, but at the same time I’m so sad that this is how things will end for me. Of all of the ways that my story could have gone this was one of the most unlikely and upsetting outcomes that I could have imagined. I have loved my life, and I wish that it could go on for a bit longer. I didn't know that I was going to have so little time. Even just another few months without this burden would bring me so much joy. 

I know that other people go through and live through so much worse. But I have reached the hard limit that I defined so clearly in my head a long time ago, and I just don't have the strength to get through this. What was a hypothetical worst case scenario has become real, and that reality is much worse than I could have imagined. 

I can’t even watch TV without feeling hurt. Everyone that I see on screen feels me with jealousy and sadness, because they are “normal”. They probably take it for granted, and that’s understandable. My previous experiences with being facially different meant that I never took it for granted. I always felt lucky for what I had. I wasn’t good looking, but I was really close to normal after my surgeries, and that counted for so much considering how I felt when I went through my earlier issues. If I watch a show or a movie that I have seen before, I remember that I was normal the last time I saw it. If I even reminisce about a happier time of my life it always ends up with me thinking about how normal i was back then. My situation is inescapable and thoughts of it consume every waking moment of my existence. 

So now I am faced with the harsh realities of finalising my last weeks or months. Closing down my affairs and finances, and performing the real life equivalent of deleting my internet history. 

At this exact moment I am a coward, and the prospect of actually killing myself fills me with fear. I live in a nation where firearms are rare, assisted suicide is illegal, and the availability of drugs which are useful in suicide is strictly controlled. Any overdose attempt now would be speculative and far from guaranteed. But I feel that the coming weeks will resolve these issues. Each day I feel a greater need to die, and as my pain and discomfort increases then so will the strength of my medications. Once I get hold of the powerful stuff then that will be my prompt to act. This will be much later than I would have hoped, as the desired time has already passed. But other methods of ending my life would be much more unpleasant, and my key concern is that I cause the minimum of distress to others. I know that the act itself will cause pain to so many people, but I hope that in time they will understand why I chose to die. 

I’m sorry for such a long post. Writing it has brought me immeasurable sadness, but at the same time it has aligned a lot of my thoughts. These aren’t feelings which I can share with anyone close to me, but I just wanted someone to know how I am feeling, even if I’m just an anonymous throwaway account on Reddit.

Whenever i think about this, i feel a sense of calm, finally a place i can rest and all my problems will be gone. Imagine it like you’re driving a car, and the car keep getting faster and faster and you want it to slow down but you don’t know how. You only know that suicide is the break, a pedal that u can press but you car will stop forever. 

I think about what happens after i die, my body, atoms, will return back to nature. The universe will continue normally just like before i was born. I know it’s wrong but in a way i look at suicide as a beautiful thing. Someone, who has been suffering, freed from their pain, resting in peace. 

It feels calm as i stand at the roof. But at the same time i’m too scared to go nearer to the edge. I’m afraid i might actually do it and jump. It tells me that deep down, i know i want to live. As i have these thoughts, i can’t help but feel selfish. I ask myself, “well if you’re so suicidal why don’t you commit suicide now? Don’t undermine the people who actually committed suicide, you didn’t suffer as much as them. You would be so selfish if you committed suicide. You will burden your family and friends with the pain”

Life is beautiful. It’s not just about constantly being happy. The pain, the hardships and not knowing everything is what makes life special. The mystery is beautiful. We fail and we fail but we have hope, goals that we want to achieve and we continue to try no matter how hard it gets. We have faith.

so, i have several chronic illnesses/diseases, as well as severe mental health problems. i am in constant pain every day, both mentally and physically, and many people just assume i'm lying. although my conditions may be rare, they are all diagnosed and recognised by doctors, and they are very real.

i have no way of communicating how much i am suffering. and even when i do, all of the doctors and therapists just say there's nothing they can do.  apparently my constant aching and fatigue is 'incurable', and i'm 'mentally-resistant' to all medications and therapies for my mind, whatever the fuck that means.

if there's nothing nobody can do, what is meant to bhappen? am i just going to have to sit here and wait until this thing kills me? because i'd rather die in peace and when i want, then let some agonising disease do it for me.

my life is awful outside of my mental and physical health too. i am surrpunded by mentally and emotionally abuse people. i am constantly manipulated, degraded and ignored because they know my brain can't stop them. i've tried to reach out for help - i've called crisis lines, even the police. do you know what they did? said i was fucking lying.

i have seen shit that nobody should ever see, let alone a fucking child. 

if i were to 'save' myself, i don't know how i'd do it. a lot of people say that overdoses are a shitty way to go, but that's because they don't know how to do it properly. i do, which is why i'm just waiting for the drugs to come my way. hanging seems unreliable, i've tried slitting my wrists before, and i don't think i have the chemicals handy to kill myself that way either.

when pets are gravely sick, what do you do? do you let them suffer, watch them live their lives in pain because of your own selfishness? no, of course you wouldn't do that. you may love them, but you don't want them to suffer. **why is my situation any different? nobody wants to hear it, but it's true: it isn't.** 

god, i wish euthanasia was legal in the UK.

i can't continue like this. stop telling me i'll get out of this situation, because i fucking wont. **i can't.** you need to understand that. 

i will always be sick.

i will always be in pain.

i will never be able to function properly.

i will never be able to *think properly.*  
so please, please stop telling me that suicide isnt an option. stop telling me it will get better. 

i want to be free from this pain. do i deserve this?

My family have told me that they forsee me being a lonely old man with cats, due to my severely unattractive face. The best I could hope for is an undesirable girl who only dates me because she is lonely, not because she appreciates me.

I go on tinder and get zero matches. No matches at all in the two years that I had the app. That means every girl who saw my profile deemed me too ugly for even a conversation. How ridiculous is that haha.

Girls frequently hit on and sleep with my friends, after they have mocked me for my undesirable looks. My ex who was unattractive and desperate set a ground rule of no sex because she openly said ""I have zero attraction to how you look"".

I have compassion for myself. Which is why I plan to end my life, because I dont deserve to live my entire life completely alone. I am a good person with unfortunate looks, thats it. I am saving myself from hell by killing myself

Them being way older they are often at different stage of their life and I was mainly alone. Looked after by a very very loving grandma. My aunt and uncle took care of me growing up. Wasn’t always close to my aunt, family fights and I’m always against my aunt. Just some adolescence stuff. Fast forward I met my first real girlfriend. L, she was kind and sweet. Purest of heart, but I ruined her, you see I had issues I didn’t know/acknowledged. Anger issues, possessiveness and even a lil bipolar. She was in an abusive relationship with me. She was my pillar for my uncle’s passing. Uncle was a father figure for me. A very close man that I truly admired. Died due to a heart attack. Fast forward again, I met R, she was funny and really caring almost like a mother. But all good things must come to an end. I broke her as well. I had the habit of hiding truths, I convince myself it isn’t a lie but I am a habitual liar. I lie so well I believe in my own lies. I became violent, I bullied her, abused her mentally and manipulated her. She broke up with me and I finally see myself as this disgusting monsters. I’m not sure why I’m posting this but maybe a bid for salvation but this time I’ll actually go through with my suicide. I’m tired of being what I am. I always thought being myself is okay, it isn’t.

It's not only the matter of romance, love and tenderness between us. She was simply the best, the smartest and the most unique person I've ever knew.

Now she is gone. I did my best for her funeral and helping her parents, and now I'm contemplating the life and find no further purpose in it. It is bleak, boring and full of despair. I just can't do anything now.

I tried to kill myself twice when I was 14, and nobody knew about this. I'm 17 now, and my mind is pretty much the same. 


All this time, the thoughts are always the same: everybody is always better than me at anything I do, and no matter how hard I try, I will always fail. If i start having interest in something, I quickly give up, because i don't even try anymore.

My mind's answer to any major problems in my life is always suicide.

I have almost no friends and spend most of my days in my room, playing or reading. Playing games used to bring me happiness, and just a way to escape reality, but i've got into online games and they have quickly made me more angry and depressed. 

Being honest, the only reasong i don't kill myself is because of my mom. I can't do it to her, mostly because she's depressed too, and she would probably end up killing herself. Another reason i had was ""I want to see what's going to happen in the future"", but that doesn't help anymore. The world is becoming even worse, and the future will be shit, no matter how impressive the tech or something else will be.

I had so many dreams when i was a kid, and they got shattered when i started to grow, one by one. I pushed away most of my friends, and i'm almost completly alone. There's only one person left, and i always count on him to talk me out of killing myself, but he's probably going to leave me too.

So, to be honest, i don't know if i can stand much longer. Probably not, since these thoughts are becoming more and more frequent.

We lived in a nice house and even though it was boring, I actually had friends. We've been poor all my life and it's one of the main reasons I've always wanted to kill myself. I have an autistic brother who I love, I've dealt with 17 years of getting ignored because he needed more attention, getting attacked because he was upset. We could never control him, our house was always a mess, no doctors or anyone would ever help us. My mom had to do it mainly by herself, a 6-foot toddler. Our old house was damaged badly, my brother was constantly throwing things, making holes in walls, all of that. We couldn't do anything to stop him because he would just overpower us, leave us bloody. It got worse at the end, he dumped everything he could find, laundry soap on the floor, a huge hole in the wall from him rocking. He would get so upset and attack me, my mom and my sister, we were scared to get near him.   


We finally got approved to put him into a home after years of them telling us they couldn't do anything. We finally got out of the grasp of my dad and came out here to make a life for ourselves. We warned our landlord what she was getting herself into when we first moved in, she was too busy trying to get down my father's pants to listen. She's been harassing us ever since we moved out. Calling constantly, telling my mom to come up there so she can discuss the repairs. My mom cant, she has to find work, finish college. She sent us pictures of all the damages and said she will sue if we don't pay up, but she doesn't want to. My mom can't pay anything until she finds a job, and if the landlord keeps telling her to come down she won't be able to pay anything.   


I just can't handle this anymore. We've spent all these years having no one believe us, no help, nothing. And now it's just getting worse.

I wanted to discuss getting a new antidepressant as well, so she referred me to a psychiatrist.

&amp;#x200B;

I talked to the psychiatrist in January and, like an idiot, I mentioned my plan to kill myself the summer of that year, which resulted in me being handcuffed and dragged to Emergency Psychological Services, where I was repeatedly misgendered by staff when I wasn't being totally ignored, the only vegetarian options for dinner were bread and carrots, and I was just generally made to feel broken and subhuman. I was let out 24 hours later when I said I didn't plan to kill myself in the immediate future, which is something I had never planned to do in the first place. What I learned was that if I was honest about the severity of my suicidal thoughts, I would be punished.

&amp;#x200B;

After that, I went shopping for a therapist, but none of the ones who seemed like a good fit were covered by my insurance. So eventually the hospital set me up with a psychologist. Our first meeting, she asked me what aspects of my body made me dysphoric and then laughed at me when I included my feet on the list. That same meeting, after I expressed concerns that if I scheduled a vaginoplasty, my insurance would change before I reached the scheduled date and I would no longer have any hope of affording it, she told me it would be possible to get the surgery within a year, which was a bold-faced lie since even the required electrolysis in preparation takes at least a year, and she would know this since she also works at the gender health clinic.

&amp;#x200B;

Every subsequent meeting has involved her trying to get me to talk about my self-loathing and hopelessness and then telling me I'm being irrational the moment I even begin to articulate anything. This is apparently what cognitive behavioral therapy is. When I tell her this all makes me feel stupid, she retorts that that too is irrational since even though I've never had my IQ tested, it's probably fairly high according to her magical powers of psychometric clairvoyance. In other words, I'm stupid for feeling stupid.

&amp;#x200B;

And now my homework is to imagine a set of life circumstances which will make me happy and which I can realistically achieve, which I'm too stupid to do. I've ruined some of the most important friendships in my life along with the only romantic relationship I've ever had with my incessant self-loathing ramblings, and that whole episode of my life ended with me being told to get therapy, yet apparently, I'm too stupid for therapy to even work at all. The only solution I can see is to kill myself, but I can't tell any mental health professional how badly I want to or I'll be sent to Crazy People Jail again.

I've self-harmed frequently in the past week. I've began googling ways to end my life, and I think I have a few ideas mapped out (if I don't die from them, at least I'll be in extreme pain, like I deserve).   


Why is is today I'm ready? Well, today my mother had a heart to heart with me (I've been staying with my family post-grad school to save money) and told me that I'm bitter and in a bubble with a smile on her face. Told me I needed to get out and try something new, and that I'm hurting her and dad by choosing a boyfriend who makes me very  happy and doesn't do anything to upset me/tries to be as helpful as he can, but hasn't been in much contact with my family due to distance and the virus. She told me that she needs to get back on weight watchers too (we've both overweight, which is something I dwell on daily), and when I told her that my grandmother had a talk with me the day before about how disappointing my boyfriend is and how fat I've gotten, she just smiled and said ""grandmothers just say things like that, you should know that by now"". She left hugging me and telling me if I ever needed anything to tell her. If I were to tell her I've been considering suicide, she'd absolutely tell me I was crazy. When I told her at a younger age that I felt that everything was my fault, she said I ""belonged in a mental institution and never say things like that again"". 

I can't tell my boyfriend, he's already done too much for me. I can't tell my Dad because he has so much on his plate, and my brother has a good life ahead of him. At this point I feel that there's no one left to reach out to, and I've hit my limit. I think tonight I'm going to harm myself again, and if things escalate, I'm going to take a fistful of my depression meds and see what happens. If I don't die, at least I'll be getting what I deserve.

Now, being stuck at home again, whenever we argue or I just sense they’re upset with me I can’t help but deal with overwhelming feelings that they just want me to kill myself.

This is not a plea for help, this is a suicide note.


 

 
My life has never been very good. But I’d say it peaked at around 5. This was before my father had became an alcoholic,  before he became abusive.

It was also before my mother had died. Don’t text and drive kids.


Life was alright then, we were a fairly stable family, not poor, but not rich. 

A fairly happy family, if you will.


I was 7 when my mom had died. I don’t have many memories of her unfortunately. 
My father had gotten into alcohol as a coping mechanism for grief.
I did not do well with her passing. I was upset about it for years, it still makes me tear up when I think about it.

When i was around 8-9, this is when my father started to constantly yell and scream at me. I started wanting to run away, though I never did.

I was fucking  suicidal at age 10.

He started getting more aggressive when I was 10. Now, not only would he yell and curse at me, he would throw things. He would threaten to break things that I cared about. I always had a certain plushie that I was very attached to because it was one of the last things my mom had gave me and because I had accidentally spilled a glass of water because he had scared me, he decided to rip it in half in front of me. I was absolutely distraught. And for some reason this had stuck with me. I never trusted him with anything since.


I am 16 now.  I recently moved in with my grandad, who is the sweetest person I have ever met. He actually supports me and my flaws, my sexuality and me being a furry.

But I’m afraid it was to late.

to everyone who has ever cared about me, for whatever reason,
Please know I am deeply sorry. Please remember the good times we had. Not this.

I want to make an impact on the world in a positive way.

I fear that I have a low IQ, I have never been tested out of fear for a variety of reasons I will get to. This has always terrified me as since having a low IQ means that I will not be able to contribute anything meaningful in any way. Thinking about this has led to what has now become a depressive disorder which requires me to go to therapy. I have dyspraxia as well which has led me to have a bad short term memory. While I have attempted to eliminate things such as bad balance and have been able to play piano up to grade 5 and onward I have yet to improve my memory, back on topic however. Is there anything that I can do to improve my intelligence in any way possible, are there any conflicting theory's to the idea of IQ that might give me some IQ? all would be appreciated please.

I have OCD and it leads to intrusive thoughts and fears that I did terrible things in my past , during childhood and early college.

I’ve been beside myself for the passed few weeks. I think I have struggled with intrusive thoughts my whole life but this time it is really getting out of hand and I’m a total fucking shipwreck . I constantly sit back and worry if I committed a serious specifically sexual abuse with a childhood friend or if I came on too strong with a girl at a college party who I was dancing with. 

I could be completely blowing these out of proportion and overthink them because that’s what OCD does to your brain but here are all the things I have done which torture my brain and constantly need me to get reassurance from other people including you all who I don’t even know. This is like my 10 th post.

1. I licked my friends foot when I was around 10. (This strikes fear that I sexually abused him, even though it was a weird thing I did as a kid, everything is fine with us today.)

2. I was kinda a bully during 11-13 years old. And I feel extreme guilt for it. I apologized too many people over Facebook and they told me not to worry about the past. But I feel a lot of shame for it.

3. I have a childhood friend who I picked on and I wasn’t the only one. I remember as kids we always did weird stuff especially as boys we would horseplay , wrestle , ball tap each other , cheesecurl (stick a finger up someone’s butt as a joke, ) and I think on some occasions dry hump as a joke randomly on each other for laughs. I have been so terrified that I did something sexually inappropriate that I can’t remember and I’m afraid if I sexually assaulted a friend even though the weird things we did were jokes and supposed to be funny. I randomly hit up this kid from my childhood and he told me we were kids and not to worry about anything and that we are cool. But I have a fear that I may have done something bad and that he might not remember it . My brain drives me insane and feel like it plays tricks on me.

4. I danced with a couple girls at college parties but we were all on the dance floor together and I kinda just started grinding with them from behind and never saw their faces. Eventually I made out with both of them but from behind . I made a move after we had been dancing for awhile but I’m afraid that they might have felt pressured or I came onto them too strong and they felt scared and didn’t know what to do. I am not a bad person

I’m losing my mind here I can’t fucking take this shit. 
5. I grabbed a girl I was dancing with butt at the bar. She didn’t seem to mind and she was grinding on me but I just get scared I made her feel uncomfortable we were both drunk. But dancing on each other and it was fun. She never yelled at me or anything.

I am so afraid all the time that I sexually abused somebody or that I’m a bad person and I need constant reassurance that I’m not bad. Most people tell me these things aren’t a big deal and I’m being to hard on myself . My therapist says it too that kids do weird stuff don’t be too hard on yourself and that the stuff in college dosent sound like u did anything wrong. Somebody please help me GOD. I can’t deal with this anymore I wana die from the constant guilt. I wana be a good man.",SuicideWatch,I have intrusive thoughts which make me want to end my life and fear I did something terrible,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/gpxl8b/i_have_intrusive_thoughts_which_make_me_want_to/,True

Not only that makes me want to kill myself, I also have nobody in my life who loves or cares about me. My “family” is full of physically, verbally, emotionally, sexually abusive pieces of shit. I have no true friends. I’m currently in an on-off romantic relationship with someone who doesn’t truly love or care about me, but at least it’s better than having no one, right?

I don’t think anyone better will want to date me anyways when they find out I will have over $100k in debt just for undergrad. No, I didn’t go to a private or fancy school. I went to a public university in my state and just fucked up. All for a stupid and useless degree that won’t even guarantee me good jobs because now you need a masters degree for successful jobs, and I can’t handle any more school. Getting bachelor’s degree makes me want to kill myself. I already got my associate’s degree before going to a public university, so no, I can’t go to a community college and take classes for cheaper. I just have to take the rest of the requirements for my degree.

I’ve fucked up a lot in school because of poor mental health. And today I just got an email saying that I won’t be eligible for federal financial aid anymore because of my GPA. So now I have to apply for private loans and will be getting into even MORE debt. 

Oh, and I also have credit card debt. And can’t even keep a job because I get stressed with school and working at the same time. And I can’t take time off of school to just work, not at least for next school year. I can’t get out of my lease for my apartment for next school year so I might as well take classes if I’m living at the school, right?

I already know I fucked up by taking out student loans. My estranged dad who is an abusive POS (but has money) told me my whole life he would pay for my college. That’s the only nice thing he’s ever said to me. I thought he was going to pay me back for all the abuse he put me through. Then when I got accepted to college and was ready to go a month before, he says he won’t pay my tuition anymore because he thought I told family members he abused me, I denied it, and said he didn’t believe me. I literally never told anyone he abused me because I was afraid of him and wanted him to pay for my college like he said. He was just trying to get me tell him if I did tell anyone or not, because he cares about his appearances and didn’t want anyone to find out about what an abusive POS he is. And my mom has enabled it and never spoken up about it and let me become a victim since I was born because she was afraid of him too. The great kicker of this too is that now my dad is fully paying for my younger brother’s college tuition and he goes to the same college I do. 

I just wanted to get out of my abusive mom’s house as soon as I turned 18 so I took out loans stupidly and went to college. I changed my major lots of times, took a year off, did poorly when I went back and fucked up in college. I just seriously want to die. I don’t want to live in poverty and be a slave and work forever just to pay back all of this money for a stupid mistake I made when I was young. I don’t even want to finish school. I have no support system or people to help me financially or emotionally. 

I’ve been researching a lot more lately about a relatively easy, not too painful, quick way to kill myself. I just want life to be over. I seriously don’t see ANY reason to stay alive. I truly have nobody to stay alive for or who would truly care if I died tomorrow, except for maybe my old dog who will probably die herself within a couple years. 

I really can’t go on anymore. I don’t want to stick around to see if anyone will love me. I doubt it will happen. I’m almost 21 years old and still nobody has ever truly loved me in my life. Why would I stick around and wait to see if anyone does while I work tirelessly the rest of my life and stress about debt? My life is so worthless and pointless. 

I feel happy thinking about me being gone and not dealing with the bullshit of life. But I’m also kinda nervous about killing myself because I don’t want to survive.

I want this all to come to an end. What's the point of hanging on when nobody even ur family cares about u? My whole life I've been both physically and verbally abused by my parents. I didn't even have a proper childhood, I spent most of my childhood in my room bc that's where I felt the safest. I have vivid memories of my dad coming home drunk and beating me til I was gasping for air. Those memories still haunt me to this day and what keeps me awake at night. I don't think ill ever truly recover from that trauma. 

On top of that I have no friends. nada. Maybe a few acquaintances but they make it very clear they can't stand talking to me, so I just leave them be. Also I fucking when ppl dismiss my problems and act like I'm making this up. I really wish I was so I didn't have to live through that nightmare. whenever somebody shares their story whether it's about sexual assault, abuse, depression, drug/ alcohol abuse etc, people automatically think they're making that shit up for attention/ want people to feel sorry for them. That's not always the case tho,  Which is why a lot of people are afraid of sharing their story bc of ignorant people like that. 

I'm almost finished with high school yet I barely made friends or went to parties. I can't help but to feel jealous When some people don't gotta work a day in their life and get everything handed to them on a silver platter.  I have to work harder than everybody else to get where I want to be in life as I'm a WOC, This puts me at a disadvantage at life. Honestly this post is all over the place and nothing I'm writing is making any sense. I'm writing this on my bathroom floor crying uncontrollably contemplating what my next move will be. 

It's 4 pm rn and I spent the whole day like this, it's pathetic af to say the least. I'm ready to just give up altogether. I'm planning on actually doing it tonight and I'm not going to back out this time. I heard ODing on alcohol is the least painful way to go, hopefully that's true. Ill finally be free of this horrible ass life. I know absolutely nobody is going to read this shit, so what the point in wasting my time writing this? I guess it helps getting if off my chest idk.

I just cannot help but think I made the biggest mistake of my life by finally transitioning. My life has only gone downhill since then (about 10 years ago). I hate my body. Even after surgeries. I want more of them. But what’s the point. I first attempted suicide when I was like 10. I was able to drown out my issues with drugs and booze for like 15 years.

But maybe I should just kms before I end up homeless or worse. Cuz no matter what I do. How much group DBT or CBT therapy I take.

This cloud still follows me everywhere. And sometimes it’s a storm and sometimes it’s just a small cloud. And I’ve been able to ride the waves for a long time. But idk how much more I can take before I just jump ship.

In the last four years my life has completely fallen apart health wise and I can't handle it.  This lock down is just the icing on the cake, right!  Where to begin...

I have MASSIVE health anxiety.  I have OCD so I just stress about it all the time.  Every little thing.  I drive myself crazy and live in fear 24/7.  I hate it.  I hate it so much.  I'm terrified every time I go to the doctor so I just push appointments back and I have no problems I probably need to be seen for but no one knows what's going on anyway....

For starters, my bladder is failing.  Just fucking failing.  I have to pee all the time.  24/7.  Every 15 minutes to an hour.  I never get any fucking sleep and I have to be careful what I eat because anything that is spicy, citrus, vinegar, processed will make it worse.  I have been to Mayo Clinic for two weeks getting tested and no one knows what's wrong.  There is no cure, no solution...  nothing.  Eventually, I'll probably have to get it removed which is terrifying.  The muscles don't work it in...  I have to pee using my abs....  It's maybe really small but they can't even tell, really.  I hate it.  It has ruined my fucking life.  I am always tired and no longer enjoy anything because stuff I did like doesn't work when you have to run to the bathroom every 5 minutes...  in fact, I am so sleep deprived that I can't find pleasure or interest in anything.

What else?  I have massive acid reflux....  LPR all the time.  I have to sleep sitting up and I can't take meds because they make my stupid fucking bladder worse.  I am always suffering.  I'll probably end up with Barrett's esophagus.  I already have massive welts all inside my throat and no one knows what they are or why they are there.  My doctor wants to get a bioposy and I think it's from reflux, one lady says maybe allergies...  who knows?  But they flare up and hurt.

I have seasonal allergies but not like where my nose runs...  more like where my whole head feels like it's caving in and I get massive pressure behind my eyes and my whole body hurts like I'm getting the flu - this happens if I go outside for like a whole day and then I have to suffer for several days until things calm down meaning I can't even enjoy being OUTSIDE during this stupid fucking miserable pandemic.

I just found out I was pregnant in February but I am just such a fucking mess medically and emotionally even and was terrified by this pandemic that I got an abortion five weeks later.  I'm 38.  I'll never have kids now I'm sure.  I killed the one I would have had because I'm fucked up physically and too much of a coward to face what might have been...  

My family sucks.  My brother was my best friend and he killed myself after we got off the phone one night.  I was so destroyed that I drank myself into a stupid every night for the next ten or so years.  My sister is older and a drug addict and alcoholic and she's so much worse than I am or ever was and so selfish and entitled that I can't even related to her or talk to her much at all.  Also, she just says really mean hateful stuff to me all the time.  I can't even repeat it.  My Dad is a total narcissist who never invites me home or makes any effort to see me.  I drove across the country to spend Christmas with him but then he said, ""Let's play it by ear...."" and I was so hurt I ended up pet sitting for someone 45 minutes away from his house for two weeks before turning around and driving back across the country.  I never told him I was there.  He spends all his time doing things for the church.  He's donating everything to the church when he dies.  I could certainly tell some stories about him - but mostly when my Mom got dementia he put her in a horrible care home an hour and a half from my house (even though there were much, much closer and nicer ones) where she was abused and died from bedsores.  She had a horrible death and I visited her every day.  He would go on vacation for weeks and not check in.  Two weeks every two weeks because he needed some 'me' time.  The day she died she howled and cried in agony and I begged him while sobbing to come see her - three days I sat with her and he never showed up until the last hour.  Exhausted I went home and he put some huge post on Facebook about how he was alone with her when she took her last breath and they were together until the end.

The best thing I have in my life is my husband and I love him.  He is the only thing, everything.  The only thing that is good.  I think without him I would have no reason to go on.  And I don't think I treat him as well as I should because I am so angry lately.  I just get so angry and I feel awful for being that way.  I just feel like a big blank slate inside or a husk.  Everything I used to love seems to hold no appeal.  I can't concentrate on anything and I don't know how to get right.  How to get my head right.  I wonder if this is the beginning to dementia, early stages...  brought on by drinking too much.  

Ugh, I hate myself.  I needed to get this off my chest.  I will probably delete this, but it is kind of nice to just say it all...  

I'll add I've seen lots of therapists.  That never helps.  I do the homework.  It never helps.  Bleh.",SuicideWatch,I feel like I want to kill myself,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/gpcwhw/i_feel_like_i_want_to_kill_myself/,True

The Quarantine fucked me over. I suffered from depression in the past, plus other thing, was very unhealthy and lived a very destructive lifestyle. Anyway I'm from Italy and basicly work in the tourist sector. Had a job but because of the lockdown and the fact that I hated the way they manipulated custumers I left. I think I made the wrong decision. So I'm jobless because I'm idiot. Also started university again but I'm so down right now that I can't even study. I'm applying for jobs but nothing. I used to walk and eat right. Took care of myself and that was one of the things that lifted me out of depression in the past but right now I feel so down and lost that I can't even do that.
I am so scared at the idea of ending up depressed as I was in the past but I feel it happening again and I find myself unable to stop it.
Now that we can move again I don't even have the energy to meet with my friends. Can't even talk with anyone. People all have problems right now. Real ones and me falling back into depression doesn't seem a huge one. Plus I don't want to bother anyone.
And the thought of suicide is starting to cross my mind. I'm not going to do it. But can't see the point in living either if I'm going to end up depressed and wishing upon death. 
Anyway how do you cope with it? Maybe it's just because of the lockdown. But I'm so irritated. I've worked so much to overcome it and in just 2 months all my progress is gone.

But no being bored takes precedence over her only remaining family members life. If he dies I will have no one left and be subsequently homeless. I’ve been on the phone all morning trying to get him out of the lease he signed with my “sister” and her dirtbag “boyfriend” and theres no way to do it without having them sign a paper which they will refuse to do.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello, i'm 21 years old and i'm from Chile. I'll try to be brief, but i want to give a little backstory to what's going on with me lately begining with my childhood. 

My life's never been easy probably like most of the people around here. I was bullied by my classmates when i was younger because i was fat and shy *(including some degree of physical violence, not that terrible like most thing i've heard though).* Most of the time my grandfather *(who's my father figure since my father apparently abandoned us and later passed away*) and my mother acted as my emotional pillars as well as teaching me to be nice, kind. Thanks to my grandfather i learned to stay positive no matter what. My mom however is somewhat depressive and tends to lose it a lot *(this also affected me)*. My mom, my stepdad and my grandparents overprotected me a lot as well, so if anything ever happened to me they would inmediatly attack anyone who tried to harm me, sometimes  even when it was not big deal at all. 

2010 and 2011 in particular were very rough years for us. After Chile 2010's earthquake i started having panic attacks like everyday and it was horrible, my parents were having economic problems as well. To make matters even worse, my Arts teacher, who's was my ""main"" teacher that year always tried to make me look like a bad student and a bad boy, even tho most of the past teachers though and said otherwise. This lead to my whole class rejecting me, on top of being unable to shower due to the money shortage as well as the fact i had a fight with my only two friends because of this teacher, which led them to reject me as well and leaving me alone. I spent 2011, 2012 and part of 2013 alone with no friends at all. **During this time i had my first suicidal thoughts and tried to suffocate myself, once. I stopped because my family needed me and i couldn't fail them.**

My life started to recover afterwards and everything seemed a bit brighter... Thanks to my parents, grandmother and specially my grandfather.

My grandfather passed away during mid-2015 and this led me to an emotional breakdown, a horrible and chilling one. My past self started to fade away entirely, no longer being the kind and nice guy. I tried to fill the emptiness with whatever i could, friends, family, videogames, anime, food *(I lost a lot of weight before and after this event i started gaining weight once again).* In the end, i tried out love, and it turned out for worse.. 

To be brief, once again. I became obssesed with a girl i met online who had a bf on another country. I was so overly obssesed with her i even tried to harm both of them *(somehow, i guess).* In  the end she blocked me and it took me a really long time to recover from that event. **I had suicidal thoughts once again, but never tried to harm myself**. Afterwards i sweared to god i would never ever become obssesed about someone ever again... And as you will read soon, i failed miserably.

After this event i had my **first and second gf** (both of them manipulated me and the latter cheated on me). **Nothing really special** here, those relationships just failed. **My third gf** however, was a special case. This was the first person i truly fell in love with and loved. Our breakup hurted me so badly i couldn't get over her loss thus leading me to be in another relationship in a desperate attempt to forget her. This fourth relationship was horribly toxic and lasted two years, including manipulation and some sort of physical abuse from her. I also had my first sexual experience with this person. **This girl changed me because i inherited part of her toxic personality as seen during my last two relatonships.**

Also before this fourth relationship i finished school and begun studying architecture, moving from a small city to the capital, huge change if you ask... caused panic attacks to come back at me. During all those years i struggled a lot with my career, my family as well as the fact that my school friends stopped talking to me entirely after we split up, leaving me once again alone with only my family and distant friends to help me out. Later on i would meet new friends who helped me out all the way until now, preventing me to take some dumb choices of life.

Anyway, right after this breakup i spent several months believing i was finally free and better. This was true and my **fifth relationship** was truly awesome save for one fact... She had a psychological issue that truly complicated our relationship a little bit. We never had a fight, we never had a problem.. but.. i felt that the right choice was to broke up with her to protect both of us, and so i did... I hurted me so much to leave her, **she taught me a lot, i loved her, i was her first irl bf and also her first kiss (nearly first time as well).** We both suffered a lot, but it was for the better and i'll always carry her on my heart.

**And so... with such a huge baggage on my back came my sixth relationship, almost a year ago. This is where my current problems lie at**. I really fell in love with this girl, and to this day i believe she's the love of my life. But my baggage, insecurities, toxic personality and everything quickly showed up and ruined everything. I behaved like a cellopath, controller, and toxic obssesive asshole almost like a psycopath, yes, obssesive, i failed to myself once again. I turned my love into obssesion and harmed her. We broke up, then came back, broke up again and it was all over... I've lost her. She gave everything to me and i didn't gave a shit. **My breaking point came, and i tried to commit suicide once again, throwing myself out the window of my apartment. I just couldn't take it anymore. University, love, family, friends everything felt apart at the same time and made me break. I was... one centimeter away from falling that night, to end it all, but i didn't. I saw my grandfather sitting next to me. He didn't wanted me to give up, and so i did.**

**It was all over?.. No. I begun my seventh (and to this day final) relationship.** I'm not going to talk a lot about this. I hurted this girl, badly like, i truly broke her heart, player around, enforced her to do things she didn't like at all (not physical, only text-based or emotional).  I made her hate me and faulted everything in my life to her, like she was the one responsible for my misery when i was the truly miserable jackass who just couldn't get over his past. 

I thought... my grandfather should truly be ashamed of me, he didn't taught me to be like this. My mother *(then seriously worried i would try to commit suicide again)* would feel ashamed too.

Supported by both my family and friends.. i decided to change, give myself a time to reflex and think. And i found myself, i found that kid who was happy before, even with everything he suffered so far, felt better, became better and got over my past, or most of it... it seems.

When i believed everything was closed up i tried to patch up my relationship with my now two ex-gf. The seventh never replied back, the sixth did.. and.. I realised i still loved her, even with everything that happened, i still felt a huge love and devotion for her, not the obssesive one.

Sadly... she didn't. And i tried to bring her back to me, it wasn't possible. She just couldn't forget what happened and hurted me so much, because my love for her is huge.. but i failed to her. And lost my way because of this, because i was past-driven most of my life, and i lost myself only to find myself and realize the one person i wanted forever in my life was gone. **Last week i thought of ripping my arm open until i bleed out, but i just couldn't bring myself to try such a thing again. I have the means to do it, it's just the fact i'm not able to.** I know my grandparents, my parents and everyone else who cares about me would suffer if i did such a thing, but i barely feel any emotion nowadays, i'm not able to cry anymore, i just, laught out of pain.

Love is obviously the least important thing here, **my guilt is what's driving me insane now.** Having her close is a constante reminder of what i did, what i used to be, how bullshit i was. 

I've been my entire life with psychologist and psychiatrist treatment if you ask.  I just need a helping hand, someone telling me there's something after this, and really giving me a real reason to not give up beside my family, friends and career (I'm not able to find a reason on them). **Guilt is really driving me mad... and i don't know how long i'll be able to handle this before i kill myself.**",SuicideWatch,(Long Post) I really need some help.

Today she told me she wished she would have died and that I’m the reason she even went drunk driving and crashed the car.

they won’t let me be set free.

but the only thing keeping me here is the gravity that ties me to earth.

people tell me I need to go to school and keep learning.

But how can I focus if all I feel is hopeless?
Always distracted while others reacted.

The whirling hurricane inside my brain,
presents the everlasting pain.

Breath after breath,
I’m thinking about death.

one day i might just quit.

Everyday I hide behind a mask,
hoping someone might just ask…

“Hey are you okay? And what are they?”

Well they’re from my self-harm.

This is what society has driven us to,
you finally see what they made me do.

After several panic attacks yesterday, I went for a drive to try to clear my head a little. Ended up at a secluded bridge in a small neighbouring town. It was about a 25 foot drop into a very shallow river. I climbed the edge and just sat there, thinking, going back and forth with myself for about 4 hours. Ultimately decided not to do it as I didn’t have big enough balls and I wasn’t even sure if it would have killed me. I know it would have destroyed my parents, but they’d eventually learn to live with the loss of their son. Even if they didn’t, living for someone else just isn’t a good enough reason to continue on, I need my own reason.

It's hard to imagine that there is anyone out there with a similar thought process and state of mind when you've lived your entire life searching for any such person to no avail.

I've lived my entire 21 years alone alongside neglecting parents who've substituted their presence during my childhood with video games that were supposed to fill the void. I had close to no social training during my earliest stages of life, and so the only friends I could've made during my childhood were through the games I played at the time. At school I was only known as the eccentric shy kid that no one would bother themselves with. I grew up playing a lot of RPGs and FF. I remember at a very early age I got my hands on FF7 for the PS, I must've been 8 or 9 at the time. I played that game on and off for years, I don't think I beat it until I was 12 something years old. At that time I had already familiarized myself with the game and all it's characters, I had grown up associating my personality and sense of self with this game and the many others I had played. As time progressed throughout my childhood I only became more and more eccentric and weird considering everything about me was based off video games and a culture no one really understood. I never managed to find anyone I could've called a close friend, and in my later teens I had learned to keep to myself and not open up to anyone as it would only lead to confusion and on my end, hurt.

Why live, when you can only eat what is absolutely necessary to survive, when there is no path towards a better situation in sight?

Why live, when life takes so much, yet rewards so little?

Why live, when the companionship of others is unsustainable or impossible under the emotionally crushing pressures to get by, to just make it through another day?

Weakness is always a burden, no matter the circumstance. 

I can't be strong. I cannot be consistently strong for others, let alone for myself. 

I feel so tired. Overcoming the fear of death seems easier than trying to find happiness in a futile life.

I cannot be a friend, for to truly be a friend requires resilient strength. I try to at the very least be good to the people I love and to the people around me, but that alone seems to mean so little in the struggle for independent security. 

For a person to have to try to carry his own weight, but to also have to develop himself into something of use to society, to have to strive constantly to prove himself. To have to engage himself mentally at all times without reprieve, unable to afford frivulous and hedonistic distraction.

To have to decide the meaning of his struggle, to assign it worth. Even more difficult, to remember that meaning and have the presence of mind to never forget it at all times, because one cannot afford to become unmotivated, which is the direct consequence of continuing anyways.

The last one is very special to me, but I don't know why. They don't care about me *at all* which hurts cause I have a bit of a crush on them. They talk to me more than the other two do though funny enough.   
I wonder if they would care if I killed myself. Probably not, but it's a nice thought.

I would rather not go into particulars, but this lockdown has been particularly bad for me, making me feel as if I am running out of options. I would like to preface this by saying that my problems are not economical/financial in nature and that although there is no immediate threat to my livelihood, I have been finding it more and more difficult to just keep up. 

My anxiety coupled with depression ensures that I can't do anything I want to in my life. I feel like I have deep commitment issues. I feel like it's difficult to commit to anything: gym, GRE (somehow got a good score without studying much), projects etc. I can't commit more than the first two days for anything long term. Couple that with the fact that I have nobody in my life that I can really ""talk"" to. I have trust issues with my parents, and sure I have friends, but I have always seen them as like-minded people to hang out with. 

I have this morbid feeling that my time is near, even though I have a more than healthy fear of death. I just feel backed into a corner. There are times when I wish that I would jump from my second-floor apartment, I would probably not die, and only end up shattering my legs, which weirdly enough does not seem to be a bad thing. Other times I wish I would get a heart attack, and although it seems improbable at this age (I am not exactly obese), my heart does feel like it acts a bit erratically nowadays (probably gotta do something with how my anxiety and depression is at an all-time high nowadays). 

And then, lets say I scrape through this particular episode, I am afraid that the next one will be worse. Am I to spend the rest of my life like this? What chances do I have of not smashing my brains in the next two-three years? What about when I turn 30? What chance do I have

I told myself two years ago the same exact sympathetic bullshit some day blah blah I’ll be living my dream life I’ll be happy in a year or so, we’ll that shit never happened and now I’m at my rock bottom I guess maybe I’m writing this for some subconscious reason to find a reason why I should fucking stay when I know I shouldn’t. Everything happens for a reason, I’m just one of those people that should kill themselves. I’m a background character that kills themself and then the people I know in my life have that pivotal, “ Oh I know my purpose in life like I won’t take people and life for granted anymore because this girl in my life killed herself,” bullshit I have fucking no clue what I’m saying I’m rambling. I’ve attempted suicide many times never successfully because I’m a little bitch, the first time I was 11 I wish I would’ve committed that time I guess something inside of me wants to stay for whatever reason and I don’t fucking understand why though, I don’t fucking get it. Therapy doesn’t work for me and my mom didn’t want me to get on anti depressant meds because “ they’ll change me,” or some anti Pharma bull shit like that.

Now she sees me deteriorating day by day and has no idea what to do about it because she reminisces of the memories she has of me as a little happy girl. Idek what to do now I guess this is my last chance for fucking someone to say something to change my mind the last straw before I really make up my mind idk. I’m not a danger to myself rn because if I were to ever kill myself I’d  never do it in my house where someone has to find my dead body that’s fucked and gross I wouldn’t wanna do that too anyone and since we’re quarantined you know and I can’t leave and I’d have no reason too, I’m am a child so.

""It could be worse"" is terrible logic. The fact that at any given moment, it's possible for things to be characterized by even more suffering is not a reason to live. 

""Well, at least you're not starving or at war."" 

So we keep chewing cud and try not to blow one another up, we work and tell jokes - and like Kurt Vonnegut said, just ""fart around"" until our genetic program runs out of energy, or we run out of oil. 

Great plan.

It could be more beautiful, more wonderful, more amazing in countless ways. And so much of our lives are characterized by describing and imagining how this could be so. And we've moved into this vicarious simulacra of projection into a digital world where it feels like, maybe, just maybe, something interesting is happening.

I just want to tell someone my thoughs here, because i have really nobody to tell my problems.

I'm 16 years old, i live in Germany and i have a problem.

Everything was perfect until a couple of months ago. It started in February. Our schools closed and we had to go in to lockdown. Since that Day everything began to get worse. My parents dont went to work and they started arguing and have a very bad realationship right now. Better said. They are very close to getting divorced. That was not everything. Since a few weeks ago we are allowed to meet in 3 person groups outside. But somehow my Friends dont want to do anything anymore with me. I barely get messages from them and if i ask to go outside they say no. But then i see on instagram their storys how they are outside together.

It is like my life makes no fun anymore. I don't feel the joy that I had before. the last days i just stand up sit on my pc, cry, think and since a few days ago im thinking of ending it all. I just remember every day my failed suicide attemp back in 2016. Back then i took an overdose of pills and then i landed with much pain in the hospital. As i arrived i couldnt breathe anymore and i was very close from getting a liver failure.

I also want to tell my parents my problem and that i want a therapist, but im somehow too scared to break their hearth or making the current situation even worse. I know the worst thing that can happen to them is my death but i really cant anymore.


But i think i will do nothing the next few day nothing. I have no plan yet and I don't want to risk anything. 
I hope someone can give me an advice how I can get a therapist. Without making everything worse

Why now? I don't know. Coincidence? Starting a part time job? The appointment with a new psychiatrist Monday that made me think about how utterly ridicolous I am? The prospect of taking meds? Because I have no hope they're gonna work. And if they don't its over. I don't wanna live like this. I don't wanna kill myself. I just wanna die. Stop everything. Maybe this is a bad dream and I'll wake up.

Tomorrow I'm seeing my psychologist. I don't know if I should tell her all of this. What if I am just being dramatic? I WANT THESE THOUGHTS TO STOP TOO. Always second guessing myself. Why. Everything I do my brain finds a way to put in a negative light. I'm tired. I'm tired. I'm tired.

I should message my dad. I don't want to. I don't miss him. Haven't seen him from before the quarantine. I'm a piece of shit. I deserves to die. But I'm gonna hurt other people. I don't want to. I don't want to. But maybe I have to. I'm scared of failing. I'm scared of keep trying to make this work. It's not gonna fucking work.

I have a best friend who is my ex girlfriend. We are currently on a 'break' from talking because she is struggling herself and I was upset that she wasn't replying to me and her messages were curt. 

I just can't deal with it though. The thought we won't ever be the same. We won't go back to normalcy. What if she likes the silence? What if she prefers me being gone? 

She has suicidal thoughts too sometimes but whenever I ask if she's ok and remind her I'm here for her she ignores it for hours and sometimes doesn't even reply. 

I just don't mean that much to anybody. I've already sorted out any loose ends I'm just waiting until I move in two weeks.

I live with my grandmother and today I checked the stimulus check website IRS to see if I would be getting money to get out of the house and buy myself a used car just to get to point a to point b nothing special I didn’t care how it looks. I am in a house that influences and gave me the money for drugs, and set me back. Today I found out that I would be getting my stimulus check so I told my grandma and she immediately says I’m calling the county attorneys office to get you out of my house, the reason being she said she put me down as a dependent and I wasn’t allowed to do that. Every time I asked her why she was calling she just said stop badgering me or im calling the police. im threatened by the police every single day , im stupid and don’t even know what that meant until now being a dependent. I live in a small town and have been arrested once for fourth degree assault, my grandmother came at me throwing wine glasses at me cutting me all to hell. I got arrested that day for assault because I pushed her against the wall to get her off of me, she was in my face and hitting me and I did NOT put my hands on her until then all I did was push her against the wall and said stop please. She called the police right after that and I told them everything that happened the truth what I did to get her off of me and got arrested because they seen a “red mark” on her neck. They posted my picture on Facebook police station and ruined me. I look like a woman beater now, they put it in the news paper and everything.

I’m honestly not sure if I’m depressed or not because I’ve never been diagnosed. Especially in an Asian country, where having depression is basically taboo or your family doesn’t want to have anything to do with you if you get diagnosed. 

I basically feel like my parents don’t love me at all. They only love my elder brother. Because he’s smarter than me. They’ve always compared me to him and I always feel inadequate. 

I help around the house, I do the laundry, cook, clean but to them I’m just a lazy slob. 

I cry myself to sleep almost every night because I’m so tired of living. Sometimes I feel like I want to commit suicide because I feel my life isn’t going anywhere. I’m 22 but my mother always says when she was at my age she’s already graduated from university and has a job. While I’ve just started University. She keeps saying I’m slow and stupid. 

Not to mention when I got tattoos and my parents found out (back in 2017) my dad slapped/ kicked/ punched/ strangled me. Because of tattoos. He says only prostitutes get tattoos. I wanted to kill myself that day. My mother saw everything happening but never stopped him. When my dad just beat my brother, she would put herself between the both of them physically. But for me? She just stood there and watched. 

I wanted to call the police but she said I would be “breaking up the family”

Right now I’m so tired. I also have been having issues with my boyfriend. I’ve posted in another thread that you can see if you’d like. 

I’m just so tired of living. I don’t feel like anything is ever going to get better. I feel I’ll forever be unloved, and I’ll die alone. I don’t think anyone will ever miss me.

Moving on, about 3-ish months ago I had a group of 3 friends. This one kid eventually kept making stupid comments and around the 14th, he called me a crackhead.

She said she would and lo and behold, she didn't do shit. 

I eventually got fed up with the other kid (not the one who texted the kid I yelled at.) because he would always say ""I don't care"" in a way that made him look like he was trying to be funny, so I stopped being friends with him. After that, I left that friend group entirely. Another one of my friends heard about the incident and was on the side of the person that texted the other person to stop. I eventually decided that I should just delete all of my contacts.

&amp;#x200B;

Ive had major depressive disorder since I was 6. I have paranoia, extreme general and social anxiety, a few sensory issues, Ptsd, and anger issues. thats it for mental stuff uwu

i started getting depressed when my mom beat the shit out of me for not eating (5 years old)

my mom called me insane and lied to me up until I was 12 about her ever abusing me so I constantly thik everything I say is a lie for attention because thats what she would tell me. and when she addmitted shes abusive she blamed it on my (just like she and my step father blame me for everythig wrong in life)

Ive been bullied literally since preschool

Ive hated how I looked since I was 7. anuwuday is my insta, you can see for yourself how distorted and grotesque I am. Currently I weight only 98 pouds and im a whole ass 5'9 feet tall. Absauletly disgusting. a tall and skinny freak with a hunchback and long ass alien looking hands, just what I love to see. No im not anorexic, im literally the opposite. I used to overeat so much i had to me sent to the hospital (wich my parents were forced to do by the school) but I have a shit ton of (untreated) medical issues and some of them prevent me from eating a lot, I can barley eat half a full sized meal. And my metabolism is on a 24/7 rave so that doesnt help.

&amp;#x200B;

Im constantly paranoid and I an never sleep because im convinced theres a an watching me, waiting to kill me. idc about him killing me bt I can see his big ass creepy eyes staring holes into my literal soul.

&amp;#x200B;

I literally unintentionally ruin everything. Im not trying to be depressing I just literally ruin everything

&amp;#x200B;

My parents could care less about me and my mom only cares about if im working on school or not. They dont care about my intrests or passions and only care about if they look like somewhat good parents to my school so cps wont be called.

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever they get cps called on them my mom gets pissed

&amp;#x200B;

when my dad learned I cut myself on a daily (when I was 12. ive been cutting since I was 7) the only thig he said was ""did you at least wash the knife?"" so thats a good representation of how much my family cares.

&amp;#x200B;

My mom is a piece of human trash who uses her illesses to prey off sympathy of others, get wants she wants, and get attention. chronicallyrara is her insta, you can see how much she pitys herself for attention. That skank even uses her illess for good grades in college. she even has a fake (morbidly overweight) service dog.

&amp;#x200B;

Up until this year practically all my teachers said I would never amount to anything and they treated me like shit.5th grde teacher, when I was crying cause a kid called me an ""ugly annoying bitch"" (this is in cali so of course a 5th grader talks like that) the teacher and everyone else saw me crying and the teacher just went ""Everyone please ignore her. Lucy, stop it. Youre fine"" and after I cried more she got annoyed and sent me to the princeples. in 3rd grade I yawned in class and the teacher went ""Wow. Im so sorry that this lesson isnt exciting enough for you Lucy."" and I told her I was just tired (cause I hadnt slept in 2 days thanks to my crippling fear of my mother) and the teacher sent me to the princeples office for ""backtalking and making excuses"" the thing was im pretty ure the princeple thought I had some form of autism? So she was extra nce to me and let me hang out with the special ed kids whenever I was sad, having a meltdown, or being left out of class activities. So, thats nice? 

Im always blamed for literally everything and no matter the situation people always find a way to blame me for everything. like in 5th grade me and a group of girls were learning the whole Indian burn thing, they all burned me so I was the only one who got hurt and I asked if I could do it to one of them and a girl named faith reluctantly let me do it but she didnt like how it felt so they reported me to the principle and I had a week and a half of lunch detention. 

&amp;#x200B;

M grades are literal shit and I have no will to do anything other than art and even then sometimes I dont want to do art. right now im finishing 8th grade with 32 missing assignments from 2 weeks of not working and 29%'s in alost all my classes except 2. my art teacher is chill and she knows what im going through so instead of doing her work assignments she just lets me turn in my art for credit. She also sent me a needle felting kit because she knows I have a huge ass list of art things I want to do and that literally the nicest thing anyones ever done for me. but anyways- with my shit grades and shit work ethic I cant get into a good college wich means I cant get a good job wich means ill end up homeless or working in mc donalds for the rest of my life justlike my mom predicts. 

&amp;#x200B;

oh yeah- ive never had a bithday party- well one that I can rememebr. for my 9nth birthday my mom invited all of her friends to our house and had a party for herself. the people brought their kids, one got to blow out my candles and another opeed my presents (wich I didnt even get to keep cause my mom threw them all away during one of her temper tantrums) so thats nice. I got the bee movie and I really wanted to watch it but I got yelled at for being disruptive (aka asking my mom if I could watch it) so I went to my room and cried and my parents screaed at me because I was an ungratefull bitch yada yada. A thing to note is my parents scream literally centimeters away from my face. its not fun.

I was manipulated into doing sexual stuff by two dudes who were my friends when I was 9. one guy was like 14-16 (i never knew his age) and the other was 12. 12 year old told literally everhting what he had me do but said shit like ""she begged for my dick"" and stuff and then I was harrassed and slut shamed for 2 years until I moved.

My depression is so bad that I am not able to attend university or to have a job. I am tired to be unlovable, worthless, unwanted, rejected, ugly. I am touch strarved and sometimes I just wanna feel human contact, a caress, a hug, but men are disgusted by me. I have never had a bf, I am virgin and kissless at the age of 22.

We have always thought of eachother as soulmates, and nobody here can convince me other wise so don’t bother. We’ve always talked about marrying and having kids too. When I was a kid though I didn’t think it bothered me but having been molested twice, my father leaving my single mother when I was 2, and always being abandoned by any friend I have, I’m a deeply insecure and immature person. I’ve been in therapy for a month since we separated. We separated because of the following. Because of super high ego and insecurity due to getting into modeling, along with hornyness I cheated on my soulmateI was so disgusted and repulsed with myself. My gf months beforehand got back into smoking pot despite having addiction problems and didn’t tell me about it which now worries me even more. 
It is my fault and mine alone. I regret my mistake horribly and I don’t know what was going through my head. In an effort to grow up and mature, I confessed to her a month afterwards, and that was a month ago now. She was obviously devastated. I told her that I take full responsibility, that I understand her pain and suffering, and that if she’ll allow, I want to show her how much I’ve grown and that it was a one time thing.
Anyway, my gf and I were checking up on eachother till she decided the other day that it may be best to take some time for ourselves and that she’d let me know if she needed anything. So now I won’t really be knowing if she’s safe or not but I also don’t know what’s gonna be going through her mind which scares me. She said she doesn’t know what she wants. I moved out of the apartment and don’t worry I’m still paying rent, we were sharing it with a girl roomate, and I then moved back in with my Mom (who is a surrogate mom to my gf and loves her a lot too)

Even though I’m glad I smartened young and before 30, I feel like if we were to end things, then I lost out on my one chance for true love and a family. My girlfriend and I have lived together for 4 years, talked in detail what we want our wedding to be like and what our kids names will be. I know I’m young but I’m intelligent enough to know that she’s the love of my life, and yes I did a horrible thing but it doesn’t mean I don’t love her with all of my being. I don’t want to be with anyone else and expect them to live up to her. I don’t wanna have kids with anyonelse but her. So yeah, if things don’t go right, I feel like I’m going to kill myself via helium tank. I’m a trust fund kid, so if I died my mom and uncle would get it to retire. My gf would be named heir. And I’d freeze my sperm just in case my gf wants it or my mom wants grandkids, whatever. But I’m terrified of killing myself and what it would do to them, but I’m terrified of living. Most people especially my age hate me off the bat anyway since I don’t smoke, they think I’m “rich” for having a trust fund despite living in an inner city, and for being a little good looking. I want to show them my suicide letters and beg them to forgive me and have a second chance because I’m scared of the future, but then it may be seen as manipulative. She even said as of rn that she can’t begin to appreciate any progress I’ve been making or improvement I’ve had. I’m so directionless rn. I know I can get through not talking to her as much, but if I lose her, idk what I’ll do.",SuicideWatch,Femoral artery or Helium Tank,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/gm9slw/femoral_artery_or_helium_tank/,True

I failed out of college in 2016, took a semester of 2 classes and worked a commercial cleaning job for 9 months. Got clean. Got my head in straight. Or so I thought. 

Did a year of school again, fucked up one class, but did ok! Drinking a lot became commonplace then, and that spurred my gap year of school where I basically drank and did drugs and begged god to take me naturally. Begged. 

I’ve been trying to work the 12 steps after gettin Arrested in January. Longest HONEST run I’ve had is like three weeks sober. Just can’t man. Just can’t. 

I have like $1k to my name, two parents who try so very hard to understand and love my distorted brain and provide empathy when they feel able, but I can’t get a handle on this. 

Been in counseling since 2012, and I can’t shake it. All this work and coping led me to the lowest feelings I’ve ever had. I’m only 22 years old, and NOBODY, seriously NO ONE PERSON would ever tell you I’m sensationally depressed.

The tunnels I speak through in regular conversations and the way silence is the loudest noise I’ve ever heard are becoming exhausting.  

I’m so scared. So I guess that means I wanna be alive somehow. I guess being all the things I grew up scared I would become is something I survived more than something I STILL have to fear.

Every morning is such a struggle and I experience anxiety throughout the whole day which has gotten to the point where I am physically uncomfortable almost 24/7.

I have so much anxiety and am so unsure about my future, I know what I'm going to do (as in, my job) but I fear having to go through this day after day. I don't see a happy future, just somebody who keeps going every day because he needs te keep living for some reason. Society doesn't want me to kill yourself but makes it hard for me to get better. 

I don't have any friends and I don't see a future in which I have social contacts either, it feels lonely now and I can't even imagine how lonely it'll feel once I move out of parent's house (I'm 20, in my last year of college). I have so much social anxiety which is fueled by my extremely low self confidence and feelings of inferiority. At this point I have no idea how to act socially, so becoming actually acquainted with someone seems out of this world. 

I'm so afraid of everything, every single moment of the day. I'm exhausted mentally and physically. Right now I'm in bed, it's night, and I feel like I'm going to die tomorrow.

I feel silly about getting help, my parents don't take my feelings very seriously. I'm just whining about problems which don't really exist, it's not like I'm struggling with living because of having no arms, or having a terminal illness. It's just that my brain is stupid.

But, if you don’t believe me, please stick around and read while I clearly describe why you’re wrong. This might be long, but please do read if you have the time, I would very much like to talk to anyone afterwards because I’m in an extra bad place in my head today for some reason.
 
     When I was a kid, I was the smartest in my grade. I got the best marks, I was friends with everyone, all my teachers loved me, it was great. From junior kindergarten all the way until about grade 10 it was like that. I played tons of sports too, starting pitcher in baseball for years, starting quarterback in football, starting point guard in basketball, I always had the leadership position and I don’t know why. I’ve always been on the quieter side, socially, but peers have always looked to me for advice, or help with something, and I enjoyed helping others, so I just kept doing it. 
     All through school I was nominated and elected for things like student councils, student leadership summits, and tons of workshops that only a select few kids from each school would go to. Even though I really didn’t enjoy being apart of these things, I still did them, they made me look good and I did enjoy being able to make at least a little difference in my school community afterwards/during. Everyone always knew me as the happy kid, I was a little shy, but I was always smiling and i always would cheer everyone up when they were down. I remember hearing about depression and stuff like that when I was younger, and I always thought about how I could never be depressed, my life was so good, literally zero major problems, I even remember thinking about how happy I was, and how it definitely would never change.

     For some reason I’ve always been avoiding a romantic relationship. Even when I was younger, I would get asked out by beautiful girls in my class that I even had a crush on, and still, I turned them down. To this day I can’t wrap my head around that, because it happened like a dozen times in school, but now, I’m 20 years old, never had a kiss, never held hands, never even been on a date, and I cry nightly because of how lonely I am. I’m even good looking, that’s what makes me angry, I’m not even ugly, but still I’m a baby when it comes to talking to women, or anyone for that matter. Late last year I did make an effort to express my feelings for a girl, that’s something I’ve never done before. I guess it could have gone worse, but still, I don’t have a girlfriend. She had just been cheated on a few weeks prior to me asking her out, so I got smacked with the friendzone. Which I was fine with at first, I gotta start somewhere, and being friends with a girl is at least a baby step in the right direction. Over some months we got to be pretty good friends, and this girl is just delightful, she’s definitely one of my favourite people on the planet. We have the same sense of humour, both of our faces completely light up when we see each other, and even though I’m on the shy side of the spectrum, I could just talk to this girl forever. She constantly tells me how awesome I am and compliments me, and that’s another thing I’ve never experienced before, which makes me sad because something as little as a compliment literally brightens my whole entire week, and yet I’ve gone my entire life without getting any. She does confuse me though, it’s been about 8 months since I asked her out, and at this point I’m assuming nothings gunna happen, but, SHE continues to make plans with me, some of which are surely over the line for a male/female friendship. Things like cooking new meals together for us to try, making pillow forts to watch movies in, we’ve even been walking thru a park around Christmas time, all the Christmas lights were everywhere, we had peppermint hot chocolates,and we just walked around talking with each other for a couple hours. She knows I have a romantic interest in her, and she actually seems to like hanging out with me, so I just don’t know what I should do next.

     Now onto the source(s) of my unhappiness. I live in a very small town, only about 3000 people, so all thru school we had about 60 kids in my grade, that’s why it was easy to be friends with everyone, because everyone knew everyone. But after grade 10, our high school closed, and the 400 kids in our school were forced to split up across the school board. So I went from living a 15 second walk from school, to an hour and a half bus ride every morning to a school with over 1000 kids, when I was used to not even half that, and I was already shy before that point.
     The next year, I was diagnosed with scoliosis, it’s a spine deformation that usually occurs in pre-pubescent GIRLS, not almost adult males. Normally, a back brace for a few months will help it, but my case was not normal, and my spine curved 88 degrees in 5 months. So grade 11 was fun, my spine was curved like the letter S, and I was in constant pain and had severe breathing problems, so in grade 12, a surgery was scheduled or else I was going to die by my own spine puncturing my lungs. I needed spinal fusion, basically they opened up my back like a set of curtains, and drilled two metal rods into either side of my spine, then they cranked it straight, and stapled me up. It was an 8 hour surgery, and I had 96 staples in my back, from my neck all the way to my hips, which also isn’t normal, most cases are only a small portion of the spine, not the entire thing. I spent 2 weeks in the hospital, worst of my life, then I spent almost my entire senior year of high school at home learning to walk normally again, trying to gain back some of the 40lbs that I lost in the hospital, and realizing that my own family was getting fed up with taking care of me, like it was my fault or something. Before the surgery my doctor told me it would make all the pain go away, only costing a bit of flexibility. Wow what a liar that guy is. It’s been over 2 years since I had that surgery, and I constantly have about a 7/10 on the pain scale, my entire torso hurts. Also, I can no longer bend my back AT ALL, zero movement, I have permanent perfect posture because my spine is now 1 bone. It feels like I need to stretch constantly but no matter what I do, I can’t bend that way anymore to satisfy the stretch feeling. It takes me hours to fall asleep, because all I do is toss and turn, just trying to stay comfortable for longer than 30 seconds until I have to move again to get another 30 seconds. I had to stop hanging out with my friends over a year ago, because who wants to hangout with someone who can only party or have fun for like an hour, then they need to go lay down to recharge. So rather than them slowly begin to not like me because of that, I just stayed home, which I now realize was the worst thing I could have done. I found out pretty early on that the only thing that actually makes the pain go away, besides serious painkillers, is weed. Which sucks big time, because yay no pain, I can actually feel normal, but I have to get so high for the pain to go away, that I’m completely useless. 
     I took a year off after high school to work as much as I could with the pain I still had, and I managed to save up enough to pay for my entire college tuition. I started college last September, and now it’s May and I’m dropped out of that. My parents didn’t want me to move away because of my back, so I settled and went to a college in the city closest to our town. That hour commute every morning combined with sitting in a terrible chair for 5 hours was just awful, made my back pain even worse, so again, I started just staying home. Because I stayed home, I got terrible grades for the first time in my life and it sucked.

     I really don’t like living anymore. I hate waking up, I hate going to sleep, I hate everything I do throughout the day. And it’s a shame, because before Coronavirus lockdown, I was JUST starting to be more confident, I was making an effort with girls, and I was feeling like I could handle actually hanging out with my friends again, I miss them so much. I was taking care of myself, getting some more energy, eating better, but oh no, now no one can see each other any more, and now you’re not allowed to leave your house, so I’m trapped in my room for even longer by myself, alone, once again. Now, what do I have to look forward to? I’m only 20 years old, there’s so much of my life left still, yet I know for the rest of my life I’m going to have this awful back pain constantly, with no way to feel normal again. Yeah pain is bad, but say I stop caring about it and live my life normally, oh wait, society isn’t going to be the same when lockdowns are lifted, and I already dropped out of college, so I have nothing moving forward. I’ve tried hundreds of hobbies, just searching for something I’m passionate about, but nope. I’m good at all of them too, I have fancy oil paintings that I’ve done, 3D printers, tons of edited videos, working design files that I designed myself, hundreds of drawings, books and stories I’ve written, knives and weapons I’ve forged from scratch, cooking, playing instruments, and a crap ton more, yet all of it means nothing, because it’s just sitting in my room. So now I’m just some partially disabled virgin renaissance man, and that’s it. 

     What makes it even worse? My problems aren’t even bad compared to some people’s. I’m complaining about practically nothing if you compare me to someone whose been raped and abused for example. Yet all I think about is not wanting to be alive, so how sad must those people with real problems be?:( So now I figure I’ve hit the point where I have 2 available options, move somewhere far away, and start my adult life on my own, where I can be myself and start fresh, oh wait, that option probably isn’t as easy to do any more and never will be easy again, so let’s take a look at option two.

I'm sorry to bother you all because I really hate complaining about myself. I've always been told that if you're unhappy everyone will fly away from you and I guess that is pretty accurate. I'm also sorry if you happen to spot some mistakes cause English isn't my native language. And this is gonna be quite long so I don't mind if you don't wanna read this🙂
I've always thought about suicide, even at the best parts of my life, I guess the thought was there and it never went away. I realized early I wasn't like other people, and I'm not gonna give you some details about it, but when I was 10 I just somehow realized that other people's brain would work slower as mine (not to be pretentious, it really isn't something I wanna brag about because I wish I has a lower IQ), and that other people wouldn't think about death and violence in the same positive way as me. 
Truth is I have weird thoughts, and I seem to work in a weird way. I lie, quite often, I do some things not politically correct, like cheating on a person I really love, and I do not feel any guilt about it. But I do feel guilt, whenever I, for instance, don't take a friend to the restaurant they would have like to go. And I guess that is because I have a high intellectual potential, like all the emotional drawbacks that come with it.
Or maybe it was because of my mum. Because she never bears any responsibility for anything she does. She opens a door, knock her head in the door, and yells at me, telling me I'm a slut, I don't Care, I'm a whore, I'm an egoist bitch, when I always tried to protect her from the people who would talk in her back and from men who'd tried to abuse her. 
Yeah, let's talk about men. I am a second choice to men around me, but strangers and older men would just try to abuse me in any way they could. Like my best friend's father. Eh, I couldn't tell anything, don't wanna tear their family apart. Plus he didn't touch me that much. 
Truth is I don't care. Well, I didn't have much sexual experiences, but I never felt aroused by them. Though I watch much porn. But I guess what I am really attracted to cannot be spoken out loud for it isn't acceptable in our society. So yeah, I'm not gonna act on it, I'm not gonna speak of it either here, cause that's not gonna help me in any way. 
Now let's talk about this year. I went to the top college in my country, but I didn't like studying science. I was kinda forced into it but I can't find the motivation to work. So I don't get good grades and everyone is disappointed in me Cause I've always been Top student. And I feel like no-one cares about me. Like, people I like are the only thing I care about in this world, and they just keep telling me all their problems but won't even bother to remember one single thing I told them. And that's how it was with that boy, first time I ever had feelings, he was, like, so good at everything, we were best friends and then more. But I just lost all my confidence and started to act weird and he left me. And I don't know, I messed everything up, I'm not worthy of everyone and I can tell they don't give a shit about me. 
And I just feel like life is pointless, and it won't do anything to anyone if I leave. Sometimes I just crave, like physically, for a blade through my lungs or my wrist. But truth is I cannot even cut myself properly because I'm not strong enough.
And I've come to a point that everything I'mma do is gonna make me puke.And that hurts so much when I'm breathing.

I remember wanting to just be dead so much and having this base instinct not let my hands do it. I tried and tried to over come that instinct but I couldn’t, my hands would just lock up.

I hate being alive I hate knowing I’ll never like how I look, how no matter how hard I try I’ll always be the wrong sex. I hate how even though I know suicide is the only answer I still can’t force my hands to do it, I still can’t get past that base instinct.",SuicideWatch,I will never be comfortable in my own skin,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/glnl2i/i_will_never_be_comfortable_in_my_own_skin/,True

Things I believe:
1. If you can get covid 19 more than once, a vaccine will be useless against it.  If antibodies don't work after getting sick, why would they work after getting a vaccine?
2. This is being used to control people, and everyone is buying it!  Not saying there's no virus, but people are way too afraid.
3. We should not let the pursuit of saving lives (noble as it is) ruin the lives of those who are not at risk.  It is unfortunate that deaths are occurring, and I have the deepest sympathy for those at risk and their families, but we are stopping others from living to prevent a few from dying.  Doesn't make sense.
4. If what they are saying is true, this will never end.

I have lost my inheritance, lost my father, lost my health, lost my laugh -- everything. I have lost almost everything.

I sometimes dream of a new start somewhere else, far from the baggage of it all. I often return home and immediately become incensed, breaking things and screaming. Sometimes, it makes things feel better; in other instances, it only causes a scene. How I loathe my life.

There is no point to this post. I've made five or six just like it, across various accounts. Sometimes, it has been a passing bit of anger, and in others I was sure that I would kill myself sometime soon. For whatever reason, I keep staying here.

I wish it would just happen. Quickly. My life has no value, and my legacy will be that of another faceless casualty, shown in abstract on a graph of ""rising suicide rates in America"" that makes the rounds in the news for a day, and is then promptly forgotten thereafter.

On top of that, I had to buy a car in order to get this job, so I'm invested to the point that, if I were to be fired, I'd go bankrupt before I could get a new job. (And I'd be in some deep health-trouble since I wouldn't be able to afford insulin during that time.)

I feel like I'm drowning. I really want to just let myself sink, but it isn't just me I'm living for anymore. My wife is diagnosed with clinical depression and requires medication for it, so I can't exactly let her know I'm feeling this way.

I used to have a serious issue with just wanting to end it all back in high school, but I got some help through a therapist. That's impossible now since I don't have the option of scheduling appointments due to my job.

I’m currently living with my girlfriend who is suffering from depression. Well her mood is really inconsistent as she could be in a really good shape for two weeks and suddenly breaks down on really small issues. For example she was cutting my hair and she accidentally cut herself. I was playing chess online as she told me to keep my head down. my head was in the game and so I didn’t act quickly about the cut. She then said she felt like I didn’t care about her. Even though she said she accepted my apologies yesterday at night, but she’s still not feeling happy today. When she’s depressed she would only cry but is not willing to talk to anybody. She sometimes told me to leave her alone only to accuse me of not being by her side a few minutes later. I honestly don’t blame her for this at all, but it kind of messes with my head also. I’m being really cautious when I’m around her, my heart would skip a beat if there’s a slim sign of her being unhappy. I kind of do everything she wants me to do so I don’t have much time doing the things I want to do or working on the things I need to work on. As a result, I could only work on my things after I put her to sleep everyday. So I recently would go to bed until 4 or 5 in the morning. Also I don’t have much expectation or excitement for plans we made, as she would sometimes change her mind about certain things and I can’t say no.  I’m scared to make plans for myself as I don’t want to leave her alone. I love her so much and being in depression is not her fault, but I don’t know what I should do moving forward. 

By the way, we are from China and only moved to US last year for school. She started having symptoms about 2months after we arrived. At first we thought it was because she was under a lot of stress for a financial risk management exam. However after the exam she still didn’t feel better. Then we thought it might be because she met some obstacles with finding an internship, but after finding the internship she still didn’t feel better. Now she thinks it might be because the cultural difference and the language barriers and is really looking forward to going back after we graduate but I don’t know what to think anymore. She reached out to mental health consoling and was under treatment for some time. But she said she didn’t feel comfortable with it and it didn’t help much. She is indeed doing better than December and January when she was at her worst, but it’s wearing me off I don’t know how long I could hang in there without breaking down.

Like I knew who my father was without actually knowing my father as a person or I knew a concept like lying was bad without knowing why it is and why I sometimes do it.

I think I knew what suicide was from very early on as a little kid but I never knew what it actually was until later. I remember learning the first I recognised it as a thing with actual force which can affect me when I went down a Wikipedia rabbit hole and landed on the Absurdism page. 

I was 12 at best and somehow found my way to philosophy texts on the Internet and reading about how life has no meaning and what not. There it's discussed that Suicide is a ""solution"" to the inherent meaninglessness of life. And somehow this spoke to me. 

Being a kid with no attachment to family or religion or friends or community I could see for the first time that someone else actually felt like me and hell they even have academic essays discussing things similar to how I feel. This was the first time I actually imagined what Suicide was and why anyone would do it. 

A year later was when I first had my first suicidal thoughts. I would say they were trivial seeing as I was mostly fishing for attention at the time but its ten years later now and they've persisted. Of course I can say my more mature brain has a better understanding of that original text I read as a kid and how suicide wasn't actually being proposed as the Final solution to anything but I still wonder whether my younger self was more in tune to how I really feel to only see it as THE solution. 

Right now I can't tell whether it was a good or a bad thing that I found about suicide in the midst of the bursts of loneliness and despair I felt as a kid. I don't know if learning of it in a better context like a counselor would've prevented me from being where I am now. 

All I can conclude is that it was quite the rush to actually find words to describe how you feel especially as a kid and it's hard to find new words to replace them the more you identify with meanings of those first words.

(14 year old female, btw)

So this happened yesterday night. I wasn't doing very good mentally, and I ended up barging into my parents room to ''talk'' to them. I was angry so I was being rude(I am taking full responsibility for this). The topic was something mundane, but my parents were watching a movie and they ended up just yelling at me to get out. One thing that they kept saying was that I was making too much noise, so after my dad slammed their bedroom door in my face, I was beginning to have a panic attack. Remembering what they'd said about making too much noise, instead of going to my room, I went to the living room which was farther away from where everyone was sleeping. Now when I have a panic attack, I usually cry, but I don't make a lot of noise. I also wanted to be more safe than sorry. So I'm sitting on the couch biting my arms so that I don't make any noise while I'm crying. Over the last week or so, I'd been feeling depressed again. I thought that I'd gotten over my depression, but I feel like a failure for falling back into it again. I talked to my therapist and and I tried to cover it up by talking about my anxiety instead. Talking about my depression is very hard for me to do, and I really thought that I'd put it all past me. I didn't want to tell anyone about it because I don't like causing trouble and I was worried that my parents would get exasperated. Neither of my parents understand my depression/anxiety, so I just felt even worse. I mean, they got me a therapist but they don't *actually* understand what I go through, if that makes sense. A thing that my mom does is that when we get into fights she says that I play victim in front of my therapist and that I actually ''have it so good here.'' That makes me feel really bad about myself and it makes even more difficult to talk to my therapist about my depression.

Anyways, this panic attack brought all those feeling to the surface and they all burst out. Around 7-10 min later, my dad came and started yelling at me to go back to my room. I said ''go back to watching your motherfucking movie.'' I was still crying so then I said something along the lines of ''you don't care do you! I've been hurting myself for weeks!'' and then my mom came and then they started yelling at me about how I treat them like crap all the time. Then they tried to ''listen'' to me, but it always turns into them listing everything that I've ever done wrong. My parents were like ''why didn't you say anything/why were you lying to your therapist'' And I tried to explain but my dad was angry because ''he pays a lot of money for you'' and he basically only cares about my depression when it affects my wallet. So then my dad started yelling at me to go to my room and I didn't reply because when I go into a panic, it's hard to move and talk. My dad proceeds to grab me and throw me on the ground. This triggered even more panic in me because in the past I was abused by my mom(she doesn't anymore) and my dad knows that. He even promised me that he and mom would never hurt me again. SO this scared me so I started screaming and me dad dragged me to my room by my arm(I was on the floor) and slammed me against my bed. I was temporarily dazed from hitting my back and head against the wooden frame/edge thing on my bed, plus I was on the floor. Then my dad stomps or punches me really hard on the back which leaves me dazed for a sec while he slams the door and leaves my room. I start screaming hysterically because this is triggering all sorts of memories. For context, my dad is 6'3 and very tall, so I was unable to defend myself. My mom is shorter than me, and if it was her I would've fought back. The shock, pain and panic made it impossible for me to fight back against my dad. 

I got up and went  back out of my room and was shoved in once again. My dad screamed in my face several times and at this point I was seriously scared for my life. I tried explaining to my dad how I was feeling and he accused me of bullshitting, and that I was ruining the whole family. He then goes ''go kill yourself then.'' as if  nothing I was feeling was even real. I was so scared and I wanted to call 911 so that I could leave and get away from him but he took my phone and wouldn't let me call. He said I only wanted to call 911 to get him arrested. So I was shaking and in a daze and he kept screaming in my face. My mom tried to get him to stop but she was preoccupied with my two younger brothers, who were crying. At this point I gave up and tried to look for something I could use to cut my skin. I couldn't go to the kitchen to get a knife because my dad would beat me up again. I only had safety scissors which were useless. I did have a nearly full bottle of emergency anxiety pills, but no water to swallow them down with. I tried very hard to  cut my skin with the scissors but they didn't work. I remembered that I had a razor so I grabbed that and was in the middle of deciding weather cutting my leg or arm would be easiest when my mom came in and basically talked to me. She tried to help, but she wasn't doing a too good job of it. Most of the conversation was what I did bad and if I knew the consequences of saying ''I'm gonna kill myself'' as if they thought I was bluffing which I WAS NOT. She then goes to describe the great life I have here, completely missing the irony of the situation. I could tell she genuinely wanted me to calm down and relax and make me feel better, but again it just was everything I did wrong in a nutshell. 

This affected me really bad because I've been working on getting over the years of emotional and physical abuse I suffered when I was younger, and then my dad goes and says that I'm ungrateful, everything is my fault, I'm what's wrong with the family....Now those thoughts have resurfaced up again and this time I know it's true. Because my dad also has depression and he KNOWS what saying those things do to someone, but he didn't care.

During the pandemic I look after my mom and everything to do with her when my dads not home (giving her food and drinks, making sure she's okay). She's advanced to a stage where she can't talk properly anymore. 

For the past few weeks I've been feeling extremely suicidal, before the pandemic I was already so depressed that I was missing weeks of school, and there was nobody at home to force me to go so I'd just stay at home with my mom. My motivation for work is severely lacking to the point where I'll feel like crying just from looking at work I need to do. So right now im months behind school (not even including all the work they've set online during the pandemic)

So the other day I thought ""I'll just do all of my work for art, because that's something that I don't need any of the months of lessons to be able to do"". And I started writing down all of the things I need to do.

Skip forward to today. I went downstairs for some reason (I think to ask him to help with my work) and we ended up talking about my mom. And I mentioned something about how she always used to play with other kids but would rudely refuse to play with me. I said it was probably because her alzheimers was developing.

This is when my dad hits me with a bomb. When she had me, she had postpartum depression, and because she was stubborn and furiously independent she refused to get help with it or even acknowledge there was anything wrong with her. So, she never became attached to me, and then she started developing alzheimers. So she never started loving me.

My whole life, the one thing keeping me sane was that at least I knew that my mom loved me. Because my dads become depressed and irritable recently and it seems like he hates me sometimes. And I've just found out that she never loved me, at all, for any of my life. 

She used to push me into walls when I was little, and blame me for everything, and always take my brothers side in arguments. I don't even know how to ride a bike because she'd always refuse to take me out to do it. And I always thought that it must've just been alzheimers. But all of this was back when the only signs of her alzheimers was that she'd forget her keys sometimes. So she just hated me. All my life I've thought she loved me, but she hated me. 

And im just, struggling to see the point in living in a world where I don't even have the chance to have a connection with her. If she just hated me then I could try to fix it, but I can't because of her alzheimers. I just... Its all too much for me.",SuicideWatch,"About to give up, just found out my mother with alzheimers never loved me",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/gjvwur/about_to_give_up_just_found_out_my_mother_with/,True

I have entertained certain ideas, but never made a plan to actually do anything. But I feel I would rather be dead, and I say to myself that I want to kill myself, although I don’t really know that that’s true. It’s not that I want to kill myself. I’d rather die of some random medical issue or accident or something. But seeing as that is unlikely, it crosses my mind that doing it myself would be the only way. 

My mom died almost two months ago, and she was my entire world and whole life and best friend. Her death was completely unexpected, and it has ruined my life. I no longer want the things I used to dream about, the things that normally would have gotten me through hard times since I was so looking forward to them. But she was so looking forward to them, too, maybe even more than I was, and that makes it impossible for me now because I don’t feel I can do them, much less enjoy them, without her here with me. 

My pain is so great that I don’t think I can bear it. Every day is miserable. The fact that I will never see her or hear her or hug her or kiss her or laugh with her or be able to tell her things just makes me feel panicky and miserable. I don’t think I can live much longer without her. Everything feels utterly pointless and hopeless and meaningless. 

I don’t feel like a burden. I don’t feel worthless. I know there are other good things in my life. I just hurt too much, and I don’t want to live without her. I’m just ready to be with her again. All of the usual things people say don’t help me. I know it’s not what she would want. I know people love me and would miss me. It’s just not fair that I lost the one person I needed most at a young age. It’s not fair that I will most likely have to live longer without her than with her. It’s not fair that she was taken for no reason. She was happy and was not suffering. I can get no comfort, no matter how small, like some people are able when their loved one had been sick or suffering. 

The only things that really have stopped me up to this point were that it would hurt a few key people in my life and my religious beliefs. But those things are holding less and less weight for me as I go. I’m starting to feel almost disappointed in myself for still being alive. 

My therapist says the way out of depression is to give it time and “fake it til I make it,” but that doesn’t make sense to me. I’m perfectly capable of going through the motions. I’ve been doing it. But that doesn’t take away the pain. Besides, it’s not the depression that makes me feel this way. It’s the grief. And I know that will never end. Everyone I’ve talked to says that it never goes away, you just learn to live with it. That’s just not a life I want to live. I don’t want to hurt and feel this way forever. 

I just don’t know what to do. How do I survive when none of the usual things people tend to hold onto mean anything to me?

Last year, I was arrested on suspicion of R (you can guess what I mean by that, I don’t want to be taken down by the auto moderator). The victim, was an ex girlfriend of 3 years, and I’ll tell you what happened. 

One night, we had a party among friends at her house, and a large amount of alcohol was consumed - I don’t even remember most of the night. The only thing I do remember, is everyone going to bed and the two of us alone, downstairs, on the couch. It’s all very foggy, but I recall initiating sexual contact with her consent, but I also remember at some point she seemed unconscious, and I soon realised something was wrong, immediately panic went through my head, and all I could focus on was that she wasn’t awake. I remember vomiting and crying, I went to the bathroom and had a panic attack. When me and my ex girlfriend were together, we were very liberal, very anti-R, pro-communism, that kind of stuff, and I was so stricken with grief over what I’d done, I couldn’t stand it. I didn’t mean to, I really didn’t. I came clean the next day, over the phone, I couldn’t bear to look at her face, and she reacted horribly. Posted everything all over social media, and it caught the attention of many people. We were a well-known couple in the area, being together for so long at such a young age, a lot of people looked up to us and aspired to have a relationship that seemed as wondrous as ours, so naturally it accumulates shares in the hundreds.

I confided in one of the friends that were at the party, and they seemed understanding at first, they seemed to accept that it wasn’t my intention, and tried to make reparations, to no avail. She cuts off contact with me, I attempt suicide a couple of times, and I get into a relationship with my best friend at the time a couple months down the line. In March, I get a knock at the door, a good few months after the incident had passed. It was the police. I was arrested, and taken in for questioning. I didn’t know what to say, at all, the officers dissuaded me from having a lawyer present and the evidence was fairly damning, every last bit of evidence was self-incrimination, confirming what had happened and how much I hated myself for it, even though I didn’t mean to do it, it still happened, and that weight was a heavy one to bear. By this time, my ex/girlfriend of the time had helped tremendous amounts, she reinforced the idea that because consent was established beforehand, and I hadn’t realised, I’ve done nothing wrong. I still felt like I had done something wrong, but it was far less burdening for me. I was subject to a very brutal line of questioning, I tried to tell the detectives that I couldn’t remember almost anything, but they insisted I remember, or I’ll most definitely be thrown in jail without a leg to stand on - so I made things up to get them to stop, I was extremely scared, I’d never been in that situation before, so I tried my best to fill in the blanks with something made-up. Although, the interview ended with me crying and begging that I don’t know, I don’t remember, I didn’t mean to.

I was charged 2 months ago. I’m awaiting trial. My solicitor seems positive, but before my plea hearing, I had a barrister tell me to plead guilty, because I am most definitely going to prison. I pleaded not guilty, because after that moment, any hope I still had left, died, and the only reason I pleaded that way was to make preparations for my suicide. For the longest time, my life has been a constant loop of police interaction, talking with my solicitor, getting arrested, talking with my solicitor, getting calls from my solicitor to write some sort of letter thing with him to the court, having this stupid fucking situation catch up with me at every corner, drinking to absolute nonsense levels and throwing up in my own bedroom most nights. I’m getting fucking tired of it.

I’ve tied many knots in the past couple months, but it has never worked, so I settled on a better method. It’s against the rules to say what it is, but it’s far more silent, a lot less painful, and very easy to make. I feel ready to leave, I’m not sticking around, just to go to prison for 10 years and come out of the other side unable to live any sort of life at all, just because my dumb-ass younger self wanted to show off and drink way too much fucking buckfast and smoke far too much green at a get-together. I’m not doing it. I’m going through with my plan in 2 hours. 1AM is the time my stomach should be completely empty, and I have the highest chance to leave.

It’s a very difficult thing for me to post in here. I am not really ready to share my background and full story up to this point, but needless to say it’s been a struggle for as long as I can remember. I’m a male, in his 30’s, in good strong full time employment. 

As a child, I suffered a number of traumatic times that had a knock on effect on my life to this very day. I have anxiety issues that are spiralling out of control, and am now going through a divorce. 

Since before I was a teenager, I’ve had unwanted intrusive thoughts of the darkest nature to do with killing myself. I have no thoughts of harming another. 

The thoughts seem ever present, but stronger when I am gripped by my depression and anxieties. I will fantasise about killing myself, plan how I would do it, work out ligature points, have sudden thoughts of driving off the road, cutting etc. They just suddenly enter my thought processes and take over. 

Afterwards, I’m left shaken and left with this strange suicidal hangover. I’ve always been good at dealing with them, but they’re becoming increasingly strong and more frequent. For the first time, I’m genuinely fearful of what I may do to myself. In moments of clarity, I know I don’t want to die. But in those dark moments, it’s all I can think about. There is less and less light these days. 

Does anyone else have this? Is there anything people did that worked? I’m due to see a psychologist, but we’re talking about well over a decade of bottle up issues that I just cannot put into words.

last year i came out as trans. i stopped caring about my education around then. people would pretend to be my friend. boys at school would tease me. i pretended to be like them, but i wasn’t. one boy said he would fuck/rape me because i’m trans. i could feel people judging me, that’s why i was scared to attend classes. even though i never let it get to me. people just put up with me. i hate my body too. all i do is hurt myself. 

when the pandemic happened, i was happy school was over. then the online work crept up on me until i gave up on it. i don’t care about school when suicide is my escape route. what do i have to care about? i can’t even imagine going back there. i hope i die before they can save me. i hope i die before i can get worse (if that’s even possible). i hope i die before i go back there. but if i don’t let it get to me, why do i want to die? i don’t know, it’s just mental illness taking over me finally, what it’s wanted to do my whole 14 years of living. 

sometimes i like to act out to make someone care. say that i'm going to kill myself when i don’t actually have the things to do it, which sucks. i hate everyone’s bullshit by the way. “you have so much to live for” “you’re so young” “it’ll get better” shut the fuck up. you don’t know me. i don’t care how much you invest yourself in me. leave me to fucking rot. the world is ugly, let me die young. then you can cry about it. i’m not even living, i’m just existing.

I am born with a syndrome called klippel-feil, and I am starting to really hate it.

I feel like No matter what I do, there is always problems regarding my physique or how I look, and the problems is always my fault. All the things my hart is burning for, I can’t do 100% like everybody else. Everything is always half \*\*sed.

Since I was little, all I ever wished was to be “normal”, I’ve wished it so hard that I almost was ready to die for it. Since I was little, I always felt that people was/is holding back from getting in touch with me, or even talk with me… thinking, is something wrong with this man, why is he looking like that… 

People sometimes laughs or look funny at me when I’m just doing normal stuff like just walking like everybody is, so I almost never go out, or doing something with other people, in fear that People will laugh or be rude and the whole situation will be awkward.

I can talk if there is a subject at work, but if not, I froze, close down completely - Feeling I have nothing to share. I am hopeless.I have limited amount of friends (at least I have 1 or 2, which I am grateful for),

Have no girlfriend, Never had a relationship with anyone - probably because of my bad looks.  
I went on continuation school, “normal” school, and still I talk with none of them (is it my own fault?).  
I have tried to committed suicide 2 times in my life, every time people is just

talking hard to me how I have no respect for others… Seriously, I have respect for other people, maybe more than everybody else, But I just have a complicated life, which is so messed up.

I am honestly thinking about suicide every day, wondering why I am still here. It’s starting to take over my job, more and more I can’t think clearly. Always I’m ridiculously slow at my work, and colloquies is making funny jokes about it.

People always talk about my quality of work is poor, probably why I have been fired from my last 3 jobs. When people around me is talking, I feel hopelessly alone, like I have nothing to share or talk about.

Maybe this is just how it is, I have to accept all of this. Actually, I love life. I just don’t love my life.

I had a massive panic attack week+ ago. I tried to call helplines, but I was so panicked and in hell, that I hardly understood how to write numbers into the phone. I kept missing numbers and screaming in desperation for some number to please work since I was losing it BAD.

When I got the number written down right, the line was stuck. I tried several times to reach someone but the helpline did not become un-clogged and I was not getting any help. This is the first time this happens to me. The situation escalated to me butchering my hand with scissors, I just stabbed it to shreds and had to call an ambulance.

When they arrived to look at my bleeding, non-working hand they were just dismissive and cruel to me. Treating me like I'm stupid, told me that I should've called a taxi instead, completely disregarding that I needed a professional to calm me down. I was helpless and this piece of shit who was supposed to help me just treated me like trash, still having a panic attack and bleeding.

They brought me to the emergency room and the nurse I met there was super nice and told me the first responders were unprofessional and to dismiss their shit. She made me feel so much better.

But I didn't even get to see a psychiatrist, and I was released to go home while still disoriented and out of this world. I could not find the door outside and spent 15 minutes confused about doors. Finally a nurse helped me get out, but I had no money with me and I had to figure out how to get home in a confused state and feeling abandoned.

A friend ended up getting me home.

My hand is still fucked. It's just one big bruise full of stab wounds.

Last year I hurt my foot while having a panic attack and the doctor treating me kept mocking me ""Oh, what a good idea to hurt your foot, I bet it helped your mood haha"" and when I yelled at him ""You do NOT treat me this way!! I'm here to get help and your shit attitude is not helping!"" he then got really annoyed for me not just kindly complying to his shit and he ripped my foot to his lap and started mangling it painfully to punish me for talking back to his shitty ass.  
I tore my foot away from him and he yelled at me ""You need to let me investigate your foot!""  
And I held my ground, I yelled back at him ""You DO NOT treat me this way!""  
He tried to again violently grab my foot, but I pulled it away and told him he can look at it if he'll be nice.  
There were nurses in the same room. They were uncomfortable and afraid. They sat on their chairs kinda looking away at their toes, dis-associating.  
The nurses ended up fixing my foot and they were kind to me.

But it's just so extra depressing to know that when I try to get help, I still have to fight to be treated like a fucking human being. Even the medical staff think I'm a bother and a waste of time. I can't trust the first responders or doctors to talk me out of self-harm or suicide. Even they want me to rather die.

The feeling is mutual. I wish I could piss on their graves, but I'd need to live another 30 years to be able to, and it's not worth it to stay alive.
