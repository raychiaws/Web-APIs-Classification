Domestic Violence - how to navigate this when your loved one is a victim?,"Hello - I'm seeking out advice/support. I'm not sure how to approach and navigate the current situation that is happening with my sister and her fiance. Please share what you would do in this situation. I'm seeking legal advice and emotional advice. Even personal advice/experiences. A different perspective maybe. I'm just trying to figure out how to navigate this situation.  I want to be there for my sister but I want to do what's right as well.   


Situation:   


My mom basically gave my sister a guilt trip today because she never goes to visit them. My sister didn't visit them at all during the holidays last year. No visit for either of their birthdays or Mother's Day. Even though they live only 20 minutes away. My parent's never see her.  So in retaliation to that - my sister contacted my mother today and sent her a picture and told her that the dresser fell on her and that's why she wasn't coming to visit for Father's Day. The picture she sent was of her face. In the picture she has a huge busted up lip, swollen nose and looks like she will have two black eyes soon. After some interrogation from my mothers end (because my mom didn't just fall off a turnip truck- she knew that wasn't from a dresser) - my sister admitted that it was her fiance that did it. They have been living together for several years. Maybe 8 years or so.   


Her (my sister) current stance on the situation is that she is fine. She does not want to leave him.  She does not want the police involved. He is ""not that kind of man"". He feels bad. He's been saying he needs counseling like he's had in the past. His temper just got away from him. Sometimes he sees red. He asked her to call the cops on him after it happened. He wanted her to go to my moms house for the night after it happened.  (These are all the excuses and things she has told me and/or my mother today.) She also said that there was not alcohol involved. It is hard to know what to believe from her though. She also let it slip to me that this ""hasn't happened in a long time"". So even though she told both of us it was the first time this has happened - that was a lie. 

&amp;#x200B;

Full Picture/Background info:   


Some background information about my sister. She is a recovering alcoholic, maybe active (not sure). 34 years old. She has no children. She was married for about 18 months in her early 20s then divorced. She started drinking in her early 20's and went downhill from there. She's always had social anxiety. ""Chip on her shoulder"" persona throughout her entire lifetime. She has a few DUI's from her really bad days of alcoholism. She's been in in-patient rehab facilities. She's told me that she's also a sex addict. She is also bulimic. She's told us she's been raped before. She used to go out a lot to bars and I think there is a lot of things that have happened to her that we don't even know about. A lot of legal things with her life she won't tell us. She bottles things up a lot. I'm not sure if there are any other drugs involved in her life or her fiances life. I know they smoke cannabis sometimes. And I think she is still drinking. She was talking with an online therapist on talkspace off and on within the last few years but she doesn't do that anymore. Her and my mom butt heads a lot because my mom tells her how it is all the time. Last time things were bad with my sister - it stressed my mom out so much that my mother swallowed a whole bottle of pills and was rushed to the hospital to have her stomach pumped. So my mom can't handle this new situation that has now arose. My mom's psychiatrist (from the last drama time) told her she had to distance herself from her daughter, (my sister). And that is now what my mom will try to do again. She won't be able to handle seeing Robyn stay together with an abusive partner. My dad is kind of like me. He's upset about it but doesn't know what to do.   


The ""fiance"" (man that beat up my sister Friday night) has a ""car salesman"" type of personality. He always drives her around when she needs to go somewhere. He's always the one talking when they are together. Robyn is never around my parents or myself without him there. It's almost like she's using him as a crutch. At least this is what I thought of their relationship in the early days. He isn't someone I ever imagined my sister being with. But my sister has changed so much since we were kids. SHe's not the same person anymore. She hasn't been the same since she started heavily drinking in her early 20's. They live in the middle of nowhere Oklahoma. I don't know a whole lot about him. He is the type that will lie and spin the truth. He grew up in a different small town in Oklahoma. He is around 33 years old and has 2 daughters of his own. Both of them with a different woman other than my sister. My sister actually works with his mom at a laundry mat. And even though they are only 20 minute drive from my parents. My sister never goes to visit my parents. (I personally live in Florida. I've been living here since February. Before that, I lived in Germany for 5 years preceding. So I've been physically very far away from all of this.) I flew to Oklahoma just last week to visit them all. I hadn't seen my parents and my sister in almost 2 years. I just moved back to the states from Germany. Now I'm able to visit my parents and sister much easier and quicker. I swear last week when I hugged my sister for the first time in almost 2 years, that I could smell alcohol. If you know someone that is an alcoholic - you know that smell that the skin and pores releases. 

&amp;#x200B;

What to do now?   


So when we first got the real truth about what happened. Of course my mom and dad were ready to get a gun and go after him. Then the next thought was -  to call the police.   
But then we have my sister asking us not to tell anyone, asking us not post anything, asking us not to call the police or to call her fiance. (Which she called her boyfriend today-- which I noticed that she didn't refer to him as her fiance like usual.) We have evidence on our phone of what her face looks like. And her admission to what happened. She was careful not to give too many details about what happened too. She said she didn't want us reporting him so she didn't want to tell us. I did get from her that it happened Friday night and that it was him that did that to her face. And that it was because of stress from money and he ""exploded"".  I tried to convince her to leave him. To move in with me. But, she didn't want any of that. My mom told her she was buying her a ticket to fly her to Florida to stay with me. She didn't want that. Didn't want to talk about it.  She's been saying she's fine. And it's not a big deal. She's asked me not to think about it. She's been saying contradicting things to me all day. For example she said he ""barely drinks"". Then she states later that he doesn't drink at all. Then also she stated that she had a safe place figured out for that night he beat her that she could have gone to if she needed to. But then later she says that she feels completely safe with him. If you have to even think of a safe place - you do not feel safe.   


So my question is -- what do I do in this situation? 

Does anyone know of an organization that I can connect my sister with so she can get some professional advice? I think she would be open speaking with a therapist, maybe.

"Please give me advice, I honestly don't know to do.","
The person in question isn't my ex rather than my sisters and the father of my nieces. Over the 11 years he's caused my family a  ton of trauma. 

*This is a long one. 
Back in 2012-2014 my sister would have horrible anxiety and panic attacks to the point she would have to go to the hospital. During that time he would slowly become an alcoholic and cheat on her with minors.
He was 21 and the girls were between 15-17, he was wasted when he told her. He also raped my sister which caused her to become pregnant. (It was nonconsensual she had no choice but to have sex with him because he was wasted and she didn't want him to snap) 
He also once walked in on me while I was in the shower when I was 13ish but everyone seemed to forget.

During those years I was in and out of the hospital with her, keep in mind I was absolutely depressed and suicidal. 
I once had to fight him off because he trying to take my niece while he was drunk. 

In 2017 they had a big fight (We all live together to save money)
he was also hooked on cocaine. He was trying to take my youngest niece which was 3 at the time. As I was running down the stairs carrying her while he was chasing me to get to the other room to call the cops. I slipped on the last few step, the baby was safe since I was fast enough to prop her standing up. Me on the other hand wasnt I had a sprained ankle. 
He accused me of throwing MY NIECE to get back at him when HE was chasing me.

In 2018, he was so out of it. Me and my mother had left to mexico to visit my grandmother since she was dying. My dad couldn't go since he had a stroke shortly after the 2017 incident. My sister kicked him out and he would sit outside for about an hour being absolute lunatic.

2019 was the final straw.
My sister went out after work and he completely lost his shit. Banging on my door asking for her. I had no idea where she was because she didn't tell she was going out.
The next few months were one of the most traumitizing moments of my life. I believe I got ptsd. 

He retaliated by crashing their car, threatening to kill her and take the girls from her. 
Then he got a restraining order placed for a year (Sister, nieces, me etc), can't be near our house or anyone within 100yrds. He gets to see his kids every sunday but my sister usually trails along because she loves him. 
A whole bunch of stuff happened from october - december he supposedly got clean so no coke or alcohol. 

Now 2020: 
He moved to an area nearby and got kicked out twice, then he moved again to napa (If you have can find any articles for an armed robbery in the contra costa or napa area please send it me! I believe it was 4 people) He and his friends robbed somewhere and they split the cash unevenly and he got jumped by them. 

Now in may he moved literally 4 blocks away and he has a gun illegally. My sister talks to him everyday, he drinks again and he's verbally abusive towards my nieces. The older one told me he constantly yells at them for no reason. My niece told me that she fears for her and her sisters life and she doesn't want her life to go back to what it once was. She said that their mom just sits their pretending as if nothing is wrong. My sister doesn't want to give me a copy of the restraining order.
She's in denial that it's abuse, if you have any articles that I can send to her to prove her wrong. PLEASE send them to me. 

If anyone has any information on what I can do (I'm in california), to help my nieces let me know. I'm currently 21 and unemployed, I don't know if there's much I can do. 

I can't type every single thing that has happened throughout the years.",domesticviolence
"I Finally Escaped, Again","I feel stupid for going back to my ex, but I had nowhere to go during the Coronavirus Quarantine. I spent 3 months at his house and it was great in the beginning. He was so nice, always complimenting me, spending time with me, doing things for me, etc. towards the end though, things got bad again. He started using drugs, being emotionally and physically abusive, and forcing me to do everything around the house. Any money I had would be taken away from me to support his drug habit. He stopped being interested in me and wouldn’t spend any time with me. I felt so alone and the fact that I couldn’t go anywhere made things so much worse. It finally came to a head when he woke me up one morning demanding money. Somehow he had figured out that a friend from Guam had sent me $50 to renew my I.D. He must have unlocked my phone while I was sleeping with my fingerprint and gone through my messages. I could tell that he was sick from not having his drugs and I refused to go get the money for him. He proceeded to beat me all over and pull me out of the bed by my hair. I screamed for help and after kicking me in my abdomen a few times he left me alone. I managed to pull myself up and lock the bedroom door before he came back and hurt me some more. I was genuinely afraid that he was going to kill me (I’m very petite and he is very big, 6ft.10 and 300 lbs.) I was laying on the bed trying to recover from the beating when I heard a knock on the door and a voice saying “Police! Open up!” He had actually called the cops on me! When I opened the door I was grateful to see an officer who had helped me in the past and knew that my ex had a history of abuse and a problem with drugs. As I was leaving with the officer I passed out. He had to call an ambulance and I was taken to the hospital where I was admitted and kept for observation for that day and night. During the attack, he had given me a concussion, a black eye, and caused bruising to my kidneys. 

Once the doctor determined that I was ok to be released, they realized that I had nowhere to go. They contacted the local domestic violence shelter where I had stayed before and they were full. I ended up at the city homeless shelter, where I had been attacked before. That shelter is full of drugs and violence, in fact, the police were called that night for a fight involving 5 men, one of which ended up in the hospital in critical condition. After a sleepless night on a hard cot, I spent the day at social services trying to find a place to stay. I was still in my pajamas and slippers from the morning I left. Thankfully the shelter placed me in a hotel room. I have been moved from hotel to hotel since then and have slowly been trying to get my life back. It’s difficult but at least I am away from him and safe. I’m having weekly visitation with my daughter again now that we don’t have to quarantine anymore!",domesticviolence

I feel bad for dobbing him in...,"Hi all,

So today I got so upset that I called the police to see how they could help me.
My (30F) partner (30M) has been yelling at my kids and I in a really threatening and scary manner to the point that I never feel 100% safe at home... and I never want to leave the kids alone with him...

Well today the police told me it sounds like I need a restraining order put in place and they will come and get him on Friday to serve him and to tell him to get out, that he can’t live here anymore etc...

I feel terrible... I love this man but he can’t treat me and my kids this way... but I am scared that the restraining order might be a bit of overkill but I just can’t think of any other way they could help me keep him away and out of my house etc...

I feel so guilty and like I am making a mountain out of a molehill because it’s not like he is hitting us etc..
I just don’t think I could break up with him safely without this?

WHAT DO I DO?

Try by myself and hop he is fine or do I go the police route???",domesticviolence
3ish months since I left him and it's better but still I live in fight or flight constantly,I left my abusive ex because of covid-19 and his increasing rate and severity of pyschological and emotional abuse. I knew I had to break up with him when I thought he was gonna kill me and I was screaming at him to get off me but he made things worse by forcefully shutting me up. I have been doing better but he decided to text me from a fake app number because he thought I blocked his number but I haven't yet in case he decides to try contact me like he did again and I need to get a restraining order if he gets threating again.  I had to move in with other people because I don't want him knowing where I live and had to leave a job because I had severe attacks daily that were triggered thinking he might show up because he knew where I worked. I feel like maybe I don't get to be so fucked up from him because people have been through worse and deal better than I do. I just don't want to think anymore that everyone in my life is a threat. I know my childhood made me go on to pick a piece of shit like him as a partner because my needs were far from met and yay me I found a guy who will help with everything. Turns out he did that for awhile and that's because I did whatever he asked but then he stopped helping me altogether and just turned very abusive. I don't want to feel sorry for myself anymore. I don't want pity. I just wish we didn't live in such a shitty world that vulnerable adults like me aren't given more support and love and looked after better then they are.,domesticviolence
Abuser has found a new victim. What to do?,"My longterm girlfriend escaped an abusive marriage. Restraining orders, and all. 

We have since moved on to a city pretty far away, and are finally feeling safe 3 years later.  I personally check up on her abuser (carefully and only through social media) to make sure he isnt up to any schemes that could put us in danger.

I recently discovered he is engaged again. He gets engaged very fast after dating, and its through all sorts of coercion and manipulation that he got my girfriend to submit to his request that got her trapped. They have a wedding website set up for a wedding that will take place in 2021. Every bit of evidence screams she is about to experience the same dangerous situation. Though he did show signs of being an abuser early on, the guy flipped a serious switch after the marriage.

On one hand, I feel relieved that my girlfriend may be ultimately safe from a very unstable man who would obsess over her if he were not moving on.  But I just cant help feeling like I am the only one who knows what will happen to this poor woman (My girflriend doesnt know of the engagement) .  


I have 2 tough questions:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Do I tell my girlfriend that he has recently gotten engaged, in hopes that she will feel safer and her anxiety and trauma decrease? Or is it just better to not bring this up and pretend like I know nothing?  


2) Is there anything I can do or should do to help the woman recently engaged to him, who will no doubt have her life ruined, if not completely eliminated by this violent and manipulative man?  Or do I need to move on myself, let it be, in order to not endanger my own girlfriend?  


Really struggling here.",domesticviolence
"My abusive ex showed up at my work, but I think it was a coincidence. How to talk to my manager?",[deleted],domesticviolence
Why is it so difficult to see it as abusive?,"I dont know if I need validation or what. The other day we were talking and I got up to go inside because I was getting annoyed and he grabbed my wrist until I sat back down. When we both went inside I told him that he can't do stuff like that to me and he said that he could do whatever he wants and grabbed me by my hair and kept saying, ""Do you understand?"" Wouldn't let go until I said yes. This isn't the first time he's grabbed me by my hair when I've told him he can't do something to me and wouldn't let go until I repeated what he wanted me to say. 


When I confront him that this is abusive he says it's just a joke and he isn't serious and he's just playing around with me. Then he apologized and said he didn't realize it felt abusive or felt ""real"" to me and he wouldn't play around with me like that or act so rough with me. Today he's been nothing but sweet and kind. When I read back what I wrote I know it sounds bad and if someone told me their husband did this to them I'd be shocked and tell them how wrong it was. So why am I always questioning and second guessing myself and wondering if I'm overreacting?",domesticviolence
Trouble understanding the language to use to describe abuse.,"I [30F] had a tough childhood. I consider my dad to be an emotionally abusive man, but it was not his fault. I forgave him long ago and have a lot of empathy now. When I was a junior in high school I had 0 self esteem and severe anxiety because of my dad. It was then that I met my ex fiancee (let's call him Chad).

Chad was charming at first. We were happy. I was head over heels for him until we went to college. Then he started to withdraw. He wouldn't visit me (I went to a school about 2 hours from him). He was emotionally unavailable. I was a freshman. I had no self esteem. I was lost. I transferred to be with him (it was a much better school and I have no regrets for other reasons). The relationship took an even more toxic turn. He would pressure me to have sex with other women (I am bisexual but am not so into the multiple partners at the same time thing). He would pressure me into threesomes. He was a habitual cheater. He was constantly encouraging me to fuck other people I didn't want to fuck so he could feel better about doing it behind my back. All the while he reminded me constantly how worthless I was, and how lucky I was he loved me because no one else ever would. There was at least one night when he pressured me I to sex I absolutely did not want, and I cried a lot after.

Then we got engaged and moved. He graduated college late and wanted to go to law school. He moved to be with me and contributed 0 to the household. I had 3 jobs for a while to keep us afloat while he played go on the internet. He refused to take me on dates. He was terrible with money and wouldn't let me spend anything myself, but would buy gadgets often. He refused to get a job. But still I was lucky to have him. 

He started to pressure me to have sex with my girlfriends, either alone or in front of him. He would find other women and pressure me into sleeping with them. I contracted an STD from one of these encounters. He went on dates with other women and told me about them. He tried to fuck my friends. He had a mistress who was a friend's ex (this happened a lot) who he fucked for years. He didn't try to hide it. He often told me how much better she was than me. He started law school, did terribly at it, and reminded me constantly that I was the reason he was failing.

He wanted me to be something sexually that I wasn't. He would dress me up in BDSM lingerie and clothes. He would complain I wasn't sexy enough or didn't meet his needs. He told me what to wear. He constantly demeaned my looks or clothing choices. By the end he was telling me to wear sexual clothes that made me uncomfortable.

I should have left, but he told me that I promised to love him unconditionally. I though no one would want me. That I was disgusting. I stayed for 10 years. I believed I was worthless. I only got out because I developed a crush that let me see things more clearly (he did not like me back). 

Now I'm married to a great guy but I feel cut off from him and totally numb. We made some unrelated mistakes. He was selfish early on and steamrolled me. I didn't have a voice. He NEVER would do anything to hurt me. But I feel so numb.

Can anyone help me describe what my ex was and did? He never hit me, so I never understood what was happening as abuse.  Everything I try to use to talk about it feels wrong. I feel like if I name it I can start dealing with it. Also any resources for healing would be greatly appreciated.",domesticviolence
Hello. I need some help.,Hello. I need some help. My best friend is in a really bad domestic violence relationship. She is codependent and suffering. We stopped talking after her first son was born because she started being rude and I decided I didn't need that in my life but started talking a year ago. Something told my gut to get ahold of her and sure enough my gut was right. I don't need to tell everything but I can say that he has tied to kill her and he was arrested and bailed out the next day by his parents. She didn't get the proper help she needed by the victims advocate and lied about that happened even though she had hand marks around her neck. He has said he was going to kill her and her 2 kids several times. So one time she I didn't hear from her for a month and I begged her to just tell me she was ok that's all I needed to know. She agreed and said sorry. So I fucked up I got upset another month went by I left her text messages voice mail and nothing back. I got upset because I been working so hard to help her and get her help I fucked up and sent her some messages I regret nothing mean just how my feelings are hurt and I love her and always are there for her and all I asked for her is to tell me she was alright. She was getting on Instagram and sharing videos so why couldn't she just send a small response. Before we talked almost 5 times a week. Now she is not responding I haven't heard anything. I have called left voicemail again I have begged her to talk to me. I have been working with a victims advocate to get help to help her. She hasn't posted anything no activity in 2 weeks. What should I do stop trying to get ahold of her let it go. Call for a wellness check. Contact her brother tell him what's going on. Btw she hasn't told anyone what's really going on she was a foster child and doesn't have parents or a supportive family just her brother she talks to. The husband family is in denial and blames both of them for the so called drama and doesn't realize she is in deep danger. I had been working with a detective about 6 months ago to get enough evidence to charge him with attempted murder and we had everything but her statement that's all he needed. but he does tell her all the time how he's going to kill her and the kids drive off a cliff drive into the barrier he's going to kill himself he's already shot a gun in the house with the kids. I'm so scared I don't know what to do.,domesticviolence

Leaving Codependent Abusive Relationship. Me (29M) - He (33M),"Hi Guys, 

First thank you for this subreddit and for taking the time to read this; I'll try to keep it short as possible. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was with my partner (we were engaged) for 4 /12 years.  It was a match made in heaven in my eyes and in some twisted way I still see it that way.  We both work in the same industry as freelancers, have many of the same likes and way of living.  The big difference was his drinking was a huge problem.  Everytime he would get drunk he would either hit me or verbally drag me through the mud and call me a spic, good for nothing artist that wouldn't be anyone in this world without him.  He would insult my family and friends and say he was the only one who understood me.  He would never remember the fights or his actions.  His apologizes half ass because he did constantly.  2 years into the relationship our sex life was basically once every six months, I proposed an open relationship because I figured he might want to be with other men, I was fine with it because it's just sex not love.  But what bothered me is that he never wanted to have sex with me, I always begged and was shut down.  Even acts of affection like kissing he would reject me.  All while he drank and would get mean.  He would get jealous if I hung out with friends. Kept tabs on me.  August of 2019 we had a vacation and it was great until the end when he got drunk at his family wedding and hit me in the face with flowers leaving scratches on my face.  When we got back to NYC where we live every month he would be more cruel in his drinking and I would do everything in my power to strengthen the relationship by doing evening walks, figure drawing classes of each other during dinner, biking, upstate hikes for the day and etc.   He would fight me on all of them and say he never had time or was too busy.  I understood his career was taking off and mine was too so we threw ourselves into our work but I knew what was at stake.  

&amp;#x200B;

In January of 2020 I began running and working out to shed some weight so he can find me attractive.  But in those workouts which I haven't done in awhile because he didn't like when I worked out because he didn't know where I was, I began to reclaim my old self before I met him and realized what an abusive asshole he is to me.   He perfectly can tear me down and build me up and I allowed it because I was and still am in love with him.  Because I see him as a human who deserves respect he sees me as a stuffed animal he can do what he pleases with and have no consequences to his actions. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the beginning of Feb he came back from a work trip and lost his mind when he got home because I didn't wash the dishes (there were 3 plates and 2 cups) and I didn't make the bed properly.  He started throwing things around the house and this was the first time I ever saw him lose his cool sober and I got so scared I left the apartment and so did he.  I came back and he wasn't home and I packed my things so quickly and left to stay at a hotel for 7 days near the apartment.  I told him I needed space to understand why he thinks it's okay to treat me like this.  He said me leaving was a break up and told me some of the worst things I have ever heard in my life.  I cried and just wanted to run into his arms nonetheless.

&amp;#x200B;

I went to therapy and was told abusive relationships are difficult to get out of and not to be hard on myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then covid happen.  5 months apart, me in long island and he spent it in virginia.

Within those 5 months we spoke and talked about the relationship and how he is sorry for everything he ever did and regrets not doing the simple things with me to enjoy life.   I was so excited and hopeful he was showing signs of accountability and wanting to do the work.   I knew he was seeing guys over there because his libido came back and I was fine with it.  He came back last week and told me he was coming for work and to work on our relationship.  Only for me to find out he was spending the time in the apartment we built and I made home with the guy from virginia.   I know we aren't together but I just wish he didn't fuck with my head like this! I wish he didn't disrespect me and give me hope.  If he found someone else he should have told me.  Not left me with the impression he wanted to salvage things and bring his lover.  

He is doing things with him that i asked, walks at the end of the day, drawing each other during dinner, and being kind to him, not drinking as much.  

&amp;#x200B;

When i called him out on it he said that the guy is nothing to him but he succeed in making me jealous.  That the guy is an experiment on how to love me properly.  I knew he was lying because we met face to face yesterday and he told me he was torn because he loves him.

&amp;#x200B;

I made the choice yesterday after he left, after I fought with him because I asked him to stay longer with me and he said he had plans with the guy.  I made the choice for him that he couldn't.  I left officially and blocked him.  

&amp;#x200B;

I gave him almost 5 years of my life for him to throw it away in 7 days because he couldn't wait to see me and wanted to flaunt in my face that someone else wanted him..... I feel crazy because I know he is sick in the head, but I love him and wish it was us not them together.  

&amp;#x200B;

This will be a long journey of recovery.  Im scared and lonely but I can live with myself knowing I showed my love through actions and words to show someone I really loved them.

Antidepressants after abuse?,"Hi all,

I’ve been out 9 months. The last 3 have been extremely hard and I am curious to know others experiences with psyc meds after abuse. 

I’ve never taken antidepressants. I do have some troubling substances abuse issues (alcohol, Xanax, ketamine), albeit mostly under control, it has affected my ability to function in the past and very recently.

I’ve been with a great therapist for over a year, and while she was instrumental in getting me out of physical harms way, I’m still struggling very much with the trauma, missing him terribly, still very stuck under his control, unable to move on with my love life, obsessing over what he thinks or says of me. He threatened me into having an abortion I didn’t want and raped me very early on in the relationship.. these were the 2 major injuries to me that still hurt me daily.

It’s been no contact for 9 months, I have no clue of anyway to reach him or where he is living now.

On the surface I know that I am doing alright considering, my people are proud of me, but inside it is a different story. 

Sorry for the length, just want to be understood. Please share how meds have and have not helped you through your stories.

Domestic Violence - how to navigate this when your loved one is a victim?,"Hello - I'm seeking out advice/support. I'm not sure how to approach and navigate the current situation that is happening with my sister and her fiance. Please share what you would do in this situation. I'm seeking legal advice and emotional advice. Even personal advice/experiences. A different perspective maybe. I'm just trying to figure out how to navigate this situation.  I want to be there for my sister but I want to do what's right as well.   


Situation:   


My mom basically gave my sister a guilt trip today because she never goes to visit them. My sister didn't visit them at all during the holidays last year. No visit for either of their birthdays or Mother's Day. Even though they live only 20 minutes away. My parent's never see her.  So in retaliation to that - my sister contacted my mother today and sent her a picture and told her that the dresser fell on her and that's why she wasn't coming to visit for Father's Day. The picture she sent was of her face. In the picture she has a huge busted up lip, swollen nose and looks like she will have two black eyes soon. After some interrogation from my mothers end (because my mom didn't just fall off a turnip truck- she knew that wasn't from a dresser) - my sister admitted that it was her fiance that did it. They have been living together for several years. Maybe 8 years or so.   


Her (my sister) current stance on the situation is that she is fine. She does not want to leave him.  She does not want the police involved. He is ""not that kind of man"". He feels bad. He's been saying he needs counseling like he's had in the past. His temper just got away from him. Sometimes he sees red. He asked her to call the cops on him after it happened. He wanted her to go to my moms house for the night after it happened.  (These are all the excuses and things she has told me and/or my mother today.) She also said that there was not alcohol involved. It is hard to know what to believe from her though. She also let it slip to me that this ""hasn't happened in a long time"". So even though she told both of us it was the first time this has happened - that was a lie. 

&amp;#x200B;

Full Picture/Background info:   


Some background information about my sister. She is a recovering alcoholic, maybe active (not sure). 34 years old. She has no children. She was married for about 18 months in her early 20s then divorced. She started drinking in her early 20's and went downhill from there. She's always had social anxiety. ""Chip on her shoulder"" persona throughout her entire lifetime. She has a few DUI's from her really bad days of alcoholism. She's been in in-patient rehab facilities. She's told me that she's also a sex addict. She is also bulimic. She's told us she's been raped before. She used to go out a lot to bars and I think there is a lot of things that have happened to her that we don't even know about. A lot of legal things with her life she won't tell us. She bottles things up a lot. I'm not sure if there are any other drugs involved in her life or her fiances life. I know they smoke cannabis sometimes. And I think she is still drinking. She was talking with an online therapist on talkspace off and on within the last few years but she doesn't do that anymore. Her and my mom butt heads a lot because my mom tells her how it is all the time. Last time things were bad with my sister - it stressed my mom out so much that my mother swallowed a whole bottle of pills and was rushed to the hospital to have her stomach pumped. So my mom can't handle this new situation that has now arose. My mom's psychiatrist (from the last drama time) told her she had to distance herself from her daughter, (my sister). And that is now what my mom will try to do again. She won't be able to handle seeing Robyn stay together with an abusive partner. My dad is kind of like me. He's upset about it but doesn't know what to do.   


The ""fiance"" (man that beat up my sister Friday night) has a ""car salesman"" type of personality. He always drives her around when she needs to go somewhere. He's always the one talking when they are together. Robyn is never around my parents or myself without him there. It's almost like she's using him as a crutch. At least this is what I thought of their relationship in the early days. He isn't someone I ever imagined my sister being with. But my sister has changed so much since we were kids. SHe's not the same person anymore. She hasn't been the same since she started heavily drinking in her early 20's. They live in the middle of nowhere Oklahoma. I don't know a whole lot about him. He is the type that will lie and spin the truth. He grew up in a different small town in Oklahoma. He is around 33 years old and has 2 daughters of his own. Both of them with a different woman other than my sister. My sister actually works with his mom at a laundry mat. And even though they are only 20 minute drive from my parents. My sister never goes to visit my parents. (I personally live in Florida. I've been living here since February. Before that, I lived in Germany for 5 years preceding. So I've been physically very far away from all of this.) I flew to Oklahoma just last week to visit them all. I hadn't seen my parents and my sister in almost 2 years. I just moved back to the states from Germany. Now I'm able to visit my parents and sister much easier and quicker. I swear last week when I hugged my sister for the first time in almost 2 years, that I could smell alcohol. If you know someone that is an alcoholic - you know that smell that the skin and pores releases. 

&amp;#x200B;

What to do now?   


So when we first got the real truth about what happened. Of course my mom and dad were ready to get a gun and go after him. Then the next thought was -  to call the police.   
But then we have my sister asking us not to tell anyone, asking us not post anything, asking us not to call the police or to call her fiance. (Which she called her boyfriend today-- which I noticed that she didn't refer to him as her fiance like usual.) We have evidence on our phone of what her face looks like. And her admission to what happened. She was careful not to give too many details about what happened too. She said she didn't want us reporting him so she didn't want to tell us. I did get from her that it happened Friday night and that it was him that did that to her face. And that it was because of stress from money and he ""exploded"".  I tried to convince her to leave him. To move in with me. But, she didn't want any of that. My mom told her she was buying her a ticket to fly her to Florida to stay with me. She didn't want that. Didn't want to talk about it.  She's been saying she's fine. And it's not a big deal. She's asked me not to think about it. She's been saying contradicting things to me all day. For example she said he ""barely drinks"". Then she states later that he doesn't drink at all. Then also she stated that she had a safe place figured out for that night he beat her that she could have gone to if she needed to. But then later she says that she feels completely safe with him. If you have to even think of a safe place - you do not feel safe.   


So my question is -- what do I do in this situation? 

Does anyone know of an organization that I can connect my sister with so she can get some professional advice? I think she would be open speaking with a therapist, maybe.

"Please give me advice, I honestly don't know to do.","
The person in question isn't my ex rather than my sisters and the father of my nieces. Over the 11 years he's caused my family a  ton of trauma. 

*This is a long one. 
Back in 2012-2014 my sister would have horrible anxiety and panic attacks to the point she would have to go to the hospital. During that time he would slowly become an alcoholic and cheat on her with minors.
He was 21 and the girls were between 15-17, he was wasted when he told her. He also raped my sister which caused her to become pregnant. (It was nonconsensual she had no choice but to have sex with him because he was wasted and she didn't want him to snap) 
He also once walked in on me while I was in the shower when I was 13ish but everyone seemed to forget.

During those years I was in and out of the hospital with her, keep in mind I was absolutely depressed and suicidal. 
I once had to fight him off because he trying to take my niece while he was drunk. 

In 2017 they had a big fight (We all live together to save money)
he was also hooked on cocaine. He was trying to take my youngest niece which was 3 at the time. As I was running down the stairs carrying her while he was chasing me to get to the other room to call the cops. I slipped on the last few step, the baby was safe since I was fast enough to prop her standing up. Me on the other hand wasnt I had a sprained ankle. 
He accused me of throwing MY NIECE to get back at him when HE was chasing me.

In 2018, he was so out of it. Me and my mother had left to mexico to visit my grandmother since she was dying. My dad couldn't go since he had a stroke shortly after the 2017 incident. My sister kicked him out and he would sit outside for about an hour being absolute lunatic.

2019 was the final straw.
My sister went out after work and he completely lost his shit. Banging on my door asking for her. I had no idea where she was because she didn't tell she was going out.
The next few months were one of the most traumitizing moments of my life. I believe I got ptsd. 

He retaliated by crashing their car, threatening to kill her and take the girls from her. 
Then he got a restraining order placed for a year (Sister, nieces, me etc), can't be near our house or anyone within 100yrds. He gets to see his kids every sunday but my sister usually trails along because she loves him. 
A whole bunch of stuff happened from october - december he supposedly got clean so no coke or alcohol. 

Now 2020: 
He moved to an area nearby and got kicked out twice, then he moved again to napa (If you have can find any articles for an armed robbery in the contra costa or napa area please send it me! I believe it was 4 people) He and his friends robbed somewhere and they split the cash unevenly and he got jumped by them. 

Now in may he moved literally 4 blocks away and he has a gun illegally. My sister talks to him everyday, he drinks again and he's verbally abusive towards my nieces. The older one told me he constantly yells at them for no reason. My niece told me that she fears for her and her sisters life and she doesn't want her life to go back to what it once was. She said that their mom just sits their pretending as if nothing is wrong. My sister doesn't want to give me a copy of the restraining order.
She's in denial that it's abuse, if you have any articles that I can send to her to prove her wrong. PLEASE send them to me. 

If anyone has any information on what I can do (I'm in california), to help my nieces let me know. I'm currently 21 and unemployed, I don't know if there's much I can do. 

I can't type every single thing that has happened throughout the years.",domesticviolence
"I Finally Escaped, Again","I feel stupid for going back to my ex, but I had nowhere to go during the Coronavirus Quarantine. I spent 3 months at his house and it was great in the beginning. He was so nice, always complimenting me, spending time with me, doing things for me, etc. towards the end though, things got bad again. He started using drugs, being emotionally and physically abusive, and forcing me to do everything around the house. Any money I had would be taken away from me to support his drug habit. He stopped being interested in me and wouldn’t spend any time with me. I felt so alone and the fact that I couldn’t go anywhere made things so much worse. It finally came to a head when he woke me up one morning demanding money. Somehow he had figured out that a friend from Guam had sent me $50 to renew my I.D. He must have unlocked my phone while I was sleeping with my fingerprint and gone through my messages. I could tell that he was sick from not having his drugs and I refused to go get the money for him. He proceeded to beat me all over and pull me out of the bed by my hair. I screamed for help and after kicking me in my abdomen a few times he left me alone. I managed to pull myself up and lock the bedroom door before he came back and hurt me some more. I was genuinely afraid that he was going to kill me (I’m very petite and he is very big, 6ft.10 and 300 lbs.) I was laying on the bed trying to recover from the beating when I heard a knock on the door and a voice saying “Police! Open up!” He had actually called the cops on me! When I opened the door I was grateful to see an officer who had helped me in the past and knew that my ex had a history of abuse and a problem with drugs. As I was leaving with the officer I passed out. He had to call an ambulance and I was taken to the hospital where I was admitted and kept for observation for that day and night. During the attack, he had given me a concussion, a black eye, and caused bruising to my kidneys. 

Once the doctor determined that I was ok to be released, they realized that I had nowhere to go. They contacted the local domestic violence shelter where I had stayed before and they were full. I ended up at the city homeless shelter, where I had been attacked before. That shelter is full of drugs and violence, in fact, the police were called that night for a fight involving 5 men, one of which ended up in the hospital in critical condition. After a sleepless night on a hard cot, I spent the day at social services trying to find a place to stay. I was still in my pajamas and slippers from the morning I left. Thankfully the shelter placed me in a hotel room. I have been moved from hotel to hotel since then and have slowly been trying to get my life back. It’s difficult but at least I am away from him and safe. I’m having weekly visitation with my daughter again now that we don’t have to quarantine anymore!",domesticviolence

I feel bad for dobbing him in...,"Hi all,

So today I got so upset that I called the police to see how they could help me.
My (30F) partner (30M) has been yelling at my kids and I in a really threatening and scary manner to the point that I never feel 100% safe at home... and I never want to leave the kids alone with him...

Well today the police told me it sounds like I need a restraining order put in place and they will come and get him on Friday to serve him and to tell him to get out, that he can’t live here anymore etc...

I feel terrible... I love this man but he can’t treat me and my kids this way... but I am scared that the restraining order might be a bit of overkill but I just can’t think of any other way they could help me keep him away and out of my house etc...

I feel so guilty and like I am making a mountain out of a molehill because it’s not like he is hitting us etc..
I just don’t think I could break up with him safely without this?

WHAT DO I DO?

Try by myself and hop he is fine or do I go the police route???",domesticviolence
3ish months since I left him and it's better but still I live in fight or flight constantly,I left my abusive ex because of covid-19 and his increasing rate and severity of pyschological and emotional abuse. I knew I had to break up with him when I thought he was gonna kill me and I was screaming at him to get off me but he made things worse by forcefully shutting me up. I have been doing better but he decided to text me from a fake app number because he thought I blocked his number but I haven't yet in case he decides to try contact me like he did again and I need to get a restraining order if he gets threating again.  I had to move in with other people because I don't want him knowing where I live and had to leave a job because I had severe attacks daily that were triggered thinking he might show up because he knew where I worked. I feel like maybe I don't get to be so fucked up from him because people have been through worse and deal better than I do. I just don't want to think anymore that everyone in my life is a threat. I know my childhood made me go on to pick a piece of shit like him as a partner because my needs were far from met and yay me I found a guy who will help with everything. Turns out he did that for awhile and that's because I did whatever he asked but then he stopped helping me altogether and just turned very abusive. I don't want to feel sorry for myself anymore. I don't want pity. I just wish we didn't live in such a shitty world that vulnerable adults like me aren't given more support and love and looked after better then they are.,domesticviolence
Abuser has found a new victim. What to do?,"My longterm girlfriend escaped an abusive marriage. Restraining orders, and all. 

We have since moved on to a city pretty far away, and are finally feeling safe 3 years later.  I personally check up on her abuser (carefully and only through social media) to make sure he isnt up to any schemes that could put us in danger.

I recently discovered he is engaged again. He gets engaged very fast after dating, and its through all sorts of coercion and manipulation that he got my girfriend to submit to his request that got her trapped. They have a wedding website set up for a wedding that will take place in 2021. Every bit of evidence screams she is about to experience the same dangerous situation. Though he did show signs of being an abuser early on, the guy flipped a serious switch after the marriage.

On one hand, I feel relieved that my girlfriend may be ultimately safe from a very unstable man who would obsess over her if he were not moving on.  But I just cant help feeling like I am the only one who knows what will happen to this poor woman (My girflriend doesnt know of the engagement) .  


I have 2 tough questions:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Do I tell my girlfriend that he has recently gotten engaged, in hopes that she will feel safer and her anxiety and trauma decrease? Or is it just better to not bring this up and pretend like I know nothing?  


2) Is there anything I can do or should do to help the woman recently engaged to him, who will no doubt have her life ruined, if not completely eliminated by this violent and manipulative man?  Or do I need to move on myself, let it be, in order to not endanger my own girlfriend?

"My abusive ex showed up at my work, but I think it was a coincidence. How to talk to my manager?",[deleted],domesticviolence
Is this verbal or emotional abuse or am I overreacting?,"Not sure if what I'm experiencing could be verbal or emotional abuse? My husband tends to snap at me a lot. Not even in moments of stress, but in every day conversation, like harsh, aggressive tone, etc. In the past I've told him that it starts to affect my self-esteem and makes me wonder what's wrong with me and why can't he just speak to me nicely. For several months he was working on it and it stopped being a problem, but since the pandemic started he's started to do it again more often on a day to day basis. 


The last time it happened was last week. We were eating and he had to suddenly run into work and all I did was remind him of something related to his job he had told me about earlier. This led to him snapping at me that he already knew, etc. When he got home he apologized, but then got mad at me because I was still upset??? and said why can't he apologize and we just move on? It was hard for me to immediately move on because the snapping was happening every single day leading up to that incident. Like at that point it was the culmination of being snapped at day after day. He didn't get it at first but then he ended up apologizing again and explained he was stressed with work and took it out on me and was sorry. But then he added that I push him and he felt like I was ""challenging him"" when I said the work reminder, which is why he snapped at me. It feels like he started with an apology for his behavior but then put the blame on me? He said he would continue to work on it and since last week we haven't had any issues but idk. I wasn't trying to push him or challenge him and just wanted to remind him of something. I just dont get what I did that was so wrong? Any advice helps. I did kind of confront him that it feels kind of abusive sometimes when this happens and he started asking, ""Do you really think I'm an abuser?"" and saying how hurt he was that I'd even say that and then I felt guilty for thinking that.",domesticviolence
Im stupid. How long to feel better after minor strangulation?,"Maybe this doesnt belong here Im not sure where to label this since Im kinda confused.   


I have to spill my sin and I think it might qualify as some level of borderline abuse and could really use some advice. Its a graphic story of what just happened though so please don't read if your sensitive.   
My overall question though if you don't want to read id how long does it take you to feel better after ""minor"" strangulation?

&amp;#x200B;

I feel way to embarassed to go to my Dr about this and Im a hypochondriac so maybe Im thinking to much on it.

&amp;#x200B;

Im 29, really fat and partially blind so I don't get out much. I have a pretty face but not much else. I have no friends and my idea of a wet dream is when dream men hold my hand. My family has been belittling me about being almost 30 with no friends, boyfriend or life pretty much since my birthday. Though I just finally graduated college with my BA.🤷🏻‍♀️

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway an ex hit me up the other day. Like the last guy I ever dated eight years ago. He was a charming douche but I still kinda had fun with him and he was the first guy I had more than one consensual sexual encounter with at 22. Even though Iv never really liked it and he would always say ""your welcome"" after like ge did me the favor so I dumped him.

&amp;#x200B;

But yesterday I was desperate and dumb and here was some rare attention so I cleaned up my apartment, got as nice looking as I could and he came over saying he would only stay for like a half hour and talk and stuff cuz I told him I might not feel the best. But I really liked the feeling of being hugged and cuddled. Its not something   
I ever get to feel and he knows how pathetic I am so I know he used that to charm me. And so my dumb brain turned off and I gave in to his advances. I thought this time I would be assertive and a strong women and try not to care about my fat body while he had a nice one. Plus I had ovarian surgery last year and haven't been able to reach orgasm since (though never had issues before blah) and thought I would try once with a person instead of myself to see if it could fix me.   
It was ok at first. Though he is kinda on the small penis end he is a huge guy. Back in the day he always begged me for blow jobs and I never gave in because I told him it reminded me of bad stuff I went through as a kid and grosses me out. But 29 year old me has been through therapy and wanted to be confident so I did it and that's when I noticed he wasn't simply douchy like long ago he started saying a lot of degrading things to me and forcing my arms and head to do things even when I tried to pull away. Then when he tried normal way out of nowhere he started strangling me. Im 5ft2 and he is 6ft3 with large hands and it shocked me a lot. I started struggling and he just squeezed harder. I never passed out and could kinda breath tiny kinda trying to kick him off. but my veins felt really restricted. He's really strong so I could not move his hands. But he let up and I was too shocked to say anything but then he kept randomly doing it off and on. I am not sure if I froze and thats why I didnt have the courage to end it there. But I am a people pleaser I guess and he had driven far so I felt bad and didn't want to disappoint him or irritate him. At that point I just was screaming in my head for it to end and starting thinking of scape options like how to make him happy so it will stop in my head but I still pretended to enjoy it a little and pretended everything was fine and pretended to be the confident woman like I had read about trying to be. And then he put a pillow over my head and was preasing down on my mouth area. When I freed my mouth gasping for air he fought me to keep it on and kept trying to stop me breathing and it took me a couple minutes to get it away. Or felt that way. Then he acted like he was all nice and tried touching me and holding me down so I pretended to like it so it would be over faster. But it wasn't and he forced my head to do other things that were a lot more painful and degrading than the how to articals described. I did managed a loud awkward no with one disgusting unforgivable reqest and keep my head away despite the yanking till he moved on. So I was kinda panicking now inside but still trying to make him happy so he would finish and leave. Heck I even smiled and laughed awkwardly trying to talk about things when I got the chance to breath freely but he kept telling me to shut up. Though I know he knew he was hurting me at times because when I couldn't hold the fake enjoyment it made him happier and he strangled me a few more times randomly even though I was clawing and kicking at him. By the end I just did what he wanted plastered a fake smile on my face because if he would just be done it would stop. At least that was my thinking. When it was over, after he said he would just finish ""on me"" but then forced it in my mouth to do it there, nasty grossest crap, and made a few more rude remarks it was over. Throughout it he also pretended the condom fell off and kept going though I told him there was another and seemed to mumble something about being pregnant already idk. Hopefully my dud ovary and blocked tube does its job. He also slapped my body several times throughout. He was all pleased with himself and I just kinda obvious fake laughed it off awkwardly kinda but thinking back I was in a scared disgusted daze at the same time. And then he just left trying to be charming and give me a hug and mumbled something about next time and I got kinda mad finally and said ""next time? il be hurting you"" he laughed and I pushed him out the door. I also said ""Your Welcome"" as I shut it just as a throwback. So my self confidence apparently only kickes in when I don't have a giant sergeant holding me down of course ugh.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like a damn fool for even thinking of trusting anyone to touch me. And I feel like an even bigger fool for being so nice as to not be able to stick up for myself when I wanted to escape. I have a hard time believing he thought 100% I was actually enjoying myself by the way he would look and treat me. But he is such a strong tall military guy and I'm short fat and weak so I could not actually stop him from doing these things. But if I said no go away he probably would have if not sulking like when we were young. But than if he could act this differently than before maybe not? I knew he would be a douche but I felt kinda helpess and hurt though I could have stoped it idk. Should have. I was like a man handled ragdoll. And he knew for a fact I was not into bdsm type stuff cuz right before we were talking about movies scrolling by on netflix and he mentioned the 50 Shades movie and I said it was dumb and would never do that stuff..

But its not like he assaulted me though cuz I consented. I didn't consent to the bad stuff but I couldn't say no either though and I tried and did start kicking and making like ""stop noises"". Which he ignored and made it worse.

&amp;#x200B;

Lost story short my throat and neck hurt and I feel like a disgusting piece if slutty meat now when yesterday I felt like a happy content nun watching my cartoons with my cat.   


I feel violated and hurt. But I smiled and let him continue so it could be over faster. Plus I didn't wana make him mad or sonething. Not that I was afraid he'd hit me just I hate disappointing people. But maybe I should have been afraid and I am really disapointed in myself.

&amp;#x200B;

Today my neck feels tight kind of. I thought my anxiety was just making it feel that way. And sore throat is a given. But I just did a short workout and I can feel the blood pulse and rush through my neck and its really unerving and I hate it and now my neck feels like its still being strangled a little but I have no bruise. Can breathe fine despite soreness in my throat. But the internet said people can drop dead days after even a little bit of that. Im scared. Id rather die than humiliate myself with going to the doctor and explaining it and since I cant drive Id have to explain to my master at belittling me sister to get there. But has anyone else felt this? Will it get better? Its just still fresh and maybe a little bruised inside? Google is giving me visions of my blood vessels snapping, strokes or esophagus being partially crushed without realizing it. Though   
I'm eating fine Id rather not randomly die in a few days. The sensation is just bothering me mentally bad.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice?

&amp;#x200B;

For the record Im just going to stick to dream men for the rest of my life. Im not someone who trusts easily and now I realize its not worth even involving myself with anyone. Even more so when Im broken sexually and cant feel stuff anyway. I literally just did it as an experiment and to make him happy so I could get some hugs from a human being. I feel so gross now like my body and mouth are contaminated and I should not touch anything, eat food, or kiss even my cats or family now like I will spread the nastiness of what I did to things I love.

I feel stupid for posting this,"I'm a 34 year old guy who lost his job to covid, living with parents who are emotionally and mentally abusing me. The threat of physical violence is certainly a spectre, but fortunately they have only hit me once since I was a teenager.

Like the title suggests, I know that I'm in a position of privilege compared to many others out there, but this really sucks.

I spend 20 hours in 'my room' per day because they are so miserable to be around. If I go to the kitchen to eat I get harassed for example. That is the absolute lightest of examples. Sometimes they fight and hit each other. When they fight they use any excuse to hide what they did, or they tell me that it was my fault.

I pretty much have no social interactions besides going to the grocery store.

I don't have the financial means to move out. I've got a spazzy dog, and I'm in a mid sized Northwest city where housing costs are absolutely ridiculous even without pet deposits. I've considered giving the dog away, but that is a heartbreaking thought when you have nothing and no friends.

I don't know what to do.",domesticviolence
Vent but advice/knowledge is appreciated. My best friend is suffering DV with her partner.,"My main questions are at the bottom if you just wanna skim. 
I'll try not to make this longer than it needs to be. 
My best friend (20 f) is in an abusive relationship &amp; its getting worse, they've been together for three years &amp; it's all abuse expect for sexual (that I'm aware of). She already has a lot going on with uni &amp; trying to improve her mental health, I don't want her to stay in this relationship while it just gets worse &amp; worse &amp; by the time she leaves.. If she does... She has even more, harder, stuff to work on.
The problem is, I'm a teenager &amp; I also live in a different state to her. She's come to stay with me before when things were bad but that was only for a week so she could have a “break“.
As you can tell, I'm a bit helpless.
I've offered to her for her to come live with me &amp; my family permanently as my family has been thru domestic violence &amp; we have given people a place to stay many times. My offer wasn't long ago &amp; I told her i/we could help her move up her around January time so she could have time to change unis &amp; settle in, that stuff. She just seems really reluctant to really take on help or even help herself as harsh as that sounds because she is so used to living in a DV situation (she moved in with her bfs family almost two years ago to get away from her families abuse) &amp; she also has bpd which makes leaving very hard to put it simple, if you have bpd is you get what I mean. Plus she has no friends or family there that she can go with. She only has me &amp; some of my friends up here.

I've spoken to my mum about it &amp; she told me I need to be straightforward with my friend which I have been because as we all know this is so serious &amp; dangerous &amp; friends have to be honest with eachother regardless. She told me I need to tell my friend to search for resources &amp; shelerts &amp; for her not to tell anyone (of course) &amp; reassure her that people will help her because of the situation she's in. I've told her this all. I've even given her resources to look into but she just won't take it. She's scared too &amp; I asked her how isn't she more scared to stay in this situation? He's only bringing her down &amp; he will only get worse. He's a manipulater &amp; he's gaslighting you. I said stuff like that in a caring way.she comes to me for support mostly &amp; I know that I can't “save“ her, she needs to save herself but it's honestly scary &amp; I don't want her to end up dead which is worst case situation. 

What can I do to help my friend? I know she has to want to help herself but what are some resources I can at least recommend to her (shelters, support groups, therapy centres ect) that might help her make the first step? She lives in West Melbourne Victoria AUS. what would you say if this was your friend to try to convince them? What would you do? Any knowledge/advice is welcomed.",domesticviolence
How can I help my friend?,"I have a friend who has been suffering abuse at the hands of her addict husband. She is scared to leave as he has told her if she attempts to he will kill the entire family (she has four kids). He has been tormenting the kids as well, physically and mentally. 

Recently she has started posting about things that have been happening as well as a couple of pictures of damage that he has done. 

I want to call the cops but I’m nervous if I call when he is sober they won’t do anything and he will retaliate. 

I’m currently on the other side of the country so I don’t know when he is sober and when he is drunk. Will the cops still do something if he is sober?",domesticviolence
"I caught my biggest worry on tape, can anybody actually help? (UK based)","I'm a 23 year old homeowner (female). I'm selling my house, the house I was abused in for over a year. I'm currently detaching from my partner and working on healing but occasionally he comes back (he moved back with his dad just 5 miles away), lets himself in, etc. I let it happen and try avoid conflict because I know that until the house is sold, because we're so close geographically, I'm not safe.

This man has no care for the law, does what he wants, thinks he's above the law and isn't bothered about facing the police, punishment, or even jail time. If I fully broke things off with him now he would definitely, 100%, destroy the house and make it unsellable (at least to the current buyer who has a mortgage) - or at the very least keep me here much longer and closer to him! He wants to control my life.

So I will sell, and run. I have a buyer so within a couple of months I should be outta here, woooo! That said, I'm a young entrepreneur and own my home outright. He did some renovation work when we moved in, maybe £2-4k worth. We were in a happy relationship at this time and never discussed payment. Legally, he's entitled to nothing.

That said, he expects 50% (around £50,000). I have a voice recording of him saying:

&gt;'whatever you get from here, half of that is going in my account, which is payment for building this fucking shithole, that's taken up 3 years of my life with you, you miserable fucking piece of shit. if you don't, I will dedicate the rest of my fucking life to killing you, you fucking asshole'.

I will be moving back to nearer my hometown, about 40 miles away, but it's just a short train ride away. How can I get help and protect myself? I only have unclear images of physical abuse (I think because I'm so pale the camera doesn't pick up well, and he's never left bruises or serious marks/cuts), the only thing I have as hard 'evidence' is the recording - so even if I tried to press charges the highest charge he'd get is common assault? Even then, for a common assault offence to have taken place, the threat must be immediate, so the charge would fail.

What am I supposed to do to ensure my safety? The police in the UK are awful at protecting people, and so many domestic abuse victims die \*after\* the relationship ended. What can be done?",domesticviolence
My partner (44M) has just been arrested for repeatedly punching me (23F) in the face and stealing my phone,"Title is self explanatory. To give you an idea of my partner, he had already been in prison twice for domestic violence previously and has spent approx 14 years in prison for a myriad of offences in total. 
 My first boyfriend, 21 years my senior and the first man who spontaneously opened up the capacity for romantic love for the opposite sex after a life time of sexual violence, has just been arrested for domestic violence; finally. 

He was the person who taught me what it meant to ‘light up a room’ through free expression of his effervescent charisma, whilst also being the person who made me walk on egg shells for fear he would permanently scar or kill me. 

He’s threatened to throw acid in my face, kill me in a multitude of ways (such as ‘stab/slice me up and leave me begging for mercy’), kick my head in on multiple occasions, arrange for people in my town 20 years older and in his 40-odd year old age bracket to beat me up. He’s called up the organisation who manages where I live and tried to intentionally make me homeless by telling them discriminatory and incriminating information about me. I’ve trusted him with information that I have never told anyone, running along the theme of childhood sexual abuse, just for him to turn around and use that information as golden ammunition to assassinate, blackmail me with, and threaten to post all over Facebook. 

He’s hyper possessive, jealous, and up until now only been emotionally and mentally abusive. He has had me genuinely believe I wasn’t worth shit and that I really was a fat, useless whore who no one else would want which were words repeatedly uttered from his lips. That ‘my pussy wasn’t worth shit’, and that I really was ‘shit in bed’ amongst other things. 

He was like Jekyll and Hyde, night and day. It was very confusing having my best friend and lover to be so nasty and full of cruel hate.  

Well I really tried to avoid getting the police involved and even called up his probation officer as a professional alternative after he threatened to throw acid in my face and tried to make me homeless - hoping he perhaps could speak some sense into him. 
Well today it finally happened, the next step on his linear progression of abuse: after yet again accusing me of sleeping with a vast array of people, (which has never been true), he got up, walked over to the bed which I was sitting and planted three punches to my face and jaw. I started screaming, so he picked up a pillow and started telling me to shut the fuck up - I watched his face calculate his thought process as he proceeded to pick up a large glass bottle. 
‘Is this guy going to finally kill me by smothering me with this pillow he’s grasping? Or is he going to hit me with this bottle instead?’ I thought - I honestly didn’t care, I just carried on screaming as to set off an alarm for the neighbour next door. 

She let me call the police on her phone after he had decorated my face and stole my phone before running from the building. The police came and they asked me a million questions - not just about the current event, but our general dynamic and concluded that they wanted to prosecute him also with coercive control. 
As I was doing my statement, he turned up back at the house with a face like a slapped arse and an apology. He looked poignant and remorseful as the police snapped him in handcuffs, “you’re not going to press charges are you babe?” he asked.
Truth is that I don’t know, but I’m gutted that I’ve lost my best friend and partner. 
He’s on license as he came out of prison in July last year, so chances are he’ll be recalled and’ll be going back there for a few months to complete his sentence behind bars. 
Lost, confused, lonely and gutted.

Is my(33f) husband(34m) verbally/emotionally abusing me? If so what do i do now?....,"Im pretty sure that my,(33f) husband(34m) is verbally and emotionally abusive and im looking for some reassurance. Whenever we have any sort of conflict he always says things that I think are really mean. In the past he has called me ""crazy bitch"" ""dumb bitch"" ""psycho"" ""dummy"" ""retarded"" ""child"" most recently he got angry because I didn't put something away and started berating me for it because the kids got into it. I said ""ok"" and he said ""its like talking to a fucking wall!"" When i confront him about being so mean he says ""i was mad you dont have to nice when you're mad!"" so basically he thinks when you're angry and in an argument you can say anything you want. On top of that i feel like I never live up to his expectations. Before lockdown our baby gate broke off the wall(it was used and had constant use) that same day i accidentally broke the coffee pot(also used) instead of writing them both off as accidents he lectured me on and on about how "" i need to be more careful with our thongs so we can keep them longer, because we want to have nice things right?!"" I tried to explain that it was just an accident about the coffee pot and accidents happen. ""He said it's not a fucking accident! It didn't spontaneously brake! You broke it!"" I just shut down after that but he went on and on about how I dont want to be ""better"" or ""change"" and how he watches me and sees how careless and rough I am and how I dont listen to how things are ""supposed"" to be used like using metal utensils on nonstick pans. Also the other morning he couldn't find any clean work pants. He had been off for almost 2 weeks due to covid but im a SAHM and do all the laundry. He got so pissed he didn't have clean pants he punched a whole in the wall and didnt speak to me the whole day even when he got home. I got angry at this very entitled outburst and his excuse was that he ""represents"" our family and that im making him look bad. Also that our children always have full drawers of laundry and he always ""comes in last."" Again he was off for 2 weeks and could have done his own laundry and our children cant do their own laundry. Im at loss and writing this all out has made it all the more clear that im not crazy. Is this abuse? If so what should i do when he starts to get angry the next time in the moment? Where do I go from here? Is it worth it to try to go to couples counseling or should i just move on? We have two young children and I just want to do what's best for them but divorce sounds very very scary still.",domesticviolence
Why is it so difficult to see it as abusive?,"I dont know if I need validation or what. The other day we were talking and I got up to go inside because I was getting annoyed and he grabbed my wrist until I sat back down. When we both went inside I told him that he can't do stuff like that to me and he said that he could do whatever he wants and grabbed me by my hair and kept saying, ""Do you understand?"" Wouldn't let go until I said yes. This isn't the first time he's grabbed me by my hair when I've told him he can't do something to me and wouldn't let go until I repeated what he wanted me to say. 


When I confront him that this is abusive he says it's just a joke and he isn't serious and he's just playing around with me. Then he apologized and said he didn't realize it felt abusive or felt ""real"" to me and he wouldn't play around with me like that or act so rough with me. Today he's been nothing but sweet and kind. When I read back what I wrote I know it sounds bad and if someone told me their husband did this to them I'd be shocked and tell them how wrong it was. So why am I always questioning and second guessing myself and wondering if I'm overreacting?",domesticviolence
Trouble understanding the language to use to describe abuse.,"I [30F] had a tough childhood. I consider my dad to be an emotionally abusive man, but it was not his fault. I forgave him long ago and have a lot of empathy now. When I was a junior in high school I had 0 self esteem and severe anxiety because of my dad. It was then that I met my ex fiancee (let's call him Chad).

Chad was charming at first. We were happy. I was head over heels for him until we went to college. Then he started to withdraw. He wouldn't visit me (I went to a school about 2 hours from him). He was emotionally unavailable. I was a freshman. I had no self esteem. I was lost. I transferred to be with him (it was a much better school and I have no regrets for other reasons). The relationship took an even more toxic turn. He would pressure me to have sex with other women (I am bisexual but am not so into the multiple partners at the same time thing). He would pressure me into threesomes. He was a habitual cheater. He was constantly encouraging me to fuck other people I didn't want to fuck so he could feel better about doing it behind my back. All the while he reminded me constantly how worthless I was, and how lucky I was he loved me because no one else ever would. There was at least one night when he pressured me I to sex I absolutely did not want, and I cried a lot after.

Then we got engaged and moved. He graduated college late and wanted to go to law school. He moved to be with me and contributed 0 to the household. I had 3 jobs for a while to keep us afloat while he played go on the internet. He refused to take me on dates. He was terrible with money and wouldn't let me spend anything myself, but would buy gadgets often. He refused to get a job. But still I was lucky to have him. 

He started to pressure me to have sex with my girlfriends, either alone or in front of him. He would find other women and pressure me into sleeping with them. I contracted an STD from one of these encounters. He went on dates with other women and told me about them. He tried to fuck my friends. He had a mistress who was a friend's ex (this happened a lot) who he fucked for years. He didn't try to hide it. He often told me how much better she was than me. He started law school, did terribly at it, and reminded me constantly that I was the reason he was failing.

He wanted me to be something sexually that I wasn't. He would dress me up in BDSM lingerie and clothes. He would complain I wasn't sexy enough or didn't meet his needs. He told me what to wear. He constantly demeaned my looks or clothing choices. By the end he was telling me to wear sexual clothes that made me uncomfortable.

I should have left, but he told me that I promised to love him unconditionally. I though no one would want me. That I was disgusting. I stayed for 10 years. I believed I was worthless. I only got out because I developed a crush that let me see things more clearly (he did not like me back). 

Now I'm married to a great guy but I feel cut off from him and totally numb. We made some unrelated mistakes. He was selfish early on and steamrolled me. I didn't have a voice. He NEVER would do anything to hurt me. But I feel so numb.

Can anyone help me describe what my ex was and did? He never hit me, so I never understood what was happening as abuse.  Everything I try to use to talk about it feels wrong. I feel like if I name it I can start dealing with it. Also any resources for healing would be greatly appreciated.",domesticviolence
Hello. I need some help.,Hello. I need some help. My best friend is in a really bad domestic violence relationship. She is codependent and suffering. We stopped talking after her first son was born because she started being rude and I decided I didn't need that in my life but started talking a year ago. Something told my gut to get ahold of her and sure enough my gut was right. I don't need to tell everything but I can say that he has tied to kill her and he was arrested and bailed out the next day by his parents. She didn't get the proper help she needed by the victims advocate and lied about that happened even though she had hand marks around her neck. He has said he was going to kill her and her 2 kids several times. So one time she I didn't hear from her for a month and I begged her to just tell me she was ok that's all I needed to know. She agreed and said sorry. So I fucked up I got upset another month went by I left her text messages voice mail and nothing back. I got upset because I been working so hard to help her and get her help I fucked up and sent her some messages I regret nothing mean just how my feelings are hurt and I love her and always are there for her and all I asked for her is to tell me she was alright. She was getting on Instagram and sharing videos so why couldn't she just send a small response. Before we talked almost 5 times a week. Now she is not responding I haven't heard anything. I have called left voicemail again I have begged her to talk to me. I have been working with a victims advocate to get help to help her. She hasn't posted anything no activity in 2 weeks. What should I do stop trying to get ahold of her let it go. Call for a wellness check. Contact her brother tell him what's going on. Btw she hasn't told anyone what's really going on she was a foster child and doesn't have parents or a supportive family just her brother she talks to. The husband family is in denial and blames both of them for the so called drama and doesn't realize she is in deep danger. I had been working with a detective about 6 months ago to get enough evidence to charge him with attempted murder and we had everything but her statement that's all he needed. but he does tell her all the time how he's going to kill her and the kids drive off a cliff drive into the barrier he's going to kill himself he's already shot a gun in the house with the kids.

Leaving Codependent Abusive Relationship. Me (29M) - He (33M),"Hi Guys, 

First thank you for this subreddit and for taking the time to read this; I'll try to keep it short as possible. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was with my partner (we were engaged) for 4 /12 years.  It was a match made in heaven in my eyes and in some twisted way I still see it that way.  We both work in the same industry as freelancers, have many of the same likes and way of living.  The big difference was his drinking was a huge problem.  Everytime he would get drunk he would either hit me or verbally drag me through the mud and call me a spic, good for nothing artist that wouldn't be anyone in this world without him.  He would insult my family and friends and say he was the only one who understood me.  He would never remember the fights or his actions.  His apologizes half ass because he did constantly.  2 years into the relationship our sex life was basically once every six months, I proposed an open relationship because I figured he might want to be with other men, I was fine with it because it's just sex not love.  But what bothered me is that he never wanted to have sex with me, I always begged and was shut down.  Even acts of affection like kissing he would reject me.  All while he drank and would get mean.  He would get jealous if I hung out with friends. Kept tabs on me.  August of 2019 we had a vacation and it was great until the end when he got drunk at his family wedding and hit me in the face with flowers leaving scratches on my face.  When we got back to NYC where we live every month he would be more cruel in his drinking and I would do everything in my power to strengthen the relationship by doing evening walks, figure drawing classes of each other during dinner, biking, upstate hikes for the day and etc.   He would fight me on all of them and say he never had time or was too busy.  I understood his career was taking off and mine was too so we threw ourselves into our work but I knew what was at stake.  

&amp;#x200B;

In January of 2020 I began running and working out to shed some weight so he can find me attractive.  But in those workouts which I haven't done in awhile because he didn't like when I worked out because he didn't know where I was, I began to reclaim my old self before I met him and realized what an abusive asshole he is to me.   He perfectly can tear me down and build me up and I allowed it because I was and still am in love with him.  Because I see him as a human who deserves respect he sees me as a stuffed animal he can do what he pleases with and have no consequences to his actions. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the beginning of Feb he came back from a work trip and lost his mind when he got home because I didn't wash the dishes (there were 3 plates and 2 cups) and I didn't make the bed properly.  He started throwing things around the house and this was the first time I ever saw him lose his cool sober and I got so scared I left the apartment and so did he.  I came back and he wasn't home and I packed my things so quickly and left to stay at a hotel for 7 days near the apartment.  I told him I needed space to understand why he thinks it's okay to treat me like this.  He said me leaving was a break up and told me some of the worst things I have ever heard in my life.  I cried and just wanted to run into his arms nonetheless.

&amp;#x200B;

I went to therapy and was told abusive relationships are difficult to get out of and not to be hard on myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then covid happen.  5 months apart, me in long island and he spent it in virginia.

Within those 5 months we spoke and talked about the relationship and how he is sorry for everything he ever did and regrets not doing the simple things with me to enjoy life.   I was so excited and hopeful he was showing signs of accountability and wanting to do the work.   I knew he was seeing guys over there because his libido came back and I was fine with it.  He came back last week and told me he was coming for work and to work on our relationship.  Only for me to find out he was spending the time in the apartment we built and I made home with the guy from virginia.   I know we aren't together but I just wish he didn't fuck with my head like this! I wish he didn't disrespect me and give me hope.  If he found someone else he should have told me.  Not left me with the impression he wanted to salvage things and bring his lover.  

He is doing things with him that i asked, walks at the end of the day, drawing each other during dinner, and being kind to him, not drinking as much.  

&amp;#x200B;

When i called him out on it he said that the guy is nothing to him but he succeed in making me jealous.  That the guy is an experiment on how to love me properly.  I knew he was lying because we met face to face yesterday and he told me he was torn because he loves him.

&amp;#x200B;

I made the choice yesterday after he left, after I fought with him because I asked him to stay longer with me and he said he had plans with the guy.  I made the choice for him that he couldn't.  I left officially and blocked him.  

&amp;#x200B;

I gave him almost 5 years of my life for him to throw it away in 7 days because he couldn't wait to see me and wanted to flaunt in my face that someone else wanted him..... I feel crazy because I know he is sick in the head, but I love him and wish it was us not them together.  

&amp;#x200B;

This will be a long journey of recovery.  Im scared and lonely but I can live with myself knowing I showed my love through actions and words to show someone I really loved them.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you guys",domesticviolence
Antidepressants after abuse?,"Hi all,

I’ve been out 9 months. The last 3 have been extremely hard and I am curious to know others experiences with psyc meds after abuse. 

I’ve never taken antidepressants. I do have some troubling substances abuse issues (alcohol, Xanax, ketamine), albeit mostly under control, it has affected my ability to function in the past and very recently.

I’ve been with a great therapist for over a year, and while she was instrumental in getting me out of physical harms way, I’m still struggling very much with the trauma, missing him terribly, still very stuck under his control, unable to move on with my love life, obsessing over what he thinks or says of me. He threatened me into having an abortion I didn’t want and raped me very early on in the relationship.. these were the 2 major injuries to me that still hurt me daily.

It’s been no contact for 9 months, I have no clue of anyway to reach him or where he is living now.

On the surface I know that I am doing alright considering, my people are proud of me, but inside it is a different story. 

Sorry for the length, just want to be understood. Please share how meds have and have not helped you through your stories.

Domestic Violence - how to navigate this when your loved one is a victim?,"Hello - I'm seeking out advice/support. I'm not sure how to approach and navigate the current situation that is happening with my sister and her fiance. Please share what you would do in this situation. I'm seeking legal advice and emotional advice. Even personal advice/experiences. A different perspective maybe. I'm just trying to figure out how to navigate this situation.  I want to be there for my sister but I want to do what's right as well.   


Situation:   


My mom basically gave my sister a guilt trip today because she never goes to visit them. My sister didn't visit them at all during the holidays last year. No visit for either of their birthdays or Mother's Day. Even though they live only 20 minutes away. My parent's never see her.  So in retaliation to that - my sister contacted my mother today and sent her a picture and told her that the dresser fell on her and that's why she wasn't coming to visit for Father's Day. The picture she sent was of her face. In the picture she has a huge busted up lip, swollen nose and looks like she will have two black eyes soon. After some interrogation from my mothers end (because my mom didn't just fall off a turnip truck- she knew that wasn't from a dresser) - my sister admitted that it was her fiance that did it. They have been living together for several years. Maybe 8 years or so.   


Her (my sister) current stance on the situation is that she is fine. She does not want to leave him.  She does not want the police involved. He is ""not that kind of man"". He feels bad. He's been saying he needs counseling like he's had in the past. His temper just got away from him. Sometimes he sees red. He asked her to call the cops on him after it happened. He wanted her to go to my moms house for the night after it happened.  (These are all the excuses and things she has told me and/or my mother today.) She also said that there was not alcohol involved. It is hard to know what to believe from her though. She also let it slip to me that this ""hasn't happened in a long time"". So even though she told both of us it was the first time this has happened - that was a lie. 

&amp;#x200B;

Full Picture/Background info:   


Some background information about my sister. She is a recovering alcoholic, maybe active (not sure). 34 years old. She has no children. She was married for about 18 months in her early 20s then divorced. She started drinking in her early 20's and went downhill from there. She's always had social anxiety. ""Chip on her shoulder"" persona throughout her entire lifetime. She has a few DUI's from her really bad days of alcoholism. She's been in in-patient rehab facilities. She's told me that she's also a sex addict. She is also bulimic. She's told us she's been raped before. She used to go out a lot to bars and I think there is a lot of things that have happened to her that we don't even know about. A lot of legal things with her life she won't tell us. She bottles things up a lot. I'm not sure if there are any other drugs involved in her life or her fiances life. I know they smoke cannabis sometimes. And I think she is still drinking. She was talking with an online therapist on talkspace off and on within the last few years but she doesn't do that anymore. Her and my mom butt heads a lot because my mom tells her how it is all the time. Last time things were bad with my sister - it stressed my mom out so much that my mother swallowed a whole bottle of pills and was rushed to the hospital to have her stomach pumped. So my mom can't handle this new situation that has now arose. My mom's psychiatrist (from the last drama time) told her she had to distance herself from her daughter, (my sister). And that is now what my mom will try to do again. She won't be able to handle seeing Robyn stay together with an abusive partner. My dad is kind of like me. He's upset about it but doesn't know what to do.   


The ""fiance"" (man that beat up my sister Friday night) has a ""car salesman"" type of personality. He always drives her around when she needs to go somewhere. He's always the one talking when they are together. Robyn is never around my parents or myself without him there. It's almost like she's using him as a crutch. At least this is what I thought of their relationship in the early days. He isn't someone I ever imagined my sister being with. But my sister has changed so much since we were kids. SHe's not the same person anymore. She hasn't been the same since she started heavily drinking in her early 20's. They live in the middle of nowhere Oklahoma. I don't know a whole lot about him. He is the type that will lie and spin the truth. He grew up in a different small town in Oklahoma. He is around 33 years old and has 2 daughters of his own. Both of them with a different woman other than my sister. My sister actually works with his mom at a laundry mat. And even though they are only 20 minute drive from my parents. My sister never goes to visit my parents. (I personally live in Florida. I've been living here since February. Before that, I lived in Germany for 5 years preceding. So I've been physically very far away from all of this.) I flew to Oklahoma just last week to visit them all. I hadn't seen my parents and my sister in almost 2 years. I just moved back to the states from Germany. Now I'm able to visit my parents and sister much easier and quicker. I swear last week when I hugged my sister for the first time in almost 2 years, that I could smell alcohol. If you know someone that is an alcoholic - you know that smell that the skin and pores releases. 

&amp;#x200B;

What to do now?   


So when we first got the real truth about what happened. Of course my mom and dad were ready to get a gun and go after him. Then the next thought was -  to call the police.   
But then we have my sister asking us not to tell anyone, asking us not post anything, asking us not to call the police or to call her fiance. (Which she called her boyfriend today-- which I noticed that she didn't refer to him as her fiance like usual.) We have evidence on our phone of what her face looks like. And her admission to what happened. She was careful not to give too many details about what happened too. She said she didn't want us reporting him so she didn't want to tell us. I did get from her that it happened Friday night and that it was him that did that to her face. And that it was because of stress from money and he ""exploded"".  I tried to convince her to leave him. To move in with me. But, she didn't want any of that. My mom told her she was buying her a ticket to fly her to Florida to stay with me. She didn't want that. Didn't want to talk about it.  She's been saying she's fine. And it's not a big deal. She's asked me not to think about it. She's been saying contradicting things to me all day. For example she said he ""barely drinks"". Then she states later that he doesn't drink at all. Then also she stated that she had a safe place figured out for that night he beat her that she could have gone to if she needed to. But then later she says that she feels completely safe with him. If you have to even think of a safe place - you do not feel safe.   


So my question is -- what do I do in this situation? 

Does anyone know of an organization that I can connect my sister with so she can get some professional advice? I think she would be open speaking with a therapist, maybe.

"Please give me advice, I honestly don't know to do.","
The person in question isn't my ex rather than my sisters and the father of my nieces. Over the 11 years he's caused my family a  ton of trauma. 

*This is a long one. 
Back in 2012-2014 my sister would have horrible anxiety and panic attacks to the point she would have to go to the hospital. During that time he would slowly become an alcoholic and cheat on her with minors.
He was 21 and the girls were between 15-17, he was wasted when he told her. He also raped my sister which caused her to become pregnant. (It was nonconsensual she had no choice but to have sex with him because he was wasted and she didn't want him to snap) 
He also once walked in on me while I was in the shower when I was 13ish but everyone seemed to forget.

During those years I was in and out of the hospital with her, keep in mind I was absolutely depressed and suicidal. 
I once had to fight him off because he trying to take my niece while he was drunk. 

In 2017 they had a big fight (We all live together to save money)
he was also hooked on cocaine. He was trying to take my youngest niece which was 3 at the time. As I was running down the stairs carrying her while he was chasing me to get to the other room to call the cops. I slipped on the last few step, the baby was safe since I was fast enough to prop her standing up. Me on the other hand wasnt I had a sprained ankle. 
He accused me of throwing MY NIECE to get back at him when HE was chasing me.

In 2018, he was so out of it. Me and my mother had left to mexico to visit my grandmother since she was dying. My dad couldn't go since he had a stroke shortly after the 2017 incident. My sister kicked him out and he would sit outside for about an hour being absolute lunatic.

2019 was the final straw.
My sister went out after work and he completely lost his shit. Banging on my door asking for her. I had no idea where she was because she didn't tell she was going out.
The next few months were one of the most traumitizing moments of my life. I believe I got ptsd. 

He retaliated by crashing their car, threatening to kill her and take the girls from her. 
Then he got a restraining order placed for a year (Sister, nieces, me etc), can't be near our house or anyone within 100yrds. He gets to see his kids every sunday but my sister usually trails along because she loves him. 
A whole bunch of stuff happened from october - december he supposedly got clean so no coke or alcohol. 

Now 2020: 
He moved to an area nearby and got kicked out twice, then he moved again to napa (If you have can find any articles for an armed robbery in the contra costa or napa area please send it me! I believe it was 4 people) He and his friends robbed somewhere and they split the cash unevenly and he got jumped by them. 

Now in may he moved literally 4 blocks away and he has a gun illegally. My sister talks to him everyday, he drinks again and he's verbally abusive towards my nieces. The older one told me he constantly yells at them for no reason. My niece told me that she fears for her and her sisters life and she doesn't want her life to go back to what it once was. She said that their mom just sits their pretending as if nothing is wrong. My sister doesn't want to give me a copy of the restraining order.
She's in denial that it's abuse, if you have any articles that I can send to her to prove her wrong. PLEASE send them to me. 

If anyone has any information on what I can do (I'm in california), to help my nieces let me know. I'm currently 21 and unemployed, I don't know if there's much I can do. 

I can't type every single thing that has happened throughout the years.",domesticviolence
"I Finally Escaped, Again","I feel stupid for going back to my ex, but I had nowhere to go during the Coronavirus Quarantine. I spent 3 months at his house and it was great in the beginning. He was so nice, always complimenting me, spending time with me, doing things for me, etc. towards the end though, things got bad again. He started using drugs, being emotionally and physically abusive, and forcing me to do everything around the house. Any money I had would be taken away from me to support his drug habit. He stopped being interested in me and wouldn’t spend any time with me. I felt so alone and the fact that I couldn’t go anywhere made things so much worse. It finally came to a head when he woke me up one morning demanding money. Somehow he had figured out that a friend from Guam had sent me $50 to renew my I.D. He must have unlocked my phone while I was sleeping with my fingerprint and gone through my messages. I could tell that he was sick from not having his drugs and I refused to go get the money for him. He proceeded to beat me all over and pull me out of the bed by my hair. I screamed for help and after kicking me in my abdomen a few times he left me alone. I managed to pull myself up and lock the bedroom door before he came back and hurt me some more. I was genuinely afraid that he was going to kill me (I’m very petite and he is very big, 6ft.10 and 300 lbs.) I was laying on the bed trying to recover from the beating when I heard a knock on the door and a voice saying “Police! Open up!” He had actually called the cops on me! When I opened the door I was grateful to see an officer who had helped me in the past and knew that my ex had a history of abuse and a problem with drugs. As I was leaving with the officer I passed out. He had to call an ambulance and I was taken to the hospital where I was admitted and kept for observation for that day and night. During the attack, he had given me a concussion, a black eye, and caused bruising to my kidneys. 

Once the doctor determined that I was ok to be released, they realized that I had nowhere to go. They contacted the local domestic violence shelter where I had stayed before and they were full. I ended up at the city homeless shelter, where I had been attacked before. That shelter is full of drugs and violence, in fact, the police were called that night for a fight involving 5 men, one of which ended up in the hospital in critical condition. After a sleepless night on a hard cot, I spent the day at social services trying to find a place to stay. I was still in my pajamas and slippers from the morning I left. Thankfully the shelter placed me in a hotel room. I have been moved from hotel to hotel since then and have slowly been trying to get my life back. It’s difficult but at least I am away from him and safe. I’m having weekly visitation with my daughter again now that we don’t have to quarantine anymore!",domesticviolence

I feel bad for dobbing him in...,"Hi all,

So today I got so upset that I called the police to see how they could help me.
My (30F) partner (30M) has been yelling at my kids and I in a really threatening and scary manner to the point that I never feel 100% safe at home... and I never want to leave the kids alone with him...

Well today the police told me it sounds like I need a restraining order put in place and they will come and get him on Friday to serve him and to tell him to get out, that he can’t live here anymore etc...

I feel terrible... I love this man but he can’t treat me and my kids this way... but I am scared that the restraining order might be a bit of overkill but I just can’t think of any other way they could help me keep him away and out of my house etc...

I feel so guilty and like I am making a mountain out of a molehill because it’s not like he is hitting us etc..
I just don’t think I could break up with him safely without this?

WHAT DO I DO?

Try by myself and hop he is fine or do I go the police route???",domesticviolence
3ish months since I left him and it's better but still I live in fight or flight constantly,I left my abusive ex because of covid-19 and his increasing rate and severity of pyschological and emotional abuse. I knew I had to break up with him when I thought he was gonna kill me and I was screaming at him to get off me but he made things worse by forcefully shutting me up. I have been doing better but he decided to text me from a fake app number because he thought I blocked his number but I haven't yet in case he decides to try contact me like he did again and I need to get a restraining order if he gets threating again.  I had to move in with other people because I don't want him knowing where I live and had to leave a job because I had severe attacks daily that were triggered thinking he might show up because he knew where I worked. I feel like maybe I don't get to be so fucked up from him because people have been through worse and deal better than I do. I just don't want to think anymore that everyone in my life is a threat. I know my childhood made me go on to pick a piece of shit like him as a partner because my needs were far from met and yay me I found a guy who will help with everything. Turns out he did that for awhile and that's because I did whatever he asked but then he stopped helping me altogether and just turned very abusive. I don't want to feel sorry for myself anymore. I don't want pity. I just wish we didn't live in such a shitty world that vulnerable adults like me aren't given more support and love and looked after better then they are.,domesticviolence
Abuser has found a new victim. What to do?,"My longterm girlfriend escaped an abusive marriage. Restraining orders, and all. 

We have since moved on to a city pretty far away, and are finally feeling safe 3 years later.  I personally check up on her abuser (carefully and only through social media) to make sure he isnt up to any schemes that could put us in danger.

I recently discovered he is engaged again. He gets engaged very fast after dating, and its through all sorts of coercion and manipulation that he got my girfriend to submit to his request that got her trapped. They have a wedding website set up for a wedding that will take place in 2021. Every bit of evidence screams she is about to experience the same dangerous situation. Though he did show signs of being an abuser early on, the guy flipped a serious switch after the marriage.

On one hand, I feel relieved that my girlfriend may be ultimately safe from a very unstable man who would obsess over her if he were not moving on.  But I just cant help feeling like I am the only one who knows what will happen to this poor woman (My girflriend doesnt know of the engagement) .  


I have 2 tough questions:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Do I tell my girlfriend that he has recently gotten engaged, in hopes that she will feel safer and her anxiety and trauma decrease? Or is it just better to not bring this up and pretend like I know nothing?  


2) Is there anything I can do or should do to help the woman recently engaged to him, who will no doubt have her life ruined, if not completely eliminated by this violent and manipulative man?  Or do I need to move on myself, let it be, in order to not endanger my own girlfriend?

Restraining order expired and he is posting videos of me again, I had a case of sexual assault and domestic violence against my ex-bf two years ago. He plead to a lesser charge and received probation. I was able to get a restraining order that lasted until this month. Today I came across videos he posted two days ago of me and us during our time together two years ago. They are not sexual but he is captioning them with harassing statements and calling me crazy. I do not want to report them on the website because he will know I have seen them and he is looking for attention. I wish I would have extended my order of protection before it expired.

PhD research to increase safety of victims,"My name is Thomas Nally and I am a PhD student with the University of Central Lancashire (UCLan) and a forensic psychologist in training. I am conducting a study examining how victims in abusive relationships protect themselves.

As an individual with lived experience, you would provide valuable insights into behaviours and strategies used to reduce or prevent the risk of abuse. You are invited to take part in this research if you have been a victim of an abusive relationship in the past, but are not in an abusive relationship at the moment.

If you decide to participate in this study, you will be asked to complete an interview, using skype/zoom or a telephone. This interview will ask you about safety strategies you have used and factors that may help us understand why these strategies are used. You will not be identified in the write up of the findings.

I’ve Never Told Anyone About My Abuse,"I am 20F and have never told anyone about what happened to me. I could not accept what was happening in the moment so I ignored it. I was in a relationship where I was being physically and emotionally abused. 

My best friend assumed I was sneaking around with her ex behind her back and blocked me everywhere, I tried to talk to her but she never answered. This same guy got close to me and wanted me to be with him, and I never wanted to be, but it quickly developed into an emotionally and physically abusive relationship. I needed my friends the most at the time in my life but I had to go through it alone (some other friends had decided to side with my best friend).

I cannot believe I stayed in such a shitty relationship because I consider myself to be very independent and not submissive. He had me wrapped around his finger and I found myself changing and bending my morals just to be with him. 

I told myself the slapping, choking and biting was just a kink of his. I told him he was hurting me but he insisted on doing these things because he would be aroused. The biting hurt so much that I would silently scream, just waiting for the moment to be over. When he slapped me, I felt so worthless. I found myself holding on because I was so scared to let go. 
I feared how he would react if I left him. I stayed in this toxic relationship for half a year until he decided that I wasn’t good enough for him and dumped me. 

I’ve been trying to self heal, but I think that I need to talk to someone about this so I can get past it.",domesticviolence

So I ran with my four children in the middle of the night to get away from my abusive husband. My friend picked us up and took us two hours and 45 mins away to her house to be safe. I have a preemie who is 7 pounds now ..a two year old...9 year old...and 12 year old. Apparently in the midst of grabbing everything from the house I forgot my wic Similac neosure for my baby and I just ran COMPLETELY out and no money to buy any and I honestly do not know what to do..I'm so scared. My friend who we moved in with is out of funds and I have no family. I called the pediatricians around here and none have any samples and hospital says they have a shortage for labor and delivery only right now. I am at a loss and so scared...anyone have any ideas because I'm out of all...oh the two local food banks here do not have ANY formula...idk I need prayers and help

I just want to give up but I know I can not do that because I am all that my four babies have. Especially now that I left and pretty much us 5 is all we have.. we have no other family and the only friend that we have is the one that is allowing us to live with her until we can get on our feet to get our own house. 

I just feel so hopeless and useless because I cannot even provide for my own children what kind of mother am I? Maybe I shouldn't have left or maybe I should go back and just deal with it for the well being of my children I do not know what to do or what to think I honestly just feel like a failure what I mean is I have failed as a mother... A wife..and  just a woman in general!! 

I CALLED SIMILAC AND THEY ARE GOING TO SEND ME SOME FORMULA BUT IT TAKES AROUND 14 DAYS TO PROCESS THE ORDER THEN THEY SHIP IT OUT SO THE LADY ON THE PHONE SAID I CAN EXPECT IT AROUND 20 TO 30 DAYS OR A MONTH PRETTY MUCH. I ALSO CALLED WIC TWICE ACTUALLY, AND TALK TO TWO DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND EXPLAINED MY SITUATION AND THEY CHECKED AND THEY HAVE NO SAMPLES OR EXTRAS OF ANY KIND OF FORMULA.  THEY GAVE ME THE SOONEST APPOINTMENT THEY COULD WHICH IS THIS COMING THURSDAY. BUT I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT SOMETHING NOW BECAUSE WE ARE COMPLETELY OUT OF THE SIMILAC NEOSURE NOW. I HAVE NONE TO GIVE MY SON SO I HAVE BEEN CALLING MESSAGING AND DOING EVERYTHING I CAN THINK OF TO AT LEAST COME UP WITH THE $24 TO BUY A CAN TO AT LEAST LAST TILL WIC APPOINTMENT THURSDAY. 

I HAD ASKED ALL MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY THE LOAN ME SOME MONEY OR TO EVEN SEND A VIRTUAL GIFT CARD AND I TOLD THEM I WOULD PAY THEM BACK FRIDAY AT MIDNIGHT TRIPLE THE AMOUNT. WHICH PRETTY MUCH MEANS THAT FOR $25 I WAS OFFERING TO GIVE THEM $75 AND THE LAST 2 PEOPLE I ASKED I TOLD THEM I WOULD PAY THEM BACK $100 FOR THE 25 AND NO SUCCESS YET BUT I CAN'T GIVE UP I HAVE TO FIGURE THIS OUT ASAP.",domesticviolence

Is this verbal or emotional abuse or am I overreacting?,"Not sure if what I'm experiencing could be verbal or emotional abuse? My husband tends to snap at me a lot. Not even in moments of stress, but in every day conversation, like harsh, aggressive tone, etc. In the past I've told him that it starts to affect my self-esteem and makes me wonder what's wrong with me and why can't he just speak to me nicely. For several months he was working on it and it stopped being a problem, but since the pandemic started he's started to do it again more often on a day to day basis. 


The last time it happened was last week. We were eating and he had to suddenly run into work and all I did was remind him of something related to his job he had told me about earlier. This led to him snapping at me that he already knew, etc. When he got home he apologized, but then got mad at me because I was still upset??? and said why can't he apologize and we just move on? It was hard for me to immediately move on because the snapping was happening every single day leading up to that incident. Like at that point it was the culmination of being snapped at day after day. He didn't get it at first but then he ended up apologizing again and explained he was stressed with work and took it out on me and was sorry. But then he added that I push him and he felt like I was ""challenging him"" when I said the work reminder, which is why he snapped at me. It feels like he started with an apology for his behavior but then put the blame on me? He said he would continue to work on it and since last week we haven't had any issues but idk. I wasn't trying to push him or challenge him and just wanted to remind him of something. I just dont get what I did that was so wrong? Any advice helps. I did kind of confront him that it feels kind of abusive sometimes when this happens and he started asking, ""Do you really think I'm an abuser?"" and saying how hurt he was that I'd even say that and then I felt guilty for thinking that.",domesticviolence
Im stupid. How long to feel better after minor strangulation?,"Maybe this doesnt belong here Im not sure where to label this since Im kinda confused.   


I have to spill my sin and I think it might qualify as some level of borderline abuse and could really use some advice. Its a graphic story of what just happened though so please don't read if your sensitive.   
My overall question though if you don't want to read id how long does it take you to feel better after ""minor"" strangulation?

&amp;#x200B;

I feel way to embarassed to go to my Dr about this and Im a hypochondriac so maybe Im thinking to much on it.

&amp;#x200B;

Im 29, really fat and partially blind so I don't get out much. I have a pretty face but not much else. I have no friends and my idea of a wet dream is when dream men hold my hand. My family has been belittling me about being almost 30 with no friends, boyfriend or life pretty much since my birthday. Though I just finally graduated college with my BA.🤷🏻‍♀️

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway an ex hit me up the other day. Like the last guy I ever dated eight years ago. He was a charming douche but I still kinda had fun with him and he was the first guy I had more than one consensual sexual encounter with at 22. Even though Iv never really liked it and he would always say ""your welcome"" after like ge did me the favor so I dumped him.

&amp;#x200B;

But yesterday I was desperate and dumb and here was some rare attention so I cleaned up my apartment, got as nice looking as I could and he came over saying he would only stay for like a half hour and talk and stuff cuz I told him I might not feel the best. But I really liked the feeling of being hugged and cuddled. Its not something   
I ever get to feel and he knows how pathetic I am so I know he used that to charm me. And so my dumb brain turned off and I gave in to his advances. I thought this time I would be assertive and a strong women and try not to care about my fat body while he had a nice one. Plus I had ovarian surgery last year and haven't been able to reach orgasm since (though never had issues before blah) and thought I would try once with a person instead of myself to see if it could fix me.   
It was ok at first. Though he is kinda on the small penis end he is a huge guy. Back in the day he always begged me for blow jobs and I never gave in because I told him it reminded me of bad stuff I went through as a kid and grosses me out. But 29 year old me has been through therapy and wanted to be confident so I did it and that's when I noticed he wasn't simply douchy like long ago he started saying a lot of degrading things to me and forcing my arms and head to do things even when I tried to pull away. Then when he tried normal way out of nowhere he started strangling me. Im 5ft2 and he is 6ft3 with large hands and it shocked me a lot. I started struggling and he just squeezed harder. I never passed out and could kinda breath tiny kinda trying to kick him off. but my veins felt really restricted. He's really strong so I could not move his hands. But he let up and I was too shocked to say anything but then he kept randomly doing it off and on. I am not sure if I froze and thats why I didnt have the courage to end it there. But I am a people pleaser I guess and he had driven far so I felt bad and didn't want to disappoint him or irritate him. At that point I just was screaming in my head for it to end and starting thinking of scape options like how to make him happy so it will stop in my head but I still pretended to enjoy it a little and pretended everything was fine and pretended to be the confident woman like I had read about trying to be. And then he put a pillow over my head and was preasing down on my mouth area. When I freed my mouth gasping for air he fought me to keep it on and kept trying to stop me breathing and it took me a couple minutes to get it away. Or felt that way. Then he acted like he was all nice and tried touching me and holding me down so I pretended to like it so it would be over faster. But it wasn't and he forced my head to do other things that were a lot more painful and degrading than the how to articals described. I did managed a loud awkward no with one disgusting unforgivable reqest and keep my head away despite the yanking till he moved on. So I was kinda panicking now inside but still trying to make him happy so he would finish and leave. Heck I even smiled and laughed awkwardly trying to talk about things when I got the chance to breath freely but he kept telling me to shut up. Though I know he knew he was hurting me at times because when I couldn't hold the fake enjoyment it made him happier and he strangled me a few more times randomly even though I was clawing and kicking at him. By the end I just did what he wanted plastered a fake smile on my face because if he would just be done it would stop. At least that was my thinking. When it was over, after he said he would just finish ""on me"" but then forced it in my mouth to do it there, nasty grossest crap, and made a few more rude remarks it was over. Throughout it he also pretended the condom fell off and kept going though I told him there was another and seemed to mumble something about being pregnant already idk. Hopefully my dud ovary and blocked tube does its job. He also slapped my body several times throughout. He was all pleased with himself and I just kinda obvious fake laughed it off awkwardly kinda but thinking back I was in a scared disgusted daze at the same time. And then he just left trying to be charming and give me a hug and mumbled something about next time and I got kinda mad finally and said ""next time? il be hurting you"" he laughed and I pushed him out the door. I also said ""Your Welcome"" as I shut it just as a throwback. So my self confidence apparently only kickes in when I don't have a giant sergeant holding me down of course ugh.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like a damn fool for even thinking of trusting anyone to touch me. And I feel like an even bigger fool for being so nice as to not be able to stick up for myself when I wanted to escape. I have a hard time believing he thought 100% I was actually enjoying myself by the way he would look and treat me. But he is such a strong tall military guy and I'm short fat and weak so I could not actually stop him from doing these things. But if I said no go away he probably would have if not sulking like when we were young. But than if he could act this differently than before maybe not? I knew he would be a douche but I felt kinda helpess and hurt though I could have stoped it idk. Should have. I was like a man handled ragdoll. And he knew for a fact I was not into bdsm type stuff cuz right before we were talking about movies scrolling by on netflix and he mentioned the 50 Shades movie and I said it was dumb and would never do that stuff..

But its not like he assaulted me though cuz I consented. I didn't consent to the bad stuff but I couldn't say no either though and I tried and did start kicking and making like ""stop noises"". Which he ignored and made it worse.

&amp;#x200B;

Lost story short my throat and neck hurt and I feel like a disgusting piece if slutty meat now when yesterday I felt like a happy content nun watching my cartoons with my cat.   


I feel violated and hurt. But I smiled and let him continue so it could be over faster. Plus I didn't wana make him mad or sonething. Not that I was afraid he'd hit me just I hate disappointing people. But maybe I should have been afraid and I am really disapointed in myself.

&amp;#x200B;

Today my neck feels tight kind of. I thought my anxiety was just making it feel that way. And sore throat is a given. But I just did a short workout and I can feel the blood pulse and rush through my neck and its really unerving and I hate it and now my neck feels like its still being strangled a little but I have no bruise. Can breathe fine despite soreness in my throat. But the internet said people can drop dead days after even a little bit of that. Im scared. Id rather die than humiliate myself with going to the doctor and explaining it and since I cant drive Id have to explain to my master at belittling me sister to get there. But has anyone else felt this? Will it get better? Its just still fresh and maybe a little bruised inside? Google is giving me visions of my blood vessels snapping, strokes or esophagus being partially crushed without realizing it. Though   
I'm eating fine Id rather not randomly die in a few days. The sensation is just bothering me mentally bad.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice?

&amp;#x200B;

For the record Im just going to stick to dream men for the rest of my life. Im not someone who trusts easily and now I realize its not worth even involving myself with anyone. Even more so when Im broken sexually and cant feel stuff anyway. I literally just did it as an experiment and to make him happy so I could get some hugs from a human being. I feel so gross now like my body and mouth are contaminated and I should not touch anything, eat food, or kiss even my cats or family now like I will spread the nastiness of what I did to things I love.

I feel stupid for posting this,"I'm a 34 year old guy who lost his job to covid, living with parents who are emotionally and mentally abusing me. The threat of physical violence is certainly a spectre, but fortunately they have only hit me once since I was a teenager.

Like the title suggests, I know that I'm in a position of privilege compared to many others out there, but this really sucks.

I spend 20 hours in 'my room' per day because they are so miserable to be around. If I go to the kitchen to eat I get harassed for example. That is the absolute lightest of examples. Sometimes they fight and hit each other. When they fight they use any excuse to hide what they did, or they tell me that it was my fault.

I pretty much have no social interactions besides going to the grocery store.

I don't have the financial means to move out. I've got a spazzy dog, and I'm in a mid sized Northwest city where housing costs are absolutely ridiculous even without pet deposits. I've considered giving the dog away, but that is a heartbreaking thought when you have nothing and no friends.

I don't know what to do.",domesticviolence
Vent but advice/knowledge is appreciated. My best friend is suffering DV with her partner.,"My main questions are at the bottom if you just wanna skim. 
I'll try not to make this longer than it needs to be. 
My best friend (20 f) is in an abusive relationship &amp; its getting worse, they've been together for three years &amp; it's all abuse expect for sexual (that I'm aware of). She already has a lot going on with uni &amp; trying to improve her mental health, I don't want her to stay in this relationship while it just gets worse &amp; worse &amp; by the time she leaves.. If she does... She has even more, harder, stuff to work on.
The problem is, I'm a teenager &amp; I also live in a different state to her. She's come to stay with me before when things were bad but that was only for a week so she could have a “break“.
As you can tell, I'm a bit helpless.
I've offered to her for her to come live with me &amp; my family permanently as my family has been thru domestic violence &amp; we have given people a place to stay many times. My offer wasn't long ago &amp; I told her i/we could help her move up her around January time so she could have time to change unis &amp; settle in, that stuff. She just seems really reluctant to really take on help or even help herself as harsh as that sounds because she is so used to living in a DV situation (she moved in with her bfs family almost two years ago to get away from her families abuse) &amp; she also has bpd which makes leaving very hard to put it simple, if you have bpd is you get what I mean. Plus she has no friends or family there that she can go with. She only has me &amp; some of my friends up here.

I've spoken to my mum about it &amp; she told me I need to be straightforward with my friend which I have been because as we all know this is so serious &amp; dangerous &amp; friends have to be honest with eachother regardless. She told me I need to tell my friend to search for resources &amp; shelerts &amp; for her not to tell anyone (of course) &amp; reassure her that people will help her because of the situation she's in. I've told her this all. I've even given her resources to look into but she just won't take it. She's scared too &amp; I asked her how isn't she more scared to stay in this situation? He's only bringing her down &amp; he will only get worse. He's a manipulater &amp; he's gaslighting you. I said stuff like that in a caring way.she comes to me for support mostly &amp; I know that I can't “save“ her, she needs to save herself but it's honestly scary &amp; I don't want her to end up dead which is worst case situation. 

What can I do to help my friend? I know she has to want to help herself but what are some resources I can at least recommend to her (shelters, support groups, therapy centres ect) that might help her make the first step? She lives in West Melbourne Victoria AUS. what would you say if this was your friend to try to convince them? What would you do? Any knowledge/advice is welcomed.",domesticviolence
How can I help my friend?,"I have a friend who has been suffering abuse at the hands of her addict husband. She is scared to leave as he has told her if she attempts to he will kill the entire family (she has four kids). He has been tormenting the kids as well, physically and mentally. 

Recently she has started posting about things that have been happening as well as a couple of pictures of damage that he has done. 

I want to call the cops but I’m nervous if I call when he is sober they won’t do anything and he will retaliate. 

I’m currently on the other side of the country so I don’t know when he is sober and when he is drunk. Will the cops still do something if he is sober?",domesticviolence
"I caught my biggest worry on tape, can anybody actually help? (UK based)","I'm a 23 year old homeowner (female). I'm selling my house, the house I was abused in for over a year. I'm currently detaching from my partner and working on healing but occasionally he comes back (he moved back with his dad just 5 miles away), lets himself in, etc. I let it happen and try avoid conflict because I know that until the house is sold, because we're so close geographically, I'm not safe.

This man has no care for the law, does what he wants, thinks he's above the law and isn't bothered about facing the police, punishment, or even jail time. If I fully broke things off with him now he would definitely, 100%, destroy the house and make it unsellable (at least to the current buyer who has a mortgage) - or at the very least keep me here much longer and closer to him! He wants to control my life.

So I will sell, and run. I have a buyer so within a couple of months I should be outta here, woooo! That said, I'm a young entrepreneur and own my home outright. He did some renovation work when we moved in, maybe £2-4k worth. We were in a happy relationship at this time and never discussed payment. Legally, he's entitled to nothing.

That said, he expects 50% (around £50,000). I have a voice recording of him saying:

&gt;'whatever you get from here, half of that is going in my account, which is payment for building this fucking shithole, that's taken up 3 years of my life with you, you miserable fucking piece of shit. if you don't, I will dedicate the rest of my fucking life to killing you, you fucking asshole'.

I will be moving back to nearer my hometown, about 40 miles away, but it's just a short train ride away. How can I get help and protect myself? I only have unclear images of physical abuse (I think because I'm so pale the camera doesn't pick up well, and he's never left bruises or serious marks/cuts), the only thing I have as hard 'evidence' is the recording - so even if I tried to press charges the highest charge he'd get is common assault? Even then, for a common assault offence to have taken place, the threat must be immediate, so the charge would fail.

What am I supposed to do to ensure my safety? The police in the UK are awful at protecting people, and so many domestic abuse victims die \*after\* the relationship ended. What can be done?",domesticviolence
My partner (44M) has just been arrested for repeatedly punching me (23F) in the face and stealing my phone,"Title is self explanatory. To give you an idea of my partner, he had already been in prison twice for domestic violence previously and has spent approx 14 years in prison for a myriad of offences in total. 
 My first boyfriend, 21 years my senior and the first man who spontaneously opened up the capacity for romantic love for the opposite sex after a life time of sexual violence, has just been arrested for domestic violence; finally. 

He was the person who taught me what it meant to ‘light up a room’ through free expression of his effervescent charisma, whilst also being the person who made me walk on egg shells for fear he would permanently scar or kill me. 

He’s threatened to throw acid in my face, kill me in a multitude of ways (such as ‘stab/slice me up and leave me begging for mercy’), kick my head in on multiple occasions, arrange for people in my town 20 years older and in his 40-odd year old age bracket to beat me up. He’s called up the organisation who manages where I live and tried to intentionally make me homeless by telling them discriminatory and incriminating information about me. I’ve trusted him with information that I have never told anyone, running along the theme of childhood sexual abuse, just for him to turn around and use that information as golden ammunition to assassinate, blackmail me with, and threaten to post all over Facebook. 

He’s hyper possessive, jealous, and up until now only been emotionally and mentally abusive. He has had me genuinely believe I wasn’t worth shit and that I really was a fat, useless whore who no one else would want which were words repeatedly uttered from his lips. That ‘my pussy wasn’t worth shit’, and that I really was ‘shit in bed’ amongst other things. 

He was like Jekyll and Hyde, night and day. It was very confusing having my best friend and lover to be so nasty and full of cruel hate.  

Well I really tried to avoid getting the police involved and even called up his probation officer as a professional alternative after he threatened to throw acid in my face and tried to make me homeless - hoping he perhaps could speak some sense into him. 
Well today it finally happened, the next step on his linear progression of abuse: after yet again accusing me of sleeping with a vast array of people, (which has never been true), he got up, walked over to the bed which I was sitting and planted three punches to my face and jaw. I started screaming, so he picked up a pillow and started telling me to shut the fuck up - I watched his face calculate his thought process as he proceeded to pick up a large glass bottle. 
‘Is this guy going to finally kill me by smothering me with this pillow he’s grasping? Or is he going to hit me with this bottle instead?’ I thought - I honestly didn’t care, I just carried on screaming as to set off an alarm for the neighbour next door. 

She let me call the police on her phone after he had decorated my face and stole my phone before running from the building. The police came and they asked me a million questions - not just about the current event, but our general dynamic and concluded that they wanted to prosecute him also with coercive control. 
As I was doing my statement, he turned up back at the house with a face like a slapped arse and an apology. He looked poignant and remorseful as the police snapped him in handcuffs, “you’re not going to press charges are you babe?” he asked.
Truth is that I don’t know, but I’m gutted that I’ve lost my best friend and partner. 
He’s on license as he came out of prison in July last year, so chances are he’ll be recalled and’ll be going back there for a few months to complete his sentence behind bars. 
Lost, confused, lonely and gutted.

Is my(33f) husband(34m) verbally/emotionally abusing me? If so what do i do now?....,"Im pretty sure that my,(33f) husband(34m) is verbally and emotionally abusive and im looking for some reassurance. Whenever we have any sort of conflict he always says things that I think are really mean. In the past he has called me ""crazy bitch"" ""dumb bitch"" ""psycho"" ""dummy"" ""retarded"" ""child"" most recently he got angry because I didn't put something away and started berating me for it because the kids got into it. I said ""ok"" and he said ""its like talking to a fucking wall!"" When i confront him about being so mean he says ""i was mad you dont have to nice when you're mad!"" so basically he thinks when you're angry and in an argument you can say anything you want. On top of that i feel like I never live up to his expectations. Before lockdown our baby gate broke off the wall(it was used and had constant use) that same day i accidentally broke the coffee pot(also used) instead of writing them both off as accidents he lectured me on and on about how "" i need to be more careful with our thongs so we can keep them longer, because we want to have nice things right?!"" I tried to explain that it was just an accident about the coffee pot and accidents happen. ""He said it's not a fucking accident! It didn't spontaneously brake! You broke it!"" I just shut down after that but he went on and on about how I dont want to be ""better"" or ""change"" and how he watches me and sees how careless and rough I am and how I dont listen to how things are ""supposed"" to be used like using metal utensils on nonstick pans. Also the other morning he couldn't find any clean work pants. He had been off for almost 2 weeks due to covid but im a SAHM and do all the laundry. He got so pissed he didn't have clean pants he punched a whole in the wall and didnt speak to me the whole day even when he got home. I got angry at this very entitled outburst and his excuse was that he ""represents"" our family and that im making him look bad. Also that our children always have full drawers of laundry and he always ""comes in last."" Again he was off for 2 weeks and could have done his own laundry and our children cant do their own laundry. Im at loss and writing this all out has made it all the more clear that im not crazy. Is this abuse? If so what should i do when he starts to get angry the next time in the moment? Where do I go from here? Is it worth it to try to go to couples counseling or should i just move on? We have two young children and I just want to do what's best for them but divorce sounds very very scary still.",domesticviolence
Why is it so difficult to see it as abusive?,"I dont know if I need validation or what. The other day we were talking and I got up to go inside because I was getting annoyed and he grabbed my wrist until I sat back down. When we both went inside I told him that he can't do stuff like that to me and he said that he could do whatever he wants and grabbed me by my hair and kept saying, ""Do you understand?"" Wouldn't let go until I said yes. This isn't the first time he's grabbed me by my hair when I've told him he can't do something to me and wouldn't let go until I repeated what he wanted me to say. 


When I confront him that this is abusive he says it's just a joke and he isn't serious and he's just playing around with me. Then he apologized and said he didn't realize it felt abusive or felt ""real"" to me and he wouldn't play around with me like that or act so rough with me. Today he's been nothing but sweet and kind. When I read back what I wrote I know it sounds bad and if someone told me their husband did this to them I'd be shocked and tell them how wrong it was. So why am I always questioning and second guessing myself and wondering if I'm overreacting?",domesticviolence
Trouble understanding the language to use to describe abuse.,"I [30F] had a tough childhood. I consider my dad to be an emotionally abusive man, but it was not his fault. I forgave him long ago and have a lot of empathy now. When I was a junior in high school I had 0 self esteem and severe anxiety because of my dad. It was then that I met my ex fiancee (let's call him Chad).

Chad was charming at first. We were happy. I was head over heels for him until we went to college. Then he started to withdraw. He wouldn't visit me (I went to a school about 2 hours from him). He was emotionally unavailable. I was a freshman. I had no self esteem. I was lost. I transferred to be with him (it was a much better school and I have no regrets for other reasons). The relationship took an even more toxic turn. He would pressure me to have sex with other women (I am bisexual but am not so into the multiple partners at the same time thing). He would pressure me into threesomes. He was a habitual cheater. He was constantly encouraging me to fuck other people I didn't want to fuck so he could feel better about doing it behind my back. All the while he reminded me constantly how worthless I was, and how lucky I was he loved me because no one else ever would. There was at least one night when he pressured me I to sex I absolutely did not want, and I cried a lot after.

Then we got engaged and moved. He graduated college late and wanted to go to law school. He moved to be with me and contributed 0 to the household. I had 3 jobs for a while to keep us afloat while he played go on the internet. He refused to take me on dates. He was terrible with money and wouldn't let me spend anything myself, but would buy gadgets often. He refused to get a job. But still I was lucky to have him. 

He started to pressure me to have sex with my girlfriends, either alone or in front of him. He would find other women and pressure me into sleeping with them. I contracted an STD from one of these encounters. He went on dates with other women and told me about them. He tried to fuck my friends. He had a mistress who was a friend's ex (this happened a lot) who he fucked for years. He didn't try to hide it. He often told me how much better she was than me. He started law school, did terribly at it, and reminded me constantly that I was the reason he was failing.

He wanted me to be something sexually that I wasn't. He would dress me up in BDSM lingerie and clothes. He would complain I wasn't sexy enough or didn't meet his needs. He told me what to wear. He constantly demeaned my looks or clothing choices. By the end he was telling me to wear sexual clothes that made me uncomfortable.

I should have left, but he told me that I promised to love him unconditionally. I though no one would want me. That I was disgusting. I stayed for 10 years. I believed I was worthless. I only got out because I developed a crush that let me see things more clearly (he did not like me back). 

Now I'm married to a great guy but I feel cut off from him and totally numb. We made some unrelated mistakes. He was selfish early on and steamrolled me. I didn't have a voice. He NEVER would do anything to hurt me. But I feel so numb.

Can anyone help me describe what my ex was and did? He never hit me, so I never understood what was happening as abuse.  Everything I try to use to talk about it feels wrong. I feel like if I name it I can start dealing with it. Also any resources for healing would be greatly appreciated.",domesticviolence
Hello. I need some help.,Hello. I need some help. My best friend is in a really bad domestic violence relationship. She is codependent and suffering. We stopped talking after her first son was born because she started being rude and I decided I didn't need that in my life but started talking a year ago. Something told my gut to get ahold of her and sure enough my gut was right. I don't need to tell everything but I can say that he has tied to kill her and he was arrested and bailed out the next day by his parents. She didn't get the proper help she needed by the victims advocate and lied about that happened even though she had hand marks around her neck. He has said he was going to kill her and her 2 kids several times. So one time she I didn't hear from her for a month and I begged her to just tell me she was ok that's all I needed to know. She agreed and said sorry. So I fucked up I got upset another month went by I left her text messages voice mail and nothing back. I got upset because I been working so hard to help her and get her help I fucked up and sent her some messages I regret nothing mean just how my feelings are hurt and I love her and always are there for her and all I asked for her is to tell me she was alright. She was getting on Instagram and sharing videos so why couldn't she just send a small response. Before we talked almost 5 times a week. Now she is not responding I haven't heard anything. I have called left voicemail again I have begged her to talk to me. I have been working with a victims advocate to get help to help her. She hasn't posted anything no activity in 2 weeks. What should I do stop trying to get ahold of her let it go. Call for a wellness check. Contact her brother tell him what's going on. Btw she hasn't told anyone what's really going on she was a foster child and doesn't have parents or a supportive family just her brother she talks to. The husband family is in denial and blames both of them for the so called drama and doesn't realize she is in deep danger. I had been working with a detective about 6 months ago to get enough evidence to charge him with attempted murder and we had everything but her statement that's all he needed. but he does tell her all the time how he's going to kill her and the kids drive off a cliff drive into the barrier he's going to kill himself he's already shot a gun in the house with the kids.

"My mum's husband tried to kill me, and I don't know what to do.","I'm F16 (soon to be 17 in a month) from England and my mum has been married to a man since 2017/2018, who has been abusive emotionally and physically. I live separately from them in my grandma's house with her friend (he take care of her). I'm writing this at 2am while crying, so it might lack detail/not correct wording - ask questions if you need.

After they got married, they had a baby daughter. Before she was born, I remember my mum coming home early in the morning after being out all night. I was staying up for her, and when she came home she was crying. It got a lot of asking, but she told me that he punched her in the stomach (she was 2 months into the pregnancy).

After that incident, something else happened. I'm not sure clearly about what did, but she had accidently cut him after he tried to grab a knife from her in the kitchen (he was drunk) which resulted in him having a big cut on his finger. He called the police, and before they came, he began throwing death threats at me (I was in the living room and he was at the door of it yelling at mr). He told me that if I didn't get out of the house when he returned (from the hospital), that he would kill me and my whole family. This might have happened after the police came, but I'm not sure. He also yelled at me, calling me things like bitch, slut, etc. My grandma came to pick me up. He never apologised, but my mum forgave him.

Nothing really happened for the two years, apart from him continually yelling things at my mum like bitch, slut, saying she was useless, telling her not to do certain things, etc. I also remember him threatening to kick my mum out of the house, when they lived in their old house. He would always hit me, jab me with his hand in a way, but play it off as a joke.

Something else happened last month though. Me, my mum, and my little sister (around 1 year and 3 months old) had went out and we came back to their new house. The house is one floor, it was a living room, bathroom, kitchen, and bedroom. When he came home, he began drinking. Me and my mum went to the bedroom, to put my little sister to sleep, while he was in the living room. My little sister was crying a lot, but we still tried to put her to sleep. She's quite stubborn, lol. I took her from my mum, and had her on my upper body, trying to make her sleep. He came into the bedroom, and tried to take her away from me. I said that it was okay and that I can get her to sleep, but he still tried to take her away from me. At first he was just trying to take her, but then he began to grab my hands really hard and sort of jab them (like he was trying to dig his nails into my hands, but with his fingers?) but I kept persistenting. He became more violent in doing it, until he took his hand and put it around my neck, really hard, and began squeezing it until I could barely breathe and felt my vision going away a bit. I called the police. While I was on the phone with them, I was in the kitchen and he was in the living room (they're opposite from the house), he kept yelling at me saying he was going to kill me by cutting/stabbing me, he kept calling me things like bitch, slut, he kept saying that he didnt want a disabled person in the house (I'm blind in one eye), he kept saying to me to leave and that this would be the last time I would be in the house. When the police came after 10 minutes, I explained what happen and told them about the incident of where he threatened me. They asked questions on his previous behaviour, and I told them. They said that the only thing they could do is take me home.

After the incident, I kept having suicidal thoughts. I also had thoughts that he was going to come to me and kill me, like he would find me in the street and bash my head against the pavement, or how he was going to come to my house and kill me. As it's my birthday in a month, my mum told me she was going to come to my house with him and my sister to give me cake. I told her I didnt want him to come, and she asked me why. I told her how he made me feel, about the thoughts I had. She told me to think about how hard it was for her to bring the cake while with my little sister. I told her I also self harm because of it, and she told me I did it before what he did (this is true, but I also did it after/as result of what he did). She doesnt try to help me, and she keeps on defending him by saying he was angry, or how he has problems with his job, etc (this is also the same for when he threaten me the first time). She told me she would help me, and that she loved me more than him. My grandma bashes me for it, after what happen I didnt leave me room for a week/eat and she keeps saying about how it affected her. Because my mum bring my sister for us to take care of her when she work, he has to come and pick her up after 4PM. I leave to go upstairs so I dont have to see him, and my grandma said ""you're leaving like someone will hurt you"" (I'm not sure how to translate it).

My mum says she cant leave him because she doesn't want to live in my grandmas house ""under control"", and how she wont have money if she leaves (she has job, but I dont think it give much money)

No one is on my side. My family won't help me. Please help me, I dont want to die.",domesticviolence
Suggestions for serving divorce papers.,"
I met with a lawyer. I’m still in the planning stages of filing for divorce. I hope a position opens up near my parents several hours away so I can transfer near them with my employer. But with COVID and ability to work from home, I may not need to do that even.

I don’t want to have my husband served while at work.  The lawyer said I can just tell him that I’m filing and my lawyer just needs to know where to serve him and then suggest he obtain a lawyer and the lawyer can serve him divorce papers through his lawyer. 

We have child so it will need to go through mediation and requires 90 day waiting period so I don’t want to wait too much  longer. It would be easier if the children were back in school to have this conversation with him. But with COVID, I’m also scared to have this conversation with him while home alone.  So at this rate, I probably won’t file until end of August.

(Husband hurt me and threatened me for the first time a couple of months ago after 15 + years of marriage /together)

Any other suggestions?",domesticviolence

Family member abusing pregnant girlfriend,"Hello. As the title says, I have a family member that is physically, emotionally, and verbally abusive towards his 8.5 month pregnant girlfriend. The rest of the family is feeling pretty hopeless as ""she is the one that instigates it"" and ""they really should just break up"" and ""it's not our place to intervene"". 

He is an addict and abuses steroids, and his mood swings are explosive and dangerous. He strangles her at family dinners, hits, screams at, and threatens her, and has pushed her out of moving vehicles more than once (all while pregnant). 

It is not hyperbolic to expect that he will one day kill her and/or their child without intervention. Is there a way for me to anonymously report him? I know that it can often make things worse getting the police involved in cases of domestic violence, but I can't stand by and do nothing.",domesticviolence
That time of the year again,"Would you believe me if I say I document it? In a little green book hidden amongst hundreds of others. I try to correlate dates to see if the events have significance, I'm yet to find anything. It is random but it happens at least once a year.

Hair scraped back into a low bun, fingers bitten painfully short - collectively these numb the senses to what is felt elsewhere. Loose clothing and cold cream soothe the bruising, blood can be wiped away traceless but the throbbing never dulls away; these are my life lessons.

Sometimes I think I am lucky, God gifted me with poor sight. Once the glasses get knocked off it's all a blur ... literally.

The difficulty lies in dealing with the aftermath, helplessly running fingers across the wooden floor; porcelain, crystal glass and dirt those are my finds that day. Then something cold comes into touch, round and wired it sits lifeless, waiting for me patiently. I pull myself forward and place the cool wiring against my burning cheeks - the world comes into focus.

It all happens behind closed doors, hushed away and stifled.
Did I mention the raging episodes are mainly once a year? 
So I shouldn't exaggerate or worry, others have it worse - is how I incessantly console myself.

The next morning rolls in, my eyes wide open before the sun has a chance to shine its rays. I put on my scrubs and clammer around to grab my bag as I fumble with the door lock; my hospital ID softly swings around the nape of my neck. 

The bright lights in the ED stun the remaining sleep I have as I deal with the influx of patients destined to meet me that day. They come with hope, stories of their own and issues bigger than mine. 
So I don my mask, the happy one, and lift my heavy head high.

8 years of abusive marriage,"
This is my life story.

I am 30 year old female living in india. I got married At 22. It was an arrange marriage. After marriage I started noticing that my husband gets angry very quickly for small things like why snacks are not ready when he reaches home from office. Why there there is less salt in food. As I got married straight out the college I dint know cooking at all. I was learning to cook after marriage. But I adjusted to all that and learned to cook soon. Bit he still would complain that I don't cook like his mom. I should learn from his mother.  When he gets angry and shouts at me his language becomes very bad and will abuse me verbally. 

I had told all this to my mother, she told me its OK its alright, just don't make him angry. Behave nicely with him do everything for him. Keep him happy. 

After 1 year of marriage his mother started asking for kids. Before getting married he had suggested that we will wait for 3 years after marriage I had also agreed to it as I dint wanted to have kids immediately.
But when his mother started asking him, he started to force me for it. As I was taking contraceptive pills. He forced me to stop taking those. But I asked him to give me some time, give me 3 months I will get my health in good condition as i was anemic, so that in 3 months i can improve my haemoglobin level and then try for pregnancy. He dint agree for it and forced me to have sex without my consent. I was crying all the time and he started to shout at me saying what are u crying for, you are crying as if I raped you. 

After a month I got pregnant. But that pregnancy resulted in miscarriage.
Once the miscarriage happened his mother blamed me stating that as I was taking contraceptive pills, I got miscarriage and I am not fit to bear children. He also agreed to it and that resulted in big fight. My parents also got involved, his parents also got involved. The fight was big. He had clearly told that you cannot come back until your parents apologize to my parents, as your parents have spoken a lot about me.
I tried to make him understand as we have married we should try to work on the relationship if parents are having a fight let them have there fights should not affect our relationship.
In spite of him saying don't come. I went to stay with him, after I went thats when the physical abuse started. The first time he hit me I told my mom about it she said is ok it happened only once, it won't happen again. Then I got pregnant.  But the verbal abuse was still present. Once my daughter was born. Physically hitting me, shouting at me, forcing me to have sex. Even if I say no he would force me to do it. While I am sleeping he would come and remove my pants and do sex with me. When I question him for such kind of behavior he says he does it for relaxation purpose. All this continued. When my daughter was 5 years he hit me a lot. Thats when I took my daughter and went to parents place. Told my parents that i am not going back to that house and i want a divorce. But my parents never believed me they say that I should adjust and live there. They thought I was depressed and they took me for counselling so that I do not talk about divorce and go back there. My parents also physically hit me, and they sent my daughter to husband's house. When I question my parents they say that I do not deserve to a mother. They say that in every marriage there is violence you should learn to adjust for your daughter. My parents took away my money and then they forced me to go back to that house. I told them clearly that I will not live in that house I will go away some where else. But they said we don't care what you do but you should go back to that house.
they sent me back. I lived at my husband house for 1 month then I left the house. Sent an email to police and to husband stating that I am leaving the house. I took up a job in another city and I am living in a hostel now.

Now I am preparing for divorce and custody of my daughter.
 But at times I feel guilty that I left my daughter in that house.

So lonely,"I feel so alone and depressed. I can’t talk to anyone my church...I’m too embarrassed. I can’t talk to a therapist because I have children and they have to report abuse if there are children present in the home. He has never hurt our children.

I read stories on here about abusers and I feel like no one is in the same situation as me. Sometimes we go years without an incident. I can’t tear my children’s lives apart for my safety. They are so happy and have no idea. 

I’m starting to feel like a shell of a person. Like an extension of him. I agree with his every opinion to keep the peace. 

I feel like I will never be happy. That maybe I can leave when the kids are grown.",domesticviolence

Restraining order expired and he is posting videos of me again, I had a case of sexual assault and domestic violence against my ex-bf two years ago. He plead to a lesser charge and received probation. I was able to get a restraining order that lasted until this month. Today I came across videos he posted two days ago of me and us during our time together two years ago. They are not sexual but he is captioning them with harassing statements and calling me crazy. I do not want to report them on the website because he will know I have seen them and he is looking for attention. I wish I would have extended my order of protection before it expired. Does anyone know if I would have any luck applying for a new order or any other course of action I could take to stop the harassment?,domesticviolence
PhD research to increase safety of victims,"My name is Thomas Nally and I am a PhD student with the University of Central Lancashire (UCLan) and a forensic psychologist in training. I am conducting a study examining how victims in abusive relationships protect themselves.

As an individual with lived experience, you would provide valuable insights into behaviours and strategies used to reduce or prevent the risk of abuse. You are invited to take part in this research if you have been a victim of an abusive relationship in the past, but are not in an abusive relationship at the moment.

If you decide to participate in this study, you will be asked to complete an interview, using skype/zoom or a telephone. This interview will ask you about safety strategies you have used and factors that may help us understand why these strategies are used. You will not be identified in the write up of the findings.

I’ve Never Told Anyone About My Abuse,"I am 20F and have never told anyone about what happened to me. I could not accept what was happening in the moment so I ignored it. I was in a relationship where I was being physically and emotionally abused. 

My best friend assumed I was sneaking around with her ex behind her back and blocked me everywhere, I tried to talk to her but she never answered. This same guy got close to me and wanted me to be with him, and I never wanted to be, but it quickly developed into an emotionally and physically abusive relationship. I needed my friends the most at the time in my life but I had to go through it alone (some other friends had decided to side with my best friend).

I cannot believe I stayed in such a shitty relationship because I consider myself to be very independent and not submissive. He had me wrapped around his finger and I found myself changing and bending my morals just to be with him. 

I told myself the slapping, choking and biting was just a kink of his. I told him he was hurting me but he insisted on doing these things because he would be aroused. The biting hurt so much that I would silently scream, just waiting for the moment to be over. When he slapped me, I felt so worthless. I found myself holding on because I was so scared to let go. 
I feared how he would react if I left him. I stayed in this toxic relationship for half a year until he decided that I wasn’t good enough for him and dumped me. 

I’ve been trying to self heal, but I think that I need to talk to someone about this so I can get past it.",domesticviolence

**HELP**
So I ran with my four children in the middle of the night to get away from my abusive husband. My friend picked us up and took us two hours and 45 mins away to her house to be safe. I have a preemie who is 7 pounds now ..a two year old...9 year old...and 12 year old. Apparently in the midst of grabbing everything from the house I forgot my wic Similac neosure for my baby and I just ran COMPLETELY out and no money to buy any and I honestly do not know what to do..I'm so scared. My friend who we moved in with is out of funds and I have no family. I called the pediatricians around here and none have any samples and hospital says they have a shortage for labor and delivery only right now. I am at a loss and so scared...anyone have any ideas because I'm out of all...oh the two local food banks here do not have ANY formula...idk I need prayers and help

I just want to give up but I know I can not do that because I am all that my four babies have. Especially now that I left and pretty much us 5 is all we have.. we have no other family and the only friend that we have is the one that is allowing us to live with her until we can get on our feet to get our own house. 

I just feel so hopeless and useless because I cannot even provide for my own children what kind of mother am I? Maybe I shouldn't have left or maybe I should go back and just deal with it for the well being of my children I do not know what to do or what to think I honestly just feel like a failure what I mean is I have failed as a mother... A wife..and  just a woman in general!! 

I CALLED SIMILAC AND THEY ARE GOING TO SEND ME SOME FORMULA BUT IT TAKES AROUND 14 DAYS TO PROCESS THE ORDER THEN THEY SHIP IT OUT SO THE LADY ON THE PHONE SAID I CAN EXPECT IT AROUND 20 TO 30 DAYS OR A MONTH PRETTY MUCH. I ALSO CALLED WIC TWICE ACTUALLY, AND TALK TO TWO DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND EXPLAINED MY SITUATION AND THEY CHECKED AND THEY HAVE NO SAMPLES OR EXTRAS OF ANY KIND OF FORMULA.  THEY GAVE ME THE SOONEST APPOINTMENT THEY COULD WHICH IS THIS COMING THURSDAY. BUT I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT SOMETHING NOW BECAUSE WE ARE COMPLETELY OUT OF THE SIMILAC NEOSURE NOW. I HAVE NONE TO GIVE MY SON SO I HAVE BEEN CALLING MESSAGING AND DOING EVERYTHING I CAN THINK OF TO AT LEAST COME UP WITH THE $24 TO BUY A CAN TO AT LEAST LAST TILL WIC APPOINTMENT THURSDAY. 

I HAD ASKED ALL MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY THE LOAN ME SOME MONEY OR TO EVEN SEND A VIRTUAL GIFT CARD AND I TOLD THEM I WOULD PAY THEM BACK FRIDAY AT MIDNIGHT TRIPLE THE AMOUNT. WHICH PRETTY MUCH MEANS THAT FOR $25 I WAS OFFERING TO GIVE THEM $75 AND THE LAST 2 PEOPLE I ASKED I TOLD THEM I WOULD PAY THEM BACK $100 FOR THE 25 AND NO SUCCESS YET BUT I CAN'T GIVE UP I HAVE TO FIGURE THIS OUT ASAP.",domesticviolence

Is this verbal or emotional abuse or am I overreacting?,"Not sure if what I'm experiencing could be verbal or emotional abuse? My husband tends to snap at me a lot. Not even in moments of stress, but in every day conversation, like harsh, aggressive tone, etc. In the past I've told him that it starts to affect my self-esteem and makes me wonder what's wrong with me and why can't he just speak to me nicely. For several months he was working on it and it stopped being a problem, but since the pandemic started he's started to do it again more often on a day to day basis. 


The last time it happened was last week. We were eating and he had to suddenly run into work and all I did was remind him of something related to his job he had told me about earlier. This led to him snapping at me that he already knew, etc. When he got home he apologized, but then got mad at me because I was still upset??? and said why can't he apologize and we just move on? It was hard for me to immediately move on because the snapping was happening every single day leading up to that incident. Like at that point it was the culmination of being snapped at day after day. He didn't get it at first but then he ended up apologizing again and explained he was stressed with work and took it out on me and was sorry. But then he added that I push him and he felt like I was ""challenging him"" when I said the work reminder, which is why he snapped at me. It feels like he started with an apology for his behavior but then put the blame on me? He said he would continue to work on it and since last week we haven't had any issues but idk. I wasn't trying to push him or challenge him and just wanted to remind him of something. I just dont get what I did that was so wrong? Any advice helps. I did kind of confront him that it feels kind of abusive sometimes when this happens and he started asking, ""Do you really think I'm an abuser?"" and saying how hurt he was that I'd even say that and then I felt guilty for thinking that.",domesticviolence
Im stupid. How long to feel better after minor strangulation?,"Maybe this doesnt belong here Im not sure where to label this since Im kinda confused.   


I have to spill my sin and I think it might qualify as some level of borderline abuse and could really use some advice. Its a graphic story of what just happened though so please don't read if your sensitive.   
My overall question though if you don't want to read id how long does it take you to feel better after ""minor"" strangulation?

&amp;#x200B;

I feel way to embarassed to go to my Dr about this and Im a hypochondriac so maybe Im thinking to much on it.

&amp;#x200B;

Im 29, really fat and partially blind so I don't get out much. I have a pretty face but not much else. I have no friends and my idea of a wet dream is when dream men hold my hand. My family has been belittling me about being almost 30 with no friends, boyfriend or life pretty much since my birthday. Though I just finally graduated college with my BA.🤷🏻‍♀️

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway an ex hit me up the other day. Like the last guy I ever dated eight years ago. He was a charming douche but I still kinda had fun with him and he was the first guy I had more than one consensual sexual encounter with at 22. Even though Iv never really liked it and he would always say ""your welcome"" after like ge did me the favor so I dumped him.

&amp;#x200B;

But yesterday I was desperate and dumb and here was some rare attention so I cleaned up my apartment, got as nice looking as I could and he came over saying he would only stay for like a half hour and talk and stuff cuz I told him I might not feel the best. But I really liked the feeling of being hugged and cuddled. Its not something   
I ever get to feel and he knows how pathetic I am so I know he used that to charm me. And so my dumb brain turned off and I gave in to his advances. I thought this time I would be assertive and a strong women and try not to care about my fat body while he had a nice one. Plus I had ovarian surgery last year and haven't been able to reach orgasm since (though never had issues before blah) and thought I would try once with a person instead of myself to see if it could fix me.   
It was ok at first. Though he is kinda on the small penis end he is a huge guy. Back in the day he always begged me for blow jobs and I never gave in because I told him it reminded me of bad stuff I went through as a kid and grosses me out. But 29 year old me has been through therapy and wanted to be confident so I did it and that's when I noticed he wasn't simply douchy like long ago he started saying a lot of degrading things to me and forcing my arms and head to do things even when I tried to pull away. Then when he tried normal way out of nowhere he started strangling me. Im 5ft2 and he is 6ft3 with large hands and it shocked me a lot. I started struggling and he just squeezed harder. I never passed out and could kinda breath tiny kinda trying to kick him off. but my veins felt really restricted. He's really strong so I could not move his hands. But he let up and I was too shocked to say anything but then he kept randomly doing it off and on. I am not sure if I froze and thats why I didnt have the courage to end it there. But I am a people pleaser I guess and he had driven far so I felt bad and didn't want to disappoint him or irritate him. At that point I just was screaming in my head for it to end and starting thinking of scape options like how to make him happy so it will stop in my head but I still pretended to enjoy it a little and pretended everything was fine and pretended to be the confident woman like I had read about trying to be. And then he put a pillow over my head and was preasing down on my mouth area. When I freed my mouth gasping for air he fought me to keep it on and kept trying to stop me breathing and it took me a couple minutes to get it away. Or felt that way. Then he acted like he was all nice and tried touching me and holding me down so I pretended to like it so it would be over faster. But it wasn't and he forced my head to do other things that were a lot more painful and degrading than the how to articals described. I did managed a loud awkward no with one disgusting unforgivable reqest and keep my head away despite the yanking till he moved on. So I was kinda panicking now inside but still trying to make him happy so he would finish and leave. Heck I even smiled and laughed awkwardly trying to talk about things when I got the chance to breath freely but he kept telling me to shut up. Though I know he knew he was hurting me at times because when I couldn't hold the fake enjoyment it made him happier and he strangled me a few more times randomly even though I was clawing and kicking at him. By the end I just did what he wanted plastered a fake smile on my face because if he would just be done it would stop. At least that was my thinking. When it was over, after he said he would just finish ""on me"" but then forced it in my mouth to do it there, nasty grossest crap, and made a few more rude remarks it was over. Throughout it he also pretended the condom fell off and kept going though I told him there was another and seemed to mumble something about being pregnant already idk. Hopefully my dud ovary and blocked tube does its job. He also slapped my body several times throughout. He was all pleased with himself and I just kinda obvious fake laughed it off awkwardly kinda but thinking back I was in a scared disgusted daze at the same time. And then he just left trying to be charming and give me a hug and mumbled something about next time and I got kinda mad finally and said ""next time? il be hurting you"" he laughed and I pushed him out the door. I also said ""Your Welcome"" as I shut it just as a throwback. So my self confidence apparently only kickes in when I don't have a giant sergeant holding me down of course ugh.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like a damn fool for even thinking of trusting anyone to touch me. And I feel like an even bigger fool for being so nice as to not be able to stick up for myself when I wanted to escape. I have a hard time believing he thought 100% I was actually enjoying myself by the way he would look and treat me. But he is such a strong tall military guy and I'm short fat and weak so I could not actually stop him from doing these things. But if I said no go away he probably would have if not sulking like when we were young. But than if he could act this differently than before maybe not? I knew he would be a douche but I felt kinda helpess and hurt though I could have stoped it idk. Should have. I was like a man handled ragdoll. And he knew for a fact I was not into bdsm type stuff cuz right before we were talking about movies scrolling by on netflix and he mentioned the 50 Shades movie and I said it was dumb and would never do that stuff..

But its not like he assaulted me though cuz I consented. I didn't consent to the bad stuff but I couldn't say no either though and I tried and did start kicking and making like ""stop noises"". Which he ignored and made it worse.

&amp;#x200B;

Lost story short my throat and neck hurt and I feel like a disgusting piece if slutty meat now when yesterday I felt like a happy content nun watching my cartoons with my cat.   


I feel violated and hurt. But I smiled and let him continue so it could be over faster. Plus I didn't wana make him mad or sonething. Not that I was afraid he'd hit me just I hate disappointing people. But maybe I should have been afraid and I am really disapointed in myself.

&amp;#x200B;

Today my neck feels tight kind of. I thought my anxiety was just making it feel that way. And sore throat is a given. But I just did a short workout and I can feel the blood pulse and rush through my neck and its really unerving and I hate it and now my neck feels like its still being strangled a little but I have no bruise. Can breathe fine despite soreness in my throat. But the internet said people can drop dead days after even a little bit of that. Im scared. Id rather die than humiliate myself with going to the doctor and explaining it and since I cant drive Id have to explain to my master at belittling me sister to get there. But has anyone else felt this? Will it get better? Its just still fresh and maybe a little bruised inside? Google is giving me visions of my blood vessels snapping, strokes or esophagus being partially crushed without realizing it. Though   
I'm eating fine Id rather not randomly die in a few days. The sensation is just bothering me mentally bad.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice?

&amp;#x200B;

For the record Im just going to stick to dream men for the rest of my life. Im not someone who trusts easily and now I realize its not worth even involving myself with anyone. Even more so when Im broken sexually and cant feel stuff anyway. I literally just did it as an experiment and to make him happy so I could get some hugs from a human being. I feel so gross now like my body and mouth are contaminated and I should not touch anything, eat food, or kiss even my cats or family now like I will spread the nastiness of what I did to things I love.

I feel stupid for posting this,"I'm a 34 year old guy who lost his job to covid, living with parents who are emotionally and mentally abusing me. The threat of physical violence is certainly a spectre, but fortunately they have only hit me once since I was a teenager.

Like the title suggests, I know that I'm in a position of privilege compared to many others out there, but this really sucks.

I spend 20 hours in 'my room' per day because they are so miserable to be around. If I go to the kitchen to eat I get harassed for example. That is the absolute lightest of examples. Sometimes they fight and hit each other. When they fight they use any excuse to hide what they did, or they tell me that it was my fault.

I pretty much have no social interactions besides going to the grocery store.

I don't have the financial means to move out. I've got a spazzy dog, and I'm in a mid sized Northwest city where housing costs are absolutely ridiculous even without pet deposits. I've considered giving the dog away, but that is a heartbreaking thought when you have nothing and no friends.

Vent but advice/knowledge is appreciated. My best friend is suffering DV with her partner.,"My main questions are at the bottom if you just wanna skim. 
I'll try not to make this longer than it needs to be. 
My best friend (20 f) is in an abusive relationship &amp; its getting worse, they've been together for three years &amp; it's all abuse expect for sexual (that I'm aware of). She already has a lot going on with uni &amp; trying to improve her mental health, I don't want her to stay in this relationship while it just gets worse &amp; worse &amp; by the time she leaves.. If she does... She has even more, harder, stuff to work on.
The problem is, I'm a teenager &amp; I also live in a different state to her. She's come to stay with me before when things were bad but that was only for a week so she could have a “break“.
As you can tell, I'm a bit helpless.
I've offered to her for her to come live with me &amp; my family permanently as my family has been thru domestic violence &amp; we have given people a place to stay many times. My offer wasn't long ago &amp; I told her i/we could help her move up her around January time so she could have time to change unis &amp; settle in, that stuff. She just seems really reluctant to really take on help or even help herself as harsh as that sounds because she is so used to living in a DV situation (she moved in with her bfs family almost two years ago to get away from her families abuse) &amp; she also has bpd which makes leaving very hard to put it simple, if you have bpd is you get what I mean. Plus she has no friends or family there that she can go with. She only has me &amp; some of my friends up here.

I've spoken to my mum about it &amp; she told me I need to be straightforward with my friend which I have been because as we all know this is so serious &amp; dangerous &amp; friends have to be honest with eachother regardless. She told me I need to tell my friend to search for resources &amp; shelerts &amp; for her not to tell anyone (of course) &amp; reassure her that people will help her because of the situation she's in. I've told her this all. I've even given her resources to look into but she just won't take it. She's scared too &amp; I asked her how isn't she more scared to stay in this situation? He's only bringing her down &amp; he will only get worse. He's a manipulater &amp; he's gaslighting you. I said stuff like that in a caring way.she comes to me for support mostly &amp; I know that I can't “save“ her, she needs to save herself but it's honestly scary &amp; I don't want her to end up dead which is worst case situation. 

What can I do to help my friend?

How can I help my friend?,"I have a friend who has been suffering abuse at the hands of her addict husband. She is scared to leave as he has told her if she attempts to he will kill the entire family (she has four kids). He has been tormenting the kids as well, physically and mentally. 

Recently she has started posting about things that have been happening as well as a couple of pictures of damage that he has done. 

I want to call the cops but I’m nervous if I call when he is sober they won’t do anything and he will retaliate. 

I’m currently on the other side of the country so I don’t know when he is sober and when he is drunk. Will the cops still do something if he is sober?",domesticviolence
"I caught my biggest worry on tape, can anybody actually help? (UK based)","I'm a 23 year old homeowner (female). I'm selling my house, the house I was abused in for over a year. I'm currently detaching from my partner and working on healing but occasionally he comes back (he moved back with his dad just 5 miles away), lets himself in, etc. I let it happen and try avoid conflict because I know that until the house is sold, because we're so close geographically, I'm not safe.

This man has no care for the law, does what he wants, thinks he's above the law and isn't bothered about facing the police, punishment, or even jail time. If I fully broke things off with him now he would definitely, 100%, destroy the house and make it unsellable (at least to the current buyer who has a mortgage) - or at the very least keep me here much longer and closer to him! He wants to control my life.

So I will sell, and run. I have a buyer so within a couple of months I should be outta here, woooo! That said, I'm a young entrepreneur and own my home outright. He did some renovation work when we moved in, maybe £2-4k worth. We were in a happy relationship at this time and never discussed payment. Legally, he's entitled to nothing.

That said, he expects 50% (around £50,000). I have a voice recording of him saying:

&gt;'whatever you get from here, half of that is going in my account, which is payment for building this fucking shithole, that's taken up 3 years of my life with you, you miserable fucking piece of shit. if you don't, I will dedicate the rest of my fucking life to killing you, you fucking asshole'.

I will be moving back to nearer my hometown, about 40 miles away, but it's just a short train ride away. How can I get help and protect myself? I only have unclear images of physical abuse (I think because I'm so pale the camera doesn't pick up well, and he's never left bruises or serious marks/cuts), the only thing I have as hard 'evidence' is the recording - so even if I tried to press charges the highest charge he'd get is common assault? Even then, for a common assault offence to have taken place, the threat must be immediate, so the charge would fail.

What am I supposed to do to ensure my safety? The police in the UK are awful at protecting people, and so many domestic abuse victims die \*after\* the relationship ended. What can be done?",domesticviolence

Domestic Violence Awareness (needing advice),"I've heard so many stories and seen news about the rise of domestic violence incidents in the community especially during COVID. I know that not many people are aware, or know how to reach out/may be scared so I was wondering if anyone could give me advice on how you would feel about sharing survivor/victim stories online from those who are comfortable with it.

If we had a page for my community to increase awareness and ask for people familiar with domestic violence to submit stories (anonymously), would you? Would you feel comfortable if it was anonymous? What should we do to make it easier for you to submit your experiences publicly but anonymously?

Is this kind of sharing platform something that you would even support or is it detrimental in other ways? 

Would it be okay to ask for submissions online? Would you like it if there were facts/statistics about the problem on the page and possible resources to reach out to?

Thank you so much.",domesticviolence
A Short Film About Real Issues in the World,"Hello everybody. My name is Cole, I am a filmmaker and writer. I am currently working on a new short film concept and I need some help for my character development. This concept of this short film is as follows.

 *""When a worldwide outbreak hits a small town, the whole town goes into lockdown allowing no one to leave their homes. Five friends are restricted to just video calls to keep their very tight friendship strong. Only thing is, each friend has a different issue at home from domestic abuse, drug addiction and suicidal depression. The fight of keeping each other safe while not being able to be in contact with each other shows the struggles this lockdown has put upon their friendships and personal lives.""*

I am looking for anyone who is willing to come forward with their stories to help me write my characters correctly and well. I fully understand that these are very sensitive subjects and I will keep all posts or messages confidential if you want me too. I would really appreciate anyone who is comfortable and willing to come forward to me and help me out. The story for this project is a very real issue that has happened during these lockdowns and quarantine. Thank you again for anyone who is willing to help me.

My husband punched me in the back of the head today.,"We’ve never had a good relationship. Got married too quickly and found out I had no idea who he actually was because he lied to me about everything. It’s gotten mildly physical before - he’s grabbed my wrists hard while I was sitting in a chair holding our baby, he’s pushed me into a wall. He’s never punched me, until today. 

Today was the day I said enough is enough. Today is the day I became a single mother.  Today is the day I decided I will be getting a divorce and kicked my husband out of the house. 
Today is the day my entire life changes. My 2 year old who has never ever been away from me will have to be put in daycare, I will have to get a full-time job, and i will be doing everything on my own. I’ve never felt so free. I haven’t been able to breathe in forever and I finally can breathe again tonight.

Leaving for the Seventh Time,"A defining moment in my recovery from abuse was reading “The Gifts of Imperfection” by Brené Brown. If you are not familiar with Brené Brown, she is a research professor at the University of Houston and has spent the past two decades studying courage, vulnerability, shame, and empathy. I use her research and books in my recovery a lot, so get used to hearing about her. 

Any who, my defining moment while reading “The Gifts of Imperfection” was her discussion on the word courage and how it interacts with shame. She said: 

“The word courage comes from the latin word *cor* which means “to speak one's mind, by telling all one's heart…\[s\]hame hates it when we reach out and tell our story. It hates having words wrapped around it - it can’t survive being shared. Shame loves secrecy. When we bury our story, the shame metastasizes.” Brené Brown, The Gifts of Imperfection 

I had sooooooo much shame about my abusive marriage. I felt like I should have known better. I felt like I did know better. I felt like I did it to myself. I was afraid to tell people I was divorced for fear of the question “why?” I felt like I deserved him and the abuse if I was stupid enough to fall for his lies and charm and not leave sooner. Then, reading this part of the book, I snapped out of it. Everything my family and friends had been begging me to see. Begging me to lay down the mantle of continuing the verbal abuse on myself. I changed my narrative, and my mantra become:

“My story is one of love, trauma and abuse. The last 10 years of my life are painted with it. I am going to be honest about my story. I am going to tell my story. I refuse to feel shame for my story. I refuse to hold shame for something someone else CHOSE to do to me.” 

With this, I stopped holding back my truth, my story. If someone asked me why I was divorced, I told them, just as comfortably as if they asked me where I grew up. Shame still crept in from time to time, but in those moments I just repeated to myself, “I REFUSE TO HOLD SHAME FOR SOMETHING SOMEONE ELSE **CHOSE** TO DO TO ME!” 

So, here I have written a new chapter of my story. One I am not too proud of but is important to share, especially with other victims/survivors.

But first, some facts:

According to[ The National Domestic Violence Hotline](https://www.thehotline.org/resources/statistics/) and[ STAND! For Families Free of Violence](https://www.standffov.org/why-dont-they-leave):

* On average a victim attempts to leave 7 times before finally leaving for good.
* The most lethal time in an abusive relationship is after a victim leaves. More than 70% of domestic violence murders happen after the victim has gotten out. 
* Abusers often threaten suicide when a victim leaves. 
* Abusers often threaten to follow or harm victims or family members if they leave. 
* When a person lives in unending terror/stress, their ability to resist gets worn away. They become confused, exhausted, and lack the energy to make changes. 

Even though I consider my “Freedom Date” to be May 20th, 2015, I didn’t finally leave my ex-husband until June 15, 2015. May 20th signifies the day my mind and awareness of what was happening shifted. That was the day my willingness to do ANYTHING to not live a life in abuse was born. However, that being said, after I left on May 20, 2015, I went back a week later filled with promises of sobriety, therapy and change. Leaving did what I wanted it to do. It appeared to scare the shit out of him and showed him that I wasn’t afraid to go if he didn’t make changes. We had a great few weeks together. We talked a lot. He understood my apprehension and worked to re-build my trust. We went for drives around the mountains, and hikes we had never done. We gardened and worked on our house. We both knew, it seemed, that this was our last chance to recover and save our marriage. 

After three weeks of being recluse we had a weekend of plans scheduled with my family. Dinner and an outdoor concert with my folks, a birthday party for a good family friend, and an early Father's Day celebration for my Dad and Brother. 

The dinner with my parents was a little rough. He claimed I hadn’t told him about the weekend plans with my family, when in fact we had had significant conversations about every detail. He was mad, quiet, and difficult. The evening ended and we went home. The minute we walked into the house, he changed. I sat on the couch with our dog and he walked into the bedroom, glared at me, and then slammed the door. I wasn’t having it. I didn’t get why he was so upset, but it was his shit to deal with, not mine. So I stayed in the living room for a few hours until I knew he was asleep. When I thought it was safe, I went to bed, slithered my way onto my side and laid there, as quiet as I could be. Just when I was about to doze off, he got up, turned on the lights and told me how worthless I was. The fighting began. Four hours of verbal abuse. He told me I was ugly, horrible in bed, and had no purpose for him except to have his kids. He said he never actually loved me, he just wanted me to give him children. These are the statements I remember from that night, but there were a lot more. At one point he left, said he was going to the liquor store. When he left I looked at everything in my closet and started to wonder how quickly I could pack. I sat on the bed, laid with my dog, knowing if I chose to leave for good I would have to leave him too. I sobbed. I had no idea what was going to happen but I knew our little family was breaking up and I had to let go of my house, my dog, any possession I couldn’t fit into my car, and the life I had in the town I loved. I looked at myself in the mirror and saw that I wasn’t “living” my life, I was surviving it. Then I heard the screen door slam. He was home. It was too late to leave. The verbal abuse continued until he finally went to sleep. 

That night showed me that he wasn’t abusive because he was an alcoholic. He was abusive because he was abusive. Abuse is not a symptom of alcoholism. Abuse is a choice. I had no idea what to do, but I knew not to do anything drastic, for fear of my safety. So I decided to make it through the weekend with family and then leave on Monday. After work, I would not come home. 

We made it through Saturday. I told him all of the mean things he said the night before. This time he could not say he didn’t remember. I told him how indescribably hurt I was and that I didn’t know what to do. We went to the birthday party that night and made it through without being discovered. 

The next morning, on Sunday, he didn’t understand why I was being cold towards him. He wanted me to get over it already. He thought I was being dramatic. He thought the fact that I was holding onto what he said, and not forgiving him, was what was making our marriage difficult. Not his actions, his words, his behavior for the last 5 years. I lost it. I told him he wasn’t welcome to my parents house and to drop me off. 

When I arrived, I told my family we weren’t doing well and I wasn’t sure if we were going to make it. At one point that day he barged in and my family had to kick him out. I told my Mom that I wanted him to hurt like he made me hurt. Obviously this got her attention. We agreed I would get some things and come stay with them for a while until I figured out what was next. Marriage counseling? Divorce? I was in shock with grief and frozen from trauma. You know fight, flight or freeze… I was exhausted and I was frozen. My Mom took me home so I could pack my car and leave, again. He wasn’t home and neither was our dog, which meant he was out drinking somewhere. I quickly threw my clothes and special belongings in my car. With the engine turned on I was about to leave, but couldn’t. I called his Mom and talked to her instead. She understood where I was coming from, but being divorced herself, reminded me of the finality of the action I was about to take. I went back inside and turned on the TV. I decided I was going to wait for him so we could talk, again. An hour passed by and my Mom texted me to see how I was doing. I told her I was packed but waiting to talk to him. My Mom has never been one to tell me what to do, even as a child, she guided me but never “ordered” me. She texted me back and said, “get in your car and come home.” I was surprised by how direct she was, and trusting her, I left.

I didn’t sleep that night. In the past when I tried to leave he did a number of things to retaliate. Harassed me, became violent at the place or with the people who were helping me, threatened to commit suicide. I was at my family's house, with my parents, brother, pregnant sister-in-law and my 4 year old nephew. I was terrified of bringing them into the violence I had lived. So, I laid in my bed, with the windows open so I could hear his truck, and I waited. He drove by a few times, but didn’t do anything.  

The next morning he called me first thing and told me to come home. When I told him I wasn’t going to, he said he was on his way to the courthouse to file for divorce. I kept quiet and asked him to give me time. He kept saying it, and reminding me how worthless I was without him. Classic manipulation in hopes of making me beg him not to leave me. I did not fall for it. Over the next few weeks we went to two counseling sessions, but the more time I spent away from him, the more I noticed how terrified of him I was. 

At the beginning of July I learned he had been lying to me about drinking. That, FINALLY, was enough. I finally got it that he didn’t get it. I filed for divorce and told my family and friends about the abuse. I let go. All of the pieces I had been trying to hold together. All the lies I was trying to hide. All of the bruises and scars I had been hiding. I let go of it all at once. 

I often hear from other victims/survivors I am working with how ashamed they are for having a hard time leaving, staying away, and recovering from abuse. After emotional, verbal and psychological abuse, it’s easy to get down on ourselves for not being “better” at escaping. The negative self talk about anything and everything is a symptom of the abuse, and quite often is torturous enough to make us return. We are also exhausted from years of surviving. It’s hard to know whats up from down. I attempted to leave seven times before I succeeded. It’s hard, but it’s possible. What I am hoping can be taken from this post is: 

Leaving abuse is not easy, its fucking hard, but it is possible. 

There is no perfect way to do it.

Leaving abuse is messy. 

If leaving takes multiple attempts, it is not a reflection of your ability, resilience, or strength. It is a normal part of the process. 

It takes time and help, but eventually, the pain, grief and trauma will dissipate. I promise. There is life after domestic violence. 

Per usual, I have to say, if you are ready to leave an abusive relationship I STRONGLY encourage you to talk to a trained advocate at a[ local shelter](https://www.domesticshelters.org/help#?page=1) or the[ National Domestic Violence Hotline](https://www.thehotline.org/). A trained advocate is able to help you navigate your personal experiences, resources and obstacles and help you develop the best and safest plan of action.",domesticviolence
Afraid,"I feel so lost right now. My husband physically assaulted me again on Monday. I took my children and left and stayed with his sister. He of course is turning everything around on me and blaming it getting physical on me. I know it’s not my fault but his manipulation gets to me and I start feeling like I am to blame. I told him I want a divorce and he keeps telling me that we’ve made progress and I start believing it and feeling bad for him and the kids for wanting out, but how have we made progress if my arms are all bruised and me and my children are at a hotel while he is comfortable in the home that I pay for. I know the right thing to do but I haven’t done it. What is wrong with me? I’m a strong woman with an amazing career who supports my whole family. He doesn’t really work. I know he isn’t good for me but we have been together for 20 years and I have no family in the city and feel alone and isolated. I’m sorry for the ramble but I’m so confused and afraid and anxious and have no one to talk to expect his sister and mom who are understanding and supportive but in the end he is their family and they love him. If I tell my parents it will just spin all out of control. We separated in 2018 and my parents were supportive but if they know that he touched me again it will be so hard on them and my dad is sick with cancer and I don’t want to add that stress to them.

Advice on what to do after being abused,"Hi all,

I stayed silent about a lot of the abuse from the past, but am finally seeking advice on how to really recover and live my life.

While I was with my ex partner I had my medication thrown away and ended up hospitalized as a result. She refused to look into anything and during that time I was essentially told I had to keep a promise of going cold turkey (...from benzodiazepines, that can actually kill you from going cold turkey).

During that time she also physically abused me, I was punched a fair few times. I was made to feel like I had always done something wrong. She has also punched me in public.

She destroyed old gifts we had, stuff like that. One time prior to all of this she tried pulling my clothes off me in public.

My health declined from being withdrawn from medication, and I become more withdrawn and couldn't leave my house much. One night she admitted that she had 'accidently' slept with my friend , because it seemed like I no longer cared and that she did it to punish me.

For some dumb reason I still thought we could salvage things, and we stayed together for another 3 months.

After which we split up. I asked her to go her own way.

She refused to go her own way and refused to find her own friends.

I still feel like I can't visit certain places or speak to certain friends. It's been almost 2 years now but we're unable to even have a civil conversation. 

What should I do? Any advice on recovering? Is it too late for me to consider an injunction or something like that, to make sure she can't abuse me if I visit old friends or old places?",domesticviolence

I'm a woman, and I cannot defend myself, if my dad wasn't there who knows what he would have done. His threats about beating me were always disturbing to me, but for some reason I thought he wouldn't actually do it. I'm so disgusted with him and don't ever want to talk to him again.

"My mum's husband tried to kill me, and I don't know what to do.","I'm F16 (soon to be 17 in a month) from England and my mum has been married to a man since 2017/2018, who has been abusive emotionally and physically. I live separately from them in my grandma's house with her friend (he take care of her). I'm writing this at 2am while crying, so it might lack detail/not correct wording - ask questions if you need.

After they got married, they had a baby daughter. Before she was born, I remember my mum coming home early in the morning after being out all night. I was staying up for her, and when she came home she was crying. It got a lot of asking, but she told me that he punched her in the stomach (she was 2 months into the pregnancy).

After that incident, something else happened. I'm not sure clearly about what did, but she had accidently cut him after he tried to grab a knife from her in the kitchen (he was drunk) which resulted in him having a big cut on his finger. He called the police, and before they came, he began throwing death threats at me (I was in the living room and he was at the door of it yelling at mr). He told me that if I didn't get out of the house when he returned (from the hospital), that he would kill me and my whole family. This might have happened after the police came, but I'm not sure. He also yelled at me, calling me things like bitch, slut, etc. My grandma came to pick me up. He never apologised, but my mum forgave him.

Nothing really happened for the two years, apart from him continually yelling things at my mum like bitch, slut, saying she was useless, telling her not to do certain things, etc. I also remember him threatening to kick my mum out of the house, when they lived in their old house. He would always hit me, jab me with his hand in a way, but play it off as a joke.

Something else happened last month though. Me, my mum, and my little sister (around 1 year and 3 months old) had went out and we came back to their new house. The house is one floor, it was a living room, bathroom, kitchen, and bedroom. When he came home, he began drinking. Me and my mum went to the bedroom, to put my little sister to sleep, while he was in the living room. My little sister was crying a lot, but we still tried to put her to sleep. She's quite stubborn, lol. I took her from my mum, and had her on my upper body, trying to make her sleep. He came into the bedroom, and tried to take her away from me. I said that it was okay and that I can get her to sleep, but he still tried to take her away from me. At first he was just trying to take her, but then he began to grab my hands really hard and sort of jab them (like he was trying to dig his nails into my hands, but with his fingers?) but I kept persistenting. He became more violent in doing it, until he took his hand and put it around my neck, really hard, and began squeezing it until I could barely breathe and felt my vision going away a bit. I called the police. While I was on the phone with them, I was in the kitchen and he was in the living room (they're opposite from the house), he kept yelling at me saying he was going to kill me by cutting/stabbing me, he kept calling me things like bitch, slut, he kept saying that he didnt want a disabled person in the house (I'm blind in one eye), he kept saying to me to leave and that this would be the last time I would be in the house. When the police came after 10 minutes, I explained what happen and told them about the incident of where he threatened me. They asked questions on his previous behaviour, and I told them. They said that the only thing they could do is take me home.

After the incident, I kept having suicidal thoughts. I also had thoughts that he was going to come to me and kill me, like he would find me in the street and bash my head against the pavement, or how he was going to come to my house and kill me. As it's my birthday in a month, my mum told me she was going to come to my house with him and my sister to give me cake. I told her I didnt want him to come, and she asked me why. I told her how he made me feel, about the thoughts I had. She told me to think about how hard it was for her to bring the cake while with my little sister. I told her I also self harm because of it, and she told me I did it before what he did (this is true, but I also did it after/as result of what he did). She doesnt try to help me, and she keeps on defending him by saying he was angry, or how he has problems with his job, etc (this is also the same for when he threaten me the first time). She told me she would help me, and that she loved me more than him. My grandma bashes me for it, after what happen I didnt leave me room for a week/eat and she keeps saying about how it affected her. Because my mum bring my sister for us to take care of her when she work, he has to come and pick her up after 4PM. I leave to go upstairs so I dont have to see him, and my grandma said ""you're leaving like someone will hurt you"" (I'm not sure how to translate it).

My mum says she cant leave him because she doesn't want to live in my grandmas house ""under control"", and how she wont have money if she leaves (she has job, but I dont think it give much money)

No one is on my side. My family won't help me. Please help me, I dont want to die.",domesticviolence
Suggestions for serving divorce papers.,"
I met with a lawyer. I’m still in the planning stages of filing for divorce. I hope a position opens up near my parents several hours away so I can transfer near them with my employer. But with COVID and ability to work from home, I may not need to do that even.

I don’t want to have my husband served while at work.  The lawyer said I can just tell him that I’m filing and my lawyer just needs to know where to serve him and then suggest he obtain a lawyer and the lawyer can serve him divorce papers through his lawyer. 

We have child so it will need to go through mediation and requires 90 day waiting period so I don’t want to wait too much  longer. It would be easier if the children were back in school to have this conversation with him. But with COVID, I’m also scared to have this conversation with him while home alone.  So at this rate, I probably won’t file until end of August.

(Husband hurt me and threatened me for the first time a couple of months ago after 15 + years of marriage /together)

Family member abusing pregnant girlfriend,"Hello. As the title says, I have a family member that is physically, emotionally, and verbally abusive towards his 8.5 month pregnant girlfriend. The rest of the family is feeling pretty hopeless as ""she is the one that instigates it"" and ""they really should just break up"" and ""it's not our place to intervene"". 

He is an addict and abuses steroids, and his mood swings are explosive and dangerous. He strangles her at family dinners, hits, screams at, and threatens her, and has pushed her out of moving vehicles more than once (all while pregnant). 

It is not hyperbolic to expect that he will one day kill her and/or their child without intervention. Is there a way for me to anonymously report him?

That time of the year again,"Would you believe me if I say I document it? In a little green book hidden amongst hundreds of others. I try to correlate dates to see if the events have significance, I'm yet to find anything. It is random but it happens at least once a year.

Hair scraped back into a low bun, fingers bitten painfully short - collectively these numb the senses to what is felt elsewhere. Loose clothing and cold cream soothe the bruising, blood can be wiped away traceless but the throbbing never dulls away; these are my life lessons.

Sometimes I think I am lucky, God gifted me with poor sight. Once the glasses get knocked off it's all a blur ... literally.

The difficulty lies in dealing with the aftermath, helplessly running fingers across the wooden floor; porcelain, crystal glass and dirt those are my finds that day. Then something cold comes into touch, round and wired it sits lifeless, waiting for me patiently. I pull myself forward and place the cool wiring against my burning cheeks - the world comes into focus.

It all happens behind closed doors, hushed away and stifled.
Did I mention the raging episodes are mainly once a year? 
So I shouldn't exaggerate or worry, others have it worse - is how I incessantly console myself.

The next morning rolls in, my eyes wide open before the sun has a chance to shine its rays. I put on my scrubs and clammer around to grab my bag as I fumble with the door lock; my hospital ID softly swings around the nape of my neck. 

The bright lights in the ED stun the remaining sleep I have as I deal with the influx of patients destined to meet me that day. They come with hope, stories of their own and issues bigger than mine. 
So I don my mask, the happy one, and lift my heavy head high.

8 years of abusive marriage,"
This is my life story.

I am 30 year old female living in india. I got married At 22. It was an arrange marriage. After marriage I started noticing that my husband gets angry very quickly for small things like why snacks are not ready when he reaches home from office. Why there there is less salt in food. As I got married straight out the college I dint know cooking at all. I was learning to cook after marriage. But I adjusted to all that and learned to cook soon. Bit he still would complain that I don't cook like his mom. I should learn from his mother.  When he gets angry and shouts at me his language becomes very bad and will abuse me verbally. 

I had told all this to my mother, she told me its OK its alright, just don't make him angry. Behave nicely with him do everything for him. Keep him happy. 

After 1 year of marriage his mother started asking for kids. Before getting married he had suggested that we will wait for 3 years after marriage I had also agreed to it as I dint wanted to have kids immediately.
But when his mother started asking him, he started to force me for it. As I was taking contraceptive pills. He forced me to stop taking those. But I asked him to give me some time, give me 3 months I will get my health in good condition as i was anemic, so that in 3 months i can improve my haemoglobin level and then try for pregnancy. He dint agree for it and forced me to have sex without my consent. I was crying all the time and he started to shout at me saying what are u crying for, you are crying as if I raped you. 

After a month I got pregnant. But that pregnancy resulted in miscarriage.
Once the miscarriage happened his mother blamed me stating that as I was taking contraceptive pills, I got miscarriage and I am not fit to bear children. He also agreed to it and that resulted in big fight. My parents also got involved, his parents also got involved. The fight was big. He had clearly told that you cannot come back until your parents apologize to my parents, as your parents have spoken a lot about me.
I tried to make him understand as we have married we should try to work on the relationship if parents are having a fight let them have there fights should not affect our relationship.
In spite of him saying don't come. I went to stay with him, after I went thats when the physical abuse started. The first time he hit me I told my mom about it she said is ok it happened only once, it won't happen again. Then I got pregnant.  But the verbal abuse was still present. Once my daughter was born. Physically hitting me, shouting at me, forcing me to have sex. Even if I say no he would force me to do it. While I am sleeping he would come and remove my pants and do sex with me. When I question him for such kind of behavior he says he does it for relaxation purpose. All this continued. When my daughter was 5 years he hit me a lot. Thats when I took my daughter and went to parents place. Told my parents that i am not going back to that house and i want a divorce. But my parents never believed me they say that I should adjust and live there. They thought I was depressed and they took me for counselling so that I do not talk about divorce and go back there. My parents also physically hit me, and they sent my daughter to husband's house. When I question my parents they say that I do not deserve to a mother. They say that in every marriage there is violence you should learn to adjust for your daughter. My parents took away my money and then they forced me to go back to that house. I told them clearly that I will not live in that house I will go away some where else. But they said we don't care what you do but you should go back to that house.
they sent me back. I lived at my husband house for 1 month then I left the house. Sent an email to police and to husband stating that I am leaving the house. I took up a job in another city and I am living in a hostel now.

Now I am preparing for divorce and custody of my daughter.
 But at times I feel guilty that I left my daughter in that house.

So lonely,"I feel so alone and depressed. I can’t talk to anyone my church...I’m too embarrassed. I can’t talk to a therapist because I have children and they have to report abuse if there are children present in the home. He has never hurt our children.

I read stories on here about abusers and I feel like no one is in the same situation as me. Sometimes we go years without an incident. I can’t tear my children’s lives apart for my safety. They are so happy and have no idea. 

I’m starting to feel like a shell of a person. Like an extension of him. I agree with his every opinion to keep the peace. 

I feel like I will never be happy. That maybe I can leave when the kids are grown.",domesticviolence

My black neighbor is beating his white girlfriend and I don't know what to do given the current political climate.,"My neighbor moved in two weeks before the lockdown happened.  This is an almost an exclusively white neighborhood.  When we met he spoke about how there were racists in his last apartment complex and I assured him that my girlfriend and I and the other tenant were not racist.

About two weeks after he moved in, we heard him and girlfriend yelling at each other.  Sometimes it was during the day, sometimes it would be in the middle of the night.  We never said anything because we didn't know how to address it.  We told the landlord a few times about it and we don't know how he addressed it but he said he did.

Eventually we could hear things getting physical.  It sounded like there was a knock down drag out fight happening next door.  We called the cops.  When the cops came the couple had left the apartment to go for a walk and the cops couldn't really do anything.  As a white person, I was very hesitant to call the cops on a black man.  As far as I know he doesn't know we have called the cops.

There has been little noise coming from their apartment but we hear some things now and again.  When the girlfriend isn't wearing long sleeve shirts you can see the bruises on her arms.

Today I heard his girlfriend yell, ""stop, you're hurting me!""  We called the landlord and our landlord called him.  We could hear our neighbor yelling at the landlord that he was afraid for his life and that she is having medicine issues and it makes her scream.  He feels like everyone hates him and that we're playing around with his life.  Our landlord said he spoke with the girlfriend and she said she wasn't being abused.  Which I do not think that any victim would say they were being abused while the accused is in the same room.

We do not know how to resolve this issue.  We want to talk to them but they seem to not be admitting what's going on.  I could be wrong I suppose, maybe she's has an issue that makes her yell and scream in the middle of the night when no one is abusing her.   I don't want to call the cops on a black man where things could escalate and he could be killed.  I don't want to do nothing and let either one of them hurt the other one.  Its causing us real emotional distress having to listen to it.  It doesn't seem like it's a good idea to confront your neighbors about how one of them is being abused or how they might be abusing each other.

We don't know what to do.",domesticviolence

"Damned if I do, damned if I don't..","Warning long story. If this is the wrong community, please advice me for the right one so that I can move this post.

I have lived in an abusive relationship for about 5 years now and finally got rid of him in a few months ago. It went far (as usual with this guy) and he got a restraining order, after I called the cops on him ( I really had to, he was drunk and was chasing me in my own apt). 

But this was not the first time. It has happened 7 or 8 times before that he has gone violent on me to the point that I had to call the police. I know l, I've been stupid to take him back but trust me, ge is a master manipulator and said all the right things when he was ""sorry"". 

He used to get drunk or high and made me break up with him since he was a coward and couldn't do it. I hope you get the picture here. All of this has been very painful to me, bc I really loved him. I have now, since the last time he fucked up, decided to never take him back again and kept my promise. 

He hasn't contacted me, but i know that is only bc there is a restraining order on him. I'm sure he'll reach out one way or another and do as usual, beg me to come back for he has changed an so on. 

I now understand that he never loved me and only wanted to owe me and use my energy so I promised myself to not give him another second of my life.

Then came the call. Today, the day after my birthday and it was my lawyer, telling me that the cops want to speak to me one last time and then they have enough to prosecute him and it will go to court. The probability of him getting a jail sentence is high. 

Now comes the dilemma. I want to leave this behind. I'm happy I have the restraining order so he won't come near for another 4 months at least , but I am so so afraid. If I do proceed with this, it will take more of my time and energy that I really don't want to put in this bs anymore, cuz I'm so tired of this drama, but if I don't do it he probably won't leave me alone.

Wtf should I do. I study at uni and really want to focus on that. That's really all I want to do. I just want him to leave me alone.",domesticviolence
Local papa johns owner strikes wife in public bar!,,domesticviolence
I attacked my abuser and now he is claiming it's domestic violence - please help,"I'm hoping that someone can give me advice or just some moral support.  I have been with my bf for four and a half years, at least two and a half of those have been abusive.  Things really stepped up at the start of the year and with the lockdown the levels of emotional abuse, sexual coercion and the fear of angry moods and threats to sleep with other people have been unbearable.  Things reached a fever pitch a couple of weeks ago after I was coerced into a threesome I had categorically said I did not want to do, after being plied with alcohol and drugs.  I have been really struggling since then.

I asked him to leave last Monday after he told me he wanted to sleep with men.  And then I begged him to leave on Tuesday.  He keeps saying that we are a union and will work it out.  He pretended that everything was fine the next two days, telling me over and over how he couldn't wait to spend Friday night with me and to have sex.  Friday night comes around and he smokes a huge amount of weed and ignores me all night, texting and not replying when I talk to him.  It gets to nearly 11pm and I look over at him as he's still texting.  He gets very cross and accused me of giving him dirty looks and asks why.  I explained that I was really upset that he had ignored me all night and broken his work to me yet again, despite promising me that he wanted to fix that.  He made some excuse about it being the lockdown and how the world was different and then told me that I should be happy anyway as he was texting about setting up sleeping with a guy.  I lost it.  I shouted and cried, I told him how if spent hours getting ready, cleaning up, looking nice etc and he looked me up at down in disgust and laughed in my face.  He shoved me across the kitchen at some point and the. Said something I really can't remember and I flew at him, kicked his legs and told him I would like to slit his throat.  It was wrong, I should have kept my temper but I needed him to see just how much pain he has caused me.

Of course he flees the house, runs to his friends, tells them all I'm an alcoholic and he's suffering from domestic violence.  He's had me referred to mental health professionals and I've ended up being passed on for an alcohol dependency intervention.  I've explained to every professional what is happening and they are all very understanding but I'm just in turmoil.  I really don't know what to do.  I just want to believe that he hasn't done any of this on purpose.  I've just spoken to him again about the way he treats me and it doesn't matter what I say, or what I show he finds a way to say it's somehow my fault.  I feel really broken.  I'm in the UK if that helps anyone with any advice.

Domestic Violence Awareness (needing advice),"I've heard so many stories and seen news about the rise of domestic violence incidents in the community especially during COVID. I know that not many people are aware, or know how to reach out/may be scared so I was wondering if anyone could give me advice on how you would feel about sharing survivor/victim stories online from those who are comfortable with it.

If we had a page for my community to increase awareness and ask for people familiar with domestic violence to submit stories (anonymously), would you? Would you feel comfortable if it was anonymous? What should we do to make it easier for you to submit your experiences publicly but anonymously?

Is this kind of sharing platform something that you would even support or is it detrimental in other ways? 

Would it be okay to ask for submissions online? Would you like it if there were facts/statistics about the problem on the page and possible resources to reach out to?

Thank you so much.",domesticviolence
A Short Film About Real Issues in the World,"Hello everybody. My name is Cole, I am a filmmaker and writer. I am currently working on a new short film concept and I need some help for my character development. This concept of this short film is as follows.

 *""When a worldwide outbreak hits a small town, the whole town goes into lockdown allowing no one to leave their homes. Five friends are restricted to just video calls to keep their very tight friendship strong. Only thing is, each friend has a different issue at home from domestic abuse, drug addiction and suicidal depression. The fight of keeping each other safe while not being able to be in contact with each other shows the struggles this lockdown has put upon their friendships and personal lives.""*

I am looking for anyone who is willing to come forward with their stories to help me write my characters correctly and well. I fully understand that these are very sensitive subjects and I will keep all posts or messages confidential if you want me too. I would really appreciate anyone who is comfortable and willing to come forward to me and help me out. The story for this project is a very real issue that has happened during these lockdowns and quarantine. Thank you again for anyone who is willing to help me.

My husband punched me in the back of the head today.,"We’ve never had a good relationship. Got married too quickly and found out I had no idea who he actually was because he lied to me about everything. It’s gotten mildly physical before - he’s grabbed my wrists hard while I was sitting in a chair holding our baby, he’s pushed me into a wall. He’s never punched me, until today. 

Today was the day I said enough is enough. Today is the day I became a single mother.  Today is the day I decided I will be getting a divorce and kicked my husband out of the house. 
Today is the day my entire life changes. My 2 year old who has never ever been away from me will have to be put in daycare, I will have to get a full-time job, and i will be doing everything on my own. I’ve never felt so free. I haven’t been able to breathe in forever and I finally can breathe again tonight.

Leaving for the Seventh Time,"A defining moment in my recovery from abuse was reading “The Gifts of Imperfection” by Brené Brown. If you are not familiar with Brené Brown, she is a research professor at the University of Houston and has spent the past two decades studying courage, vulnerability, shame, and empathy. I use her research and books in my recovery a lot, so get used to hearing about her. 

Any who, my defining moment while reading “The Gifts of Imperfection” was her discussion on the word courage and how it interacts with shame. She said: 

“The word courage comes from the latin word *cor* which means “to speak one's mind, by telling all one's heart…\[s\]hame hates it when we reach out and tell our story. It hates having words wrapped around it - it can’t survive being shared. Shame loves secrecy. When we bury our story, the shame metastasizes.” Brené Brown, The Gifts of Imperfection 

I had sooooooo much shame about my abusive marriage. I felt like I should have known better. I felt like I did know better. I felt like I did it to myself. I was afraid to tell people I was divorced for fear of the question “why?” I felt like I deserved him and the abuse if I was stupid enough to fall for his lies and charm and not leave sooner. Then, reading this part of the book, I snapped out of it. Everything my family and friends had been begging me to see. Begging me to lay down the mantle of continuing the verbal abuse on myself. I changed my narrative, and my mantra become:

“My story is one of love, trauma and abuse. The last 10 years of my life are painted with it. I am going to be honest about my story. I am going to tell my story. I refuse to feel shame for my story. I refuse to hold shame for something someone else CHOSE to do to me.” 

With this, I stopped holding back my truth, my story. If someone asked me why I was divorced, I told them, just as comfortably as if they asked me where I grew up. Shame still crept in from time to time, but in those moments I just repeated to myself, “I REFUSE TO HOLD SHAME FOR SOMETHING SOMEONE ELSE **CHOSE** TO DO TO ME!” 

So, here I have written a new chapter of my story. One I am not too proud of but is important to share, especially with other victims/survivors.

But first, some facts:

According to[ The National Domestic Violence Hotline](https://www.thehotline.org/resources/statistics/) and[ STAND! For Families Free of Violence](https://www.standffov.org/why-dont-they-leave):

* On average a victim attempts to leave 7 times before finally leaving for good.
* The most lethal time in an abusive relationship is after a victim leaves. More than 70% of domestic violence murders happen after the victim has gotten out. 
* Abusers often threaten suicide when a victim leaves. 
* Abusers often threaten to follow or harm victims or family members if they leave. 
* When a person lives in unending terror/stress, their ability to resist gets worn away. They become confused, exhausted, and lack the energy to make changes. 

Even though I consider my “Freedom Date” to be May 20th, 2015, I didn’t finally leave my ex-husband until June 15, 2015. May 20th signifies the day my mind and awareness of what was happening shifted. That was the day my willingness to do ANYTHING to not live a life in abuse was born. However, that being said, after I left on May 20, 2015, I went back a week later filled with promises of sobriety, therapy and change. Leaving did what I wanted it to do. It appeared to scare the shit out of him and showed him that I wasn’t afraid to go if he didn’t make changes. We had a great few weeks together. We talked a lot. He understood my apprehension and worked to re-build my trust. We went for drives around the mountains, and hikes we had never done. We gardened and worked on our house. We both knew, it seemed, that this was our last chance to recover and save our marriage. 

After three weeks of being recluse we had a weekend of plans scheduled with my family. Dinner and an outdoor concert with my folks, a birthday party for a good family friend, and an early Father's Day celebration for my Dad and Brother. 

The dinner with my parents was a little rough. He claimed I hadn’t told him about the weekend plans with my family, when in fact we had had significant conversations about every detail. He was mad, quiet, and difficult. The evening ended and we went home. The minute we walked into the house, he changed. I sat on the couch with our dog and he walked into the bedroom, glared at me, and then slammed the door. I wasn’t having it. I didn’t get why he was so upset, but it was his shit to deal with, not mine. So I stayed in the living room for a few hours until I knew he was asleep. When I thought it was safe, I went to bed, slithered my way onto my side and laid there, as quiet as I could be. Just when I was about to doze off, he got up, turned on the lights and told me how worthless I was. The fighting began. Four hours of verbal abuse. He told me I was ugly, horrible in bed, and had no purpose for him except to have his kids. He said he never actually loved me, he just wanted me to give him children. These are the statements I remember from that night, but there were a lot more. At one point he left, said he was going to the liquor store. When he left I looked at everything in my closet and started to wonder how quickly I could pack. I sat on the bed, laid with my dog, knowing if I chose to leave for good I would have to leave him too. I sobbed. I had no idea what was going to happen but I knew our little family was breaking up and I had to let go of my house, my dog, any possession I couldn’t fit into my car, and the life I had in the town I loved. I looked at myself in the mirror and saw that I wasn’t “living” my life, I was surviving it. Then I heard the screen door slam. He was home. It was too late to leave. The verbal abuse continued until he finally went to sleep. 

That night showed me that he wasn’t abusive because he was an alcoholic. He was abusive because he was abusive. Abuse is not a symptom of alcoholism. Abuse is a choice. I had no idea what to do, but I knew not to do anything drastic, for fear of my safety. So I decided to make it through the weekend with family and then leave on Monday. After work, I would not come home. 

We made it through Saturday. I told him all of the mean things he said the night before. This time he could not say he didn’t remember. I told him how indescribably hurt I was and that I didn’t know what to do. We went to the birthday party that night and made it through without being discovered. 

The next morning, on Sunday, he didn’t understand why I was being cold towards him. He wanted me to get over it already. He thought I was being dramatic. He thought the fact that I was holding onto what he said, and not forgiving him, was what was making our marriage difficult. Not his actions, his words, his behavior for the last 5 years. I lost it. I told him he wasn’t welcome to my parents house and to drop me off. 

When I arrived, I told my family we weren’t doing well and I wasn’t sure if we were going to make it. At one point that day he barged in and my family had to kick him out. I told my Mom that I wanted him to hurt like he made me hurt. Obviously this got her attention. We agreed I would get some things and come stay with them for a while until I figured out what was next. Marriage counseling? Divorce? I was in shock with grief and frozen from trauma. You know fight, flight or freeze… I was exhausted and I was frozen. My Mom took me home so I could pack my car and leave, again. He wasn’t home and neither was our dog, which meant he was out drinking somewhere. I quickly threw my clothes and special belongings in my car. With the engine turned on I was about to leave, but couldn’t. I called his Mom and talked to her instead. She understood where I was coming from, but being divorced herself, reminded me of the finality of the action I was about to take. I went back inside and turned on the TV. I decided I was going to wait for him so we could talk, again. An hour passed by and my Mom texted me to see how I was doing. I told her I was packed but waiting to talk to him. My Mom has never been one to tell me what to do, even as a child, she guided me but never “ordered” me. She texted me back and said, “get in your car and come home.” I was surprised by how direct she was, and trusting her, I left.

I didn’t sleep that night. In the past when I tried to leave he did a number of things to retaliate. Harassed me, became violent at the place or with the people who were helping me, threatened to commit suicide. I was at my family's house, with my parents, brother, pregnant sister-in-law and my 4 year old nephew. I was terrified of bringing them into the violence I had lived. So, I laid in my bed, with the windows open so I could hear his truck, and I waited. He drove by a few times, but didn’t do anything.  

The next morning he called me first thing and told me to come home. When I told him I wasn’t going to, he said he was on his way to the courthouse to file for divorce. I kept quiet and asked him to give me time. He kept saying it, and reminding me how worthless I was without him. Classic manipulation in hopes of making me beg him not to leave me. I did not fall for it. Over the next few weeks we went to two counseling sessions, but the more time I spent away from him, the more I noticed how terrified of him I was. 

At the beginning of July I learned he had been lying to me about drinking. That, FINALLY, was enough. I finally got it that he didn’t get it. I filed for divorce and told my family and friends about the abuse. I let go. All of the pieces I had been trying to hold together. All the lies I was trying to hide. All of the bruises and scars I had been hiding. I let go of it all at once. 

I often hear from other victims/survivors I am working with how ashamed they are for having a hard time leaving, staying away, and recovering from abuse. After emotional, verbal and psychological abuse, it’s easy to get down on ourselves for not being “better” at escaping. The negative self talk about anything and everything is a symptom of the abuse, and quite often is torturous enough to make us return. We are also exhausted from years of surviving. It’s hard to know whats up from down. I attempted to leave seven times before I succeeded. It’s hard, but it’s possible. What I am hoping can be taken from this post is: 

Leaving abuse is not easy, its fucking hard, but it is possible. 

There is no perfect way to do it.

Leaving abuse is messy. 

If leaving takes multiple attempts, it is not a reflection of your ability, resilience, or strength. It is a normal part of the process. 

It takes time and help, but eventually, the pain, grief and trauma will dissipate. I promise. There is life after domestic violence.

Afraid,"I feel so lost right now. My husband physically assaulted me again on Monday. I took my children and left and stayed with his sister. He of course is turning everything around on me and blaming it getting physical on me. I know it’s not my fault but his manipulation gets to me and I start feeling like I am to blame. I told him I want a divorce and he keeps telling me that we’ve made progress and I start believing it and feeling bad for him and the kids for wanting out, but how have we made progress if my arms are all bruised and me and my children are at a hotel while he is comfortable in the home that I pay for. I know the right thing to do but I haven’t done it. What is wrong with me? I’m a strong woman with an amazing career who supports my whole family. He doesn’t really work. I know he isn’t good for me but we have been together for 20 years and I have no family in the city and feel alone and isolated. I’m sorry for the ramble but I’m so confused and afraid and anxious and have no one to talk to expect his sister and mom who are understanding and supportive but in the end he is their family and they love him. If I tell my parents it will just spin all out of control. We separated in 2018 and my parents were supportive but if they know that he touched me again it will be so hard on them and my dad is sick with cancer and I don’t want to add that stress to them. Ugh. sorry for the ramble. I’m so lost.",domesticviolence
Advice on what to do after being abused,"Hi all,

I stayed silent about a lot of the abuse from the past, but am finally seeking advice on how to really recover and live my life.

While I was with my ex partner I had my medication thrown away and ended up hospitalized as a result. She refused to look into anything and during that time I was essentially told I had to keep a promise of going cold turkey (...from benzodiazepines, that can actually kill you from going cold turkey).

During that time she also physically abused me, I was punched a fair few times. I was made to feel like I had always done something wrong. She has also punched me in public.

She destroyed old gifts we had, stuff like that. One time prior to all of this she tried pulling my clothes off me in public.

My health declined from being withdrawn from medication, and I become more withdrawn and couldn't leave my house much. One night she admitted that she had 'accidently' slept with my friend , because it seemed like I no longer cared and that she did it to punish me.

For some dumb reason I still thought we could salvage things, and we stayed together for another 3 months.

After which we split up. I asked her to go her own way.

She refused to go her own way and refused to find her own friends.

I still feel like I can't visit certain places or speak to certain friends. It's been almost 2 years now but we're unable to even have a civil conversation. 

What should I do? Any advice on recovering? Is it too late for me to consider an injunction or something like that, to make sure she can't abuse me if I visit old friends or old places?",domesticviolence

My (20F) stepdad (39M) threatened to kill my mother (36F) during an argument.,"A little long, TLDR at the bottom. This is my first time posting in this sub, the mods from r/relationships sent me to you guys. Please forgive any irregularities. 

I recently moved back in with my parents. They fight. A lot. Nasty, screaming-match fights that can last for days. They had a child last year which has naturally created new tensions in the house, mostly because my stepfather contributes substantially less to childcare than my mother. It's obvious he loves the baby, but he often leaves my mother to do 70–90% of the grunt work (e.g. napping while she's in tears from back pain and needs help with the baby, spending hours at the gym/not adjusting any part of his pre-baby schedule, etc.) They are both currently unemployed and basically in the house together 24/7. To be honest it's clear that he's not equally contributing and it's grinding her down, but they don't communicate well at all and the whole situation is generating a lot of resentment. He is currently doing CBT therapy for anger management, which was a stipulation of an ultimatum my mother apparently gave him to avoid divorce. Couples therapy is not currently an option for insurance reasons.

A few months ago he purchased a rifle for home defense. I believe it's an AR-15. It is not in a safe. It stays beside their bed in the case it was purchased in. The other week, they got into an argument that ended with my stepdad storming out of the house. My mom broke down in front of me and admitted that he recently said to her ""I should shoot you in the fucking head"" while they were having a fight. Guys, I don't have the words to describe what hearing that felt like. It was a sickening, primal fear. My face must have given me away because she instantly regretted telling me, and spent the next half hour reassuring me that she felt completely safe and knew for a fact that he would never harm her. But what mother wouldn't?

My stepdad has never struck me as the violent type. He's a bit more confrontational than my mother and I, but I've always attributed that to his hailing from a more urban, crowded part of the country than us. I have always felt completely and totally safe around him. He has been in my life since I was a teenager, and I've come to view him as my true father, which only makes this worse. I feel guilty for the fears that I'm having. He has done so much for me, and has supported me in so many ways, and here I am, scared that he might harm my mom or my sibling or all of us. I will say that he is ex-military (non-combat) and ex-NFL, and we have suspected for some time that he may suffer from CTE.

I am physically ill with paranoia. They have been screaming most of the day, and with every lull in the argument I'm terrified that I will hear gunshots. I know this is very macabre, and it might just be my anxiety rearing its ugly head, but my quality of life has dropped significantly since this began. I don't have a big biological family. My mother and sibling are all I have, and if something were to happen to them, my life would be over. I just don't know what to do. My mom is financially dependent on him, and she does not have a degree. If I were to do anything that would remove either of them from this house, she and the baby (and myself) would be homeless and without any money. And although I feel horribly selfish even thinking about my own situation, this is really taxing me emotionally. I'm trying to get through college while also working part-time, and now I have this nightmarish anxiety always waiting for me at home. On top of that, I'm often left to care for the baby in a separate room while they fight. I can't do it all. It's eating me up.

My longterm boyfriend (24M) who, admittedly, is much more level-headed and much less anxious than I am, is trying to reassure me that my stepdad wouldn't hurt my mother. He thinks it was purely a heat of the moment anger that spilled out, and perhaps a result of my stepdad's military/police training. And really, I have never once felt unsafe around my stepfather until this happened. But I'm trying to look at the facts here, which are:

* There is a gun in the house that is in plain sight at all times, not in a safe.
* They are having bitter, drawn out fights every other week or so, often within the same space as the weapon.
* They are constantly in close proximity with little reprieve from one another.
* He has impulsively threatened to shoot her.
* It is possible that he has suffered brain injuries that can impact decision-making.
* Also a fact is that the best predictor of future behavior is past behavior, and my stepdad has never laid a hand on my mother (that I know of.)

What do I do? What *can* I do? What *should* I do? Am I overreacting? Any advice will be appreciated so much. 

TLDR; My stepdad threatened to shoot my mother in the head during a recent argument. He owns a gun which he doesn't keep locked up. They are having intense arguments several times a month, primarily surrounding tensions caused by my new baby sibling. He has never hurt me or my mother, and is by all accounts a kind person, but the paranoia is wearing me down. Neither my mother nor myself are in a position to leave the house, and I don't even know if that's something that should be considered. I am juggling school, work, the fear of my mother being harmed, and the responsibility of caring for my sibling while they fight. I am overwhelmed, scared, and confused. I need some guidance.",domesticviolence
My boyfriend raped me. I want to understand why.,"CROSS POSTED, throw away account 

Last night my boyfriend and father of my child raped me. It was my birthday. My first night out, baby with a sitter, for the first time in over a year. I got intoxicated and a took one single hit of weed. I was unable to walk, I had slurred speech, confusion, and I think I periodically passed out. My boyfriend was pretty much sober, however. 
He brought me to bed and I was laying on my back. At first I thought I was dreaming when I realized he wasn’t listening to me saying “no “ repeatedly. I used my arms to try and push him away. I said I don’t want this, I don’t know who you are, and even cried “rape” over and over. Nothing stopped him. I couldn’t believe he could be capable of this. I remember crying “no, not YOU! Not you not you!” Because I never imagined he was capable of this... 
This morning I woke up and sat up in disbelief. I wanted to believe it was a nightmare. But he woke up to. He seemed irritated and asked if I remember last night. I said I had a bad dream. He said it was real, that I kept crying rape, saying no, that I don’t know him. So there’s no doubt in my mind that this all happened. But I’m shocked that he so readily confessed to it like he doesn’t see a problem ?! He admits I was blacked out, didn’t want sex, cried rape, but he chose to continue anyway. I feel numb, scared, and confused. Just, why? Why would he do this? I feel betrayed, violated, and lost.",domesticviolence
boyfriend slapped me for the first time and claims he doesn't remember,"Ok guys this might be a long post, but I'm in a bad situation. I need advice and your opinions/ and any personal experience you might have relating to my situation. I've {female 21 yr} been dating my boyfriend {male 20yrs} for about 2 years, its been up and down definitely toxic at times, but recently as we've both been going to therapy and getting help we have been better than ever. Some background on my boyfriend, his father is very abusive and has been his whole life, he still lives with his parents &amp; his environment at home is usually very toxic. Yesterday I was over at his parents house and we were watching a show in his room, his younger sister {shes 9 years old} came and watched it with us, my boyfriend fell asleep quickly so I let him be and am just enjoying the show with his little sister. As time passes its about 8pm, I decide to wake him up because I know that he won't be able to fall asleep later that night if he keeps napping. Hes probably been asleep for about an hour and a half maybe more, so I gently wake him &amp; hes pretty grumpy and annoyed. I explain to him that I just wanted him to be able to fall asleep later and that it was getting late. He's still half asleep and I let him be for a few mins- i lovingly put my head on his and nudge him a few times (I can see how that would be annoying but its out of love) he then gets very angry and raises his voice telling me to cut it out. I tell him I have to go soon and want to hangout with him before I go and I nudge him again. He rolls over facing me and backhands me in the face, it was hard. Sometimes we play rough but this was uncalled for and it really hurt. When he slapped me obviously his sister heard it and she put her hand on my face and said hes a meanie, but maybe she thought we were just playing around. A few seconds passed by and my boyfriend didn't do or say anything, I was furious like blood boiling angry and hurt. So I get up and go to the restroom worried I would cry in front of his sister. After I get my stuff I say I'm going home, I did not want to be there as it was only past 8pm my boyfriend and his sister are surprised because I usually stay later. I walk out and head to my car. My boyfriend has the audacity to ask why I'm leaving and I'm dumbfounded. I even say are you fucking kidding me you slapped me in the face &amp; you did it in front of your little sister? He says he doesn't REMEMBER slapping me and that it was on accident and points out that nothing like this has ever happened before. I keep my distance and don't say much after he gives his speech saying he's sorry and bs he tries to tell me to come inside. HELL no he asks for a hug and I say no thanks and I get in my car and leave. He has never hit me before, although his slap was hard it didn't cause damage to my face, but I feel so disrespected and that its a huuuuge red flag. He keeps saying he loves me, that he's sorry and that it was an accident. Am I stupid to believe him? Because part of me wants to and then my rational side kicks in and smells the bullshit. Should I leave him? I may have low self-worth but something like this I will not stand for or forgive. They say once your partner hits you most likely they will again and I'm afraid that if I don't leave that it will. Tell me your thoughts please, as this happened yesterday I am still coming to terms with everything. Is this considered abuse? What do I do?",domesticviolence
PTSD is haunting my new relationship and I fear I’m destroying it. Advice?,"Brief back-story: My (F29) now ex-husband was incredibly abusive. Physically, mentally, emotionally and financially. He’s currently facing 20 years because he tried to kill me. This was just under a year ago (we separated over a year ago) and, while I have come to terms with what happened, the emotional and physical scars still exist. I have been formally diagnosed with ptsd - the effects of which I am still learning to recognize and cope with. 

After I moved to a new city, found a job, my own place, got a dog and became settled I met and became friends with a man through work. After his relationship ended we started dating (it’s been almost 3 months). We were close when we were friends and are even closer now. 

He treats me well, he is kind to me and others, he helps the local community and is hard-working. Even so, I find myself sabotaging our relationship because of my past. I am easily triggered and I find ways to ‘hate’ him. I nit-pick his actions trying to somehow uncover his eventual abuse in some kind of “ta-da, gotcha” type way. 

People always say “trust your gut” but I don’t know what that looks like any more. I’m always second guessing myself to the point that it feels like I’m gaslighting....myself. I don’t trust him when I am triggered nor do I trust myself. I feel like I’m going crazy. 

I name-call (he does not) and yell (he does not). It’s like I have become the abuser because I am so used to having to constantly be on the defense. I don’t want to be this way, feel this way or treat him this way. I don’t want to be the reason our relationship fails. 

He is incredibly supportive and has said he will work to build my trust and to understand my triggers. I feel like such a burden and so pathetic - my need to feel strong and how I try to achieve that is my weakness. 

I need advice, stories, experiences. I’m so inside my head that I don’t even feel like myself.",domesticviolence

Bystander who called the cops- Did I do the right thing?,"The couple who lives directly above me often argue. There are typically lots of thuds. They did not move in long ago, and I barely have met them. Tonight, it escalated to a new level as I heard screams and cries (both male and female) of “get off of me”, “get the fuck out”, “you’re attacking me”, “give it back to me”, and more. The female who lives in this apartment is a family member of the landlord. Another neighbor went upstairs to diffuse the situation, and it calmed down. A few minutes later, it escalated to sobs of the above phrases, so I called the police. 

I need reassurance that I did the right thing. I barely know this couple, and because the girl is a relative of the landlord (he was nowhere to be found- tried him first), I honestly hesitated at first. I believe she has substance abuse issues and has been in trouble before. I would hate to make anything worse. I didn’t know what else to do- God forbid something went tragically wrong, I could not just look the other way and have that on my conscience.",domesticviolence

My brother seriously injured our father and I don't think I coped in a typical way. (Very long),"19F

Almost everyone in my family has been abused and has in turn abused. There's other fucked up shit like grandparents being related to each other and a host of medical and mental problems. Our mother abused us when we were younger for no reason, not that abusers ever need a reason to abuse. My goal since I was a child was just to get away from this fucked up family and never look back.

Our father never defended us from our mother, and I will never forgive him for that, but we grew closer over the last few years. At the same time, I don't really know what influenced my brother to become the abuser he is now. Sure, I am also full of rage about my mother's past abuse and how everyone denied it, justified it or made excuses. But it couldn't have just been that.

My brother has flunked school, started drinking and smoking weed, and doesn't try hard enough to not be a NEET. Besides that, about 2 years ago he started assaulting our mother and breaking objects, including stuff he needs. He assaulted our mother during last Christmas lunch in front of my mum's side of the family. He even started to scream at me and insult me for being too 'smart' and 'uppity' in conversations. Everyone thinks he's extremely jealous of me because I'm doing so well despite my circumstances.  Then recently we found out he's been smoking weed for the past few months and does not intend to stop it.

The worst thing is that sometimes I think the assaults are my fault. I try to talk to him as little as possible. But sometimes, it'll go from one of us asking to pass the salt, to my brother insulting me, and then him arguing with one of my parents, and someone assaulted or something broken.

My parents didn't want to go to the police because they didn't want him to have a criminal record. They attempted to make a report once but found a pretty shitty police service (normal in our area), so they didn't do it. At first my parents tried to discipline him. But it only made him more volatile. So then they just tried to help him. He never responded to anything, just kept getting worse and worse. He literally does what he likes and we can't control him.

As of now he's broken: 2 old but useful laptops, 3 new phones, his bathroom mirror, the fruit bowl, our stained glass door, 2 glasses, a jar of peanut butter, a computer, a fan, glass sheets on the furniture, damaged the furniture, a chair, a wifi router and my dad's nose.

The last 7 items all came from one instance yesterday, the worst it's ever been. As usual it started with something simple. Me and him got into an argument, over the weed and everything. Then my parents started to talk to him and took over the conversation. He started screaming and insulting my father, screaming that he's a faggot, pufta. My father just locked himself in the bedroom to get away from it. Then he and my mother argued for a minute before his screaming got out of control. He ran into the corridor, slammed the door almost off its hinges, grabbed the monitor and the chair there and threw them to our side of the corridor. They hit and broke the fan and the glass sheet on the furniture. That's when my father came out and shouted at him to get out. As usual they grappled, my father trying to force him out. My brother ended up punching him hard in the nose and ran out.

He punched him so hard there was blood spatter on the wall and black blood immediately started gushing, streaming out of his nose. There were blood drops on the floor all over the place, especially in the sink where he tried to get himself clean. As we were cleaning and the next day, we still found little droplets on random places like the TV screen. There was so much blood coming out we ended up calling the police for an ambulance. The ambulance never arrived (again, shitty police) so my mother went to take my dad to a clinic herself. 

I stayed home. My brother came to the door about 20 minutes after they left. He's been kicked out countless times and knows to take a very long walk or stay out for a few hours before even attempting to come back in. But lately he'd been trying to bash our door down when he got kicked out. He showed up with such nonchalance after being out for only an hour, and expected to be let back in. My parents told me not to let him in for my own safety and I didn't. I told him what they said, that they were never ever going to let him back in again and that he was a criminal, and I cursed at him to get out of there. He left.

And then I started recording the destruction that had occurred, all the damage and the blood in video. My dad usually records that stuff but I wanted to have my own personal record. It's a good thing I did because he was so shocked that he didn't record anything. The entire time I was so calm, I never shed one tear, if I cry then that's extremely rare for me. And I'm ashamed to say that while half my rage towards my brother was because of my dad's injury, the other half was because he broke the computer where I would play video games. 

At this time it was about 9 at night. I stayed up waiting for my parents, waiting to see if my brother got back, waiting to just see what would happen. I watched some Netflix just because nothing else could effectively distract me enough to pass the time. Then my parents came back at about 11. My dad got a doctor's certificate, certifying that his injury was grievous and that his nose had been broken. They had talked and decided that either my brother was going to co-operate with social workers and counselors or they would prosecute him in court to get him out of the house.

I went to sleep because I was so dead tired. In the morning I found out that my brother had not returned and was effectively missing. We waiting until 1 in the afternoon and were in the process of reporting him missing when he turned up. Apparently he walked to a friend's house and slept there (apparently this kid has parents who literally don't give two shits if their kid is smoking weed in the basement or letting in strangers in the middle of the night). We asked him if he felt any shame in causing them that trouble, and he said no, no surprise. My father's face had swelled up and both his eyes had turned black, my brother showed no empathy, never even said a sorry, just said he didn't mean it to cover his ass.

As of now we're in the process of cleaning up all the damage and throwing some things away, and my parents decided not to reveal when they'll be taking him to social services, but it'll be soon.

My brother is dead to me. DEAD. Any good relationship we might have had he decided to ruin it with his petty jealousy. And I will never forgive him for doing what he did to my father, and distracting me from my studies with his daily arguing and screaming and assaults. In the last 5 years I've never seen him show empathy to anyone, or any responsibility for his duties and actions. He is effectively a parasite in our home who will eventually tear it down piece by piece if we let him live here. And the worst part is our grandparents on both sides who keep coddling him and telling us to treat him kindly even though they know about a lot of the stuff that's happened.",domesticviolence

Abuse as a drug,,domesticviolence
My sister is emotionally abusive towards my parents and myself,"My sister (27) is emotionally abusive towards my parents and myself. I think she might have a mental illness but its hard to tell because she hasn't ever seen any therapist or psychologist about it. She refuses to speak to me ever, so I asked my mom to initiate the conversation with her to see a professional. My mother has spoken to her, and my sister agreed but then they both seemed to forget about it and nothing came of that. 

My mother (53) and my sister are close. My mother is easily manipulated. She's always been a rooter for the underdog and has always had the personality where she wants to help everyone. This is how my sister sucks her in. My mother listens to her sop stories about how life is so hard and her self esteem is just so low; then my mother falls for it. 

Noth my mom and sister have hysterical outbursts sometimes at various people in my family. Often times over silly, small things. If my sister is upset about something my mother acts as her lapdog and begins doing her bidding. They often gang up on myself and my dad. 

My father (60) is a little slow mentally, and old. He was not the best father or husband growing up and my sister harbours a deep hatred for him. She picks fights with him and my mom does her bidding. My sister is extremely controlling. For example, the other day she picked a fight with my dad because he opened to juice bottle on the dinner table before she could open it. 

This is taking its toll on both my mother and father, and possibly my sister too. My mother is developing an addiction to asprin and sleeps for most of the day. She also complains of physical ailments. My father has severe heart disease and is not taking it well either. 

I try to do my best to maintain a non-toxic environment, but its not working out. 

My sister still lives at home despite her age and is extremely toxic. She cant hold down a job and has no friends.",domesticviolence

"I know it's probably a phase, but it still hurts.","I've had many relationships in my life from a young child that led to me finding myself in an abusive relationship with my alcoholic ex (we dated from 2014-2018, me - f27-31, him - m34-38).  I do believe him to be a narcissist, which I definitely think came from the way he was raised.  He has a strong history of abuse, but as he gets older, he's getting a little tamer, and he's running out of options due to  living with his mother and being well over the age of being able to pull the same crap.  That being said, he got a DUI with our daughter and his previous two children earlier this year, and he's still being enabled, but he's also being tested.  He does really well when he stays in support groups and surrounds himself with positive influence rather than his friends that have the same habits of drinking/ruining lives.

Anyway.  Through a course of events, his current girlfriend reached out to me after seeing a post I shared on fb about covid and how it's been hard working at a long-term care facility because we're hurting and they are more my family than my own family has been and got me through an awful time in my life.  She asked if her boyfriend/my ex was my abuser.  I didn't give details, because I don't want to mess up anything good he's got going on (I need him to improve for our daughter), but part of me didn't want to scare her off because my daughter's safer if she's around.  She has kids, boys the same age as my older ones, and my ex - during child drop off - mentioned that one of them has anxiety issues.  Internally I freaked, because my mind went to my middle boy who's got adhd and struggles socially, talking to himself in the same manner my ex used to.  Having to discuss my ex's behavior with my ex-husband because it got brought up during sessions with their psychiatrist (adhd medication management).   I wanted nothing more than to not end up like my mom.  In some ways I haven't, and I'm proud of myself for that.  But I've got a long way to go to forgive myself for not putting them first and getting them away from that environment sooner.  Every move I make now is to ensure a peaceful home environment and luckily they have a lot of support all around, so they'll be okay I think.  I do talk to them about stuff that happened and why abuse occurs and that we can't hold on to anger towards that person, we just have to hope that they can heal whatever hurt them...and we don't have to spend time with people that don't make us feel good/scared, but we also don't have to hurt them or wish more on them. 

That being said, and maybe it's my inner child's lack of understanding - Covid has really put a hamper on finding a therapist (I need in-person therapy - I have adhd myself, if you haven't noticed yet lol, so phone stuff is difficult) but what if this isn't a phase?

What if he actually changes?

Obviously, that would be the most amazing thing - my dad went on to raise another family and I don't want that for her, so he HAS to change in order for that to be successful...

I know that a lot of these things were not a result of who I am as a person, and I don't allow behavior that isn't productive so I feel like I've got a decent grip on the logical side of things...but right now, with not being able to properly do my job (activities in a retirement/long-term care facility), feeling like I failed my kids (I'm much less patient than I used to be, I'm really working on that), my mental and physical health being out of sorts from years of neglect due to trying to survive on top of autoimmune thyroid issues, adhd, only having one hand with my residual limb starting to suffer overuse after 13 years, and not being able to see a professional - it's hitting me a little harder that he's treating her so well.  

I'm not a bad person, and while math isn't my strong suit - I can still count to 15 depending on my shoe choice - and I understand common denominators.  I know I have value.  But, why wasn't I worth being treated better?  The thought of an apology makes me horrendously sad, because it won't fix anything.  I love what I have now.  But I still lost regular access to seeing his two kids that I formed a relationship with, and now I have to share time with my sweet baby and nothing will ever change that, no matter how well he treats people from here on out.  That makes me really sad, and I don't know why.",domesticviolence
My black neighbor is beating his white girlfriend and I don't know what to do given the current political climate.,"My neighbor moved in two weeks before the lockdown happened.  This is an almost an exclusively white neighborhood.  When we met he spoke about how there were racists in his last apartment complex and I assured him that my girlfriend and I and the other tenant were not racist.

About two weeks after he moved in, we heard him and girlfriend yelling at each other.  Sometimes it was during the day, sometimes it would be in the middle of the night.  We never said anything because we didn't know how to address it.  We told the landlord a few times about it and we don't know how he addressed it but he said he did.

Eventually we could hear things getting physical.  It sounded like there was a knock down drag out fight happening next door.  We called the cops.  When the cops came the couple had left the apartment to go for a walk and the cops couldn't really do anything.  As a white person, I was very hesitant to call the cops on a black man.  As far as I know he doesn't know we have called the cops.

There has been little noise coming from their apartment but we hear some things now and again.  When the girlfriend isn't wearing long sleeve shirts you can see the bruises on her arms.

Today I heard his girlfriend yell, ""stop, you're hurting me!""  We called the landlord and our landlord called him.  We could hear our neighbor yelling at the landlord that he was afraid for his life and that she is having medicine issues and it makes her scream.  He feels like everyone hates him and that we're playing around with his life.  Our landlord said he spoke with the girlfriend and she said she wasn't being abused.  Which I do not think that any victim would say they were being abused while the accused is in the same room.

We do not know how to resolve this issue.  We want to talk to them but they seem to not be admitting what's going on.  I could be wrong I suppose, maybe she's has an issue that makes her yell and scream in the middle of the night when no one is abusing her.   I don't want to call the cops on a black man where things could escalate and he could be killed.  I don't want to do nothing and let either one of them hurt the other one.  Its causing us real emotional distress having to listen to it.  It doesn't seem like it's a good idea to confront your neighbors about how one of them is being abused or how they might be abusing each other.

We don't know what to do.",domesticviolence

"Damned if I do, damned if I don't..","Warning long story. If this is the wrong community, please advice me for the right one so that I can move this post.

I have lived in an abusive relationship for about 5 years now and finally got rid of him in a few months ago. It went far (as usual with this guy) and he got a restraining order, after I called the cops on him ( I really had to, he was drunk and was chasing me in my own apt). 

But this was not the first time. It has happened 7 or 8 times before that he has gone violent on me to the point that I had to call the police. I know l, I've been stupid to take him back but trust me, ge is a master manipulator and said all the right things when he was ""sorry"". 

He used to get drunk or high and made me break up with him since he was a coward and couldn't do it. I hope you get the picture here. All of this has been very painful to me, bc I really loved him. I have now, since the last time he fucked up, decided to never take him back again and kept my promise. 

He hasn't contacted me, but i know that is only bc there is a restraining order on him. I'm sure he'll reach out one way or another and do as usual, beg me to come back for he has changed an so on. 

I now understand that he never loved me and only wanted to owe me and use my energy so I promised myself to not give him another second of my life.

Then came the call. Today, the day after my birthday and it was my lawyer, telling me that the cops want to speak to me one last time and then they have enough to prosecute him and it will go to court. The probability of him getting a jail sentence is high. 

Now comes the dilemma. I want to leave this behind. I'm happy I have the restraining order so he won't come near for another 4 months at least , but I am so so afraid. If I do proceed with this, it will take more of my time and energy that I really don't want to put in this bs anymore, cuz I'm so tired of this drama, but if I don't do it he probably won't leave me alone.

Wtf should I do. I study at uni and really want to focus on that. That's really all I want to do. I just want him to leave me alone.",domesticviolence
So I kinda need advice (I also posted this on another subreddit),"So my mom started “kinda” abusing me a while ago here’s why I say kinda
So she first started by standing on me when she thought I was pregnant even though I was just twelve back then (a few months ago) and I had no boyfriend and it was just and irregular period (she didn’t even let me take the test) 
But then after wards she started doing stuff like trying to stab me with scissors, chasing me trough the house with knives, threatening to kill me, forcing me to take 3 strips of birth control....cause she thought I was pregnant and we are already involved with cps (they don’t know about this) and she doesn’t want my brothers (and apparently me) to get taken away from her.. 
she was also diagnosed with psychosis a few years ago.. so she kinda has this weird story that’s she keeps on saying, that’s kinda like she thinks people can read her mind , if she sees anything on internet she pretends it’s aimed directly at her and says people are bullying her (it doesn’t even have to be bad) so once I heard yelling from downstairs and then she came to my door mad and kept on telling me to open it I was scared so I kept on saying stuff to stall like “why?” “I don’t want to if ur gonna hurt me...” she ended up kicking the door open and strangling me...
She’s hit me with a broom/mop stick before 
A piece of wood (it broke, but she used the excuse that it was already breaking even though I’m sure it wasn’t) etc.
But it’s like sometimes she’s like that and other times she’s acting as if she loves me...
Like around two weeks ago is the last time she hurt me, my school changed the transportation for school and said that someone would drive the students that live far away (including me) but then changed it again and said that wasn’t gonna happen she got mad and started blaming me for it and went into my room yelling for me to call my homeroom teacher I was looking at her cuz other wise she’d probably find it disrespectful but at the same time hoping that she didn’t think I was rolling my eyes cuz she often says that I’m rolling my eyes at her when all I’m doing is just looking at her this time was no different she thought I was rolling my eyes and hit me with a plate she aimed for my head but I blocked it with my arm I got a bruise but it wasn’t that visible and I got a wound (kinda looking like a dot of blood but at the same time it wasn’t bleeding) she continued yelling at me.... 
but now around two weeks later she hasn’t hit me since then (she has insulted me once again for things I couldn’t possibly control) but today she apologized after asking why I wasn’t that close with her and seemed to be “unhappy with her” so I mentioned the fact that she strangled me and she blamed it on me said it was my fault cuz I did (once again something I couldn’t possibly control) anyway later she came to my room and just said she wanted to make up with me.. so she said just sorry and kept on talking my door was closed but she kept asking for me to open it.. eventually I got kinda tired of hearing the same thing over and over again so I opened my door cuz I knew she probably wasn’t gonna go away.. she kinda hugged me all happy like a little child when she said something like yay or yes she forgives me or something like that.. but idk she could start hurting me at anytime again.. also even if she doesn’t am I supposed to just let it go as if it never happened in the first place I feel like I’m being over dramatic for not just letting it go.. and even though she did all that a lot I barely got any bruises so was it really that bad? Also would anyone even believe me if I tell them with zero evidence... it’s not like I have nightmares or something.. sometimes I do think she’s gonna hit me again and I flinch but that’s really all....... 

(TL;DR: so my mom with psychosis started “disciplining”(for stuff I couldn’t control) (and threatening to kill me) me a while ago but the last time she did it was a few weeks ago and she apologized today, she could do it anytime again but could also not.. do idk what to do...btw I’m a 13 girl with two brothers..and my dad lives in another city he’s coming to visit tomorrow tho..(before This she acted abusive towards my stepdad (who would never hurt her btw) but he committed... a few years ago also I don’t live in the US so the rules might be a bit different here)",domesticviolence

Can't do it alone,,domesticviolence
Do I even have the right to be mad? (Mental health issues as an explanation for abusive behavior),"This is going to be a really long one, but if anyone can stick with it, I’d really appreciate it. 

(Some background information: I’m transgender female-to-male and had been struggling a long time with my sexuality)

I dated a guy (we’ll call him Michael) for 11 months. I knew going into the relationship that he identified as asexual and I was fine with that. A little while into the relationship, Michael told me that he was a survivor of sexual assault and had PTSD. He told me his triggers, and I made sure to avoid them at all costs. A few months into the relationship, Michael expressed that he was interested in trying sexual things with me. We went slow — I made sure I never pressured him to do anything he didn’t want to, I avoided his triggers, and frequently checked to see if everything was alright. Everything was going fine — sometimes he’d get upset or overwhelmed, but we’d stop immediately and I’d always be there to comfort him. Eventually he got a lot more comfortable with sex so it happened more often. Then the end of the semester came (we’re both in college), and he began getting really stressed. 

He was in crisis just about every day. I tried to be there for him whenever he was upset, but it was becoming extremely taxing on me and my own mental health. It got to the point that I couldn’t take it anymore, so I told him I was feeling extremely emotionally worn out and asked him to find someone else to talk to about his issues. He apologized, but he didn’t stop. In fact, it got worse. The smallest thing could send him into deep self loathing to the point that I was extremely afraid of saying anything that might set him off. He had hurt himself in front of me before, so I was always afraid of what he might do if I spoke up about how basically being his therapist was affecting me.

Needless to say, I was more than relieved when summer cam around and I could go back to my home all the way across the country. Over the summer, I finally started passing as male. I also started to realize that I didn’t feel comfortable with the romantic side of my relationship with Michael and came out to him as aromantic. He agreed to stop doing very overtly romantic things in order to make me more comfortable. However, he didn’t stop — he kept doing things that I was uncomfortable with, becoming inconsolable when I’d confront him, and telling me that it was his depression/PTSD that was making it hard for him to remember. I figured that I couldn’t be angry with him since it was his mental illness and was beyond his control, so I just sucked it up and didn’t say anything about it again. 

Summer ended and I went back to school for the fall. A month or two later, I realized I was also very uncomfortable with the sexual side of our relationship as well and ended up I coming out to him as asexual. We agreed that we’d have more of a dedicated partnership than a romantic relationship and that we wouldn’t do anything else sexual because I told him I was extremely uncomfortable with it. 

But again, even though he was a sexual assault survivor who was always pushing consent, he didn’t stop sexual advances. It would start gradually enough that I wouldn’t realize until it was too late (for example, we’d be laying down with each other in bed and suddenly I’d realize his hands were where I didn’t want them to be). At this point, I wanted to say no, but then I’d remember how he had banged his head against the wall as self-punishment and thought he didn’t deserve to live for forgetting to turn on the fan above the stove — what would he do if I told him he had done something sexual to me without his consent? Or implied that he had done the same thing that the person who assaulted him did? He had told me from the beginning of the relationship that that was his greatest fear. 

So, afraid of what he might do to himself if I spoke up, I just let it happen. I’d even comfort him afterwards when he’d get upset and tell me that he hadn’t even wanted to do it. It made absolutely no sense to me since I had asked for us to stop doing sexual things for an indefinite amount of time and now here I was, having to comfort him after he had gone ahead with sex anyways and then claimed he never wanted to do it in the first place. This happened a few times, and I blamed myself for having somehow probably pressured him — why else would he have done it? He was asexual after all, right? Anyways, I ended up breaking up with him after winter break when I realized that I wasn’t aromantic or asexual, I just liked women instead of men (at one point in my life liking women was considered gay since I was living as a girl, so bad reactions from others had pushed me to believe I was bisexual). 

I blocked Michael on every social media platform I could think of, but ended up confronting him through tumblr messaging, telling him what he had done to me and the damage it had caused. He replied by saying “I was trapped in my worst memories, and it made it hard to remember where I was, who I was with, what was talked about”. 

Now I’m trying to figure out how much he can really be held accountable for what he did. On one hand, he created an environment where saying no could be dangerous and he also initiated sex after I had withdrawn consent indefinitely. On the other hand, he had severe mental health issues. I’m struggling to figure out if I’m allowed to put the blame on him and how much his mental health issues made it so that it really wasn’t his fault. 

So basically, is he still to blame even if his mental health issues made him forget all those things? Or is it even possible that depression, PTSD, or OCD can make you forget things like that? (For context, he was still able to do fine in classes and didn’t seem extremely mentally impaired)",domesticviolence

A Letter To My Abusive Ex.,"An Open Letter To My Abusive Ex.

There was at time I felt safe with you by my side, there weren't many but this one I will carry always. See, people ask me why did you stay with him through all of that. That isn't an easy thing to explain to those who've never experienced violence and gas-lighting to the extent of diminishment of self. 
I guess I held onto that moment for deeper than I should have, perhaps because it was the only glisten of humanity I saw, even though it was for yourself. 
I was in labour with our son, far earlier than what doctors decide is viable life. We were in the hospital watching the clock, timing. You were there by my side. You were holding me telling me everything was going to be okay. You were my rock when I needed it the most. I know now that you didn't do it for me. That was an act for you and your observers because we both know that in their notes, your actions were the reason we were there.

When I look back, it is so blatantly clear. You were the hunter, I was your prey.

You used my fears and my secrets I confided to you, to chip away at my self, to wear me down and groom me into a drudge you controlled.

At every glisten of me you would suppress, with your words, your hands, and your prick. Every action, every utterance you did, stripped another layer from my spirit, what it was to be me, to live.

I couldn't see it then, I believed your lies that something must be wrong with me, though I see it now. Through your demons you battered me until who I was, was gone.

You had this power of forging me into believing everything you said, that I deserved it, that I was stupid, that I was worthless if not for that act you used against me, that I was fucked in the head.

You stripped me, in all ways, back to my bones. I had become nothing other than a shell and your slave. Even then though it wasn't good enough, you had taken away my family, my friends, marked my sanity and deprived my dignity. You still wanted more, so that Wednesday in May, you took my light too.

I was resigned. I had succumbed to your whim, this was all I am for the rest of my life until you decide my body was expendable too. I mattered no more and just waited for my death at your hands. When that didn't come (yet), you lost the control. I got out.

No longer could your words, or your fists or that grip on my wrist make me do what you wanted.

You couldn't bear people knowing all that you had done, how dare I tell. So you took that fear you induced, you took that pain you caused, you took my secrets I shared and tried to spread them in shame. You told the world trauma you inflicted on me was made up in my mind, you fought against onus and still do to this day, in your words by your postings ""I will win"".

Oh but honey, this isn't a game.

I know that in reading this, if you are ever compelled to, it probably turns you on. A small list of your achievements, you won't read this as ever having done anything wrong.
Though this isn't that. I'm not asking for recognition nor is it a gift of forgiveness, no. You don't deserve a place of peace in my heart and I don't care to give it because I am not afraid, I've already lived in hell.

I want you to know that in fact, in some way, I am grateful. See, without being completely broken I wouldn't have been able to build up. I couldn't have breathed without feeling safe, I couldn't have smiled without feeling happiness deep, I couldn't have felt without knowing strength. If not for all the torture you forced me through, I couldn't have become who I am today, proud, strong, brave and unashamed.

I did that.

You are nothing without triumph of my defeat. I am everything you don't want in me, and everything you wish people thought you could be.

I stand tall through the trauma, and the venom you spit. I'm unwavering in your last battle to make me quit because thanks to you, I have nothing to fear.
You have a lifetime of self vindicating, a lifetime of justifying incidences you won't admit but I, I have light and I have power, I own my shit. 

Its not my shame, it's yours.",domesticviolence
Family members try to fight me because I don’t let them control me.,So I’ve been the bread winner of my family for like 5 years I’m a 25 year old female who lives with my mom sister and my boyfriend. I don’t bother anyone I pretty much stay in my room and go to work. I only moved my boyfriend in to help me with bills since my mom and sister doesn’t want to get a job. They have a problem with anything me and my boyfriend do for example they have issues with what we spend our money on and places we go another example is if anything comes up missing they blame it on my boyfriend then find the items and never apologize. I never make big deals about It I just move on from it. Just recently I was on the phone talking to my friend and my sister comes banging at my door asking me why I’m talking about her which I wasn’t but even if I was how dare you break my door down and try to fight me over something your not sure is really going on. I’m very laid back I try to laugh everyday and be happy and people hate seeing that so they try to do anything to get me down. They only try to bother me when my boyfriend is at work which is funny. I feel like their jealous and bored with their lives so they want to bother me because they know I don’t like confrontation. I feel like they project all their insecurities onto me.

I’m really just talking about my problems here cause I have no one else to talk to..,"So I posted something in the night a few hours ago at like 1 am or something I’ve already deleted it by now but... it was just me explaining what my mom did.. and people were saying that it’s abuse if you haven’t seen the post (wich most likely you haven’t) I’m a 13 year old girl and I live with my mom and my older and younger brother.. my mom got diagnosed with psychosis a few years ago after we got involved with CPS they never really told us but I hear them talking about it and I found some medication that used used to treat that...(I was searching for something and came across it and googled it cuz I was curious) and also my mom has a certain way of saying that they diagnosed her.. so recently a few months ago she started (I’m so uncomfortable with the word) abusing me... the last time she hit me was two weeks ago with a plate long story short she said that I was rolling my eyes at her (I don’t know why but she always thinks that almost anytime I just look at her) yesterday... she was asking why I seemed “distant” or seemed like I didn’t really like her... so I mentioned something that happend a while ago where she strangled me.. at first she blamed it on me and said it was my fault for (something I didn’t do but she thought I did) then I went to my room and later she came and apologized... she kept on asking me to open my door eventually I did and she just hugged me and thought I forgave her I just went along with it my brothers seem to not be too bothered by any of it (they even made fun of me a few times when she hurt me) it’s like sometimes she’s just my mom and other times she hates me...

Some people in the replies kinda warned me that she’d probably do it again.. today I got scared and thought she would so this morning she got really mad because she found my older brothers keys outside and they’ve been there since yesterday she got really upset and said that anyone could’ve entered our house she started yelling at my brother who also got really mad and said that he wasn’t the one that left the keys there she said that they were his keys and he was responsible for it and he quickly tried to blame me for leaving the keys outside but I have my own keys and didn’t use his and he knows that but still started hitting and kicking my door trying to open it and threatening me all because he was tryna but my moms attention and the blame on me so he wouldn’t be yelled at or blamed for it then my mom came upstairs and he went to his room upset and then my mom started hitting and kicking my door (and blaming me for stuff that didn’t happen and I couldn’t control that also had nothing to do with the situation) I got scared because it reminded me of all the times she did that wich always led to her hurting me eventually she kicked it open like she always does she was upset but didn’t hurt me (luckily) but I could’ve made one wrong move and she would’ve... in that moment I did really wish I told someone because I got really scared but after wards I couldn’t imagine telling anyone...(i know it isn’t but it just really feels embarrassing)


so I didn’t really know what to do people in the replies from last night told me to tell someone.. but I don’t really know who I’m gonna tell... some people said my teacher but my mom chose to make me stay home because of the virus so I don’t go to school... and telling them online just seems awkward and I can’t even imagine how they’d react.
Then some people said to tell my dad.. but he only comes and visits sometimes and sometimes I text him but he doesn’t read the messages cuz he didn’t get them he was supposed to visit today but didn’t show up..(butmy mom and him are calling and playing a game with my little brother rn while my older brother plays a games with his friend) 
And then some people said tell you’re social worker well... I’ve really seen multiple people and honestly those are all people from CPS or they work close to them and I always tell them everything’s fine so telling any of them is just..embarrassing or awkward for me I don’t know how to talk to people well.. I’m always worried what they think of me.. also even though I’ve seen them a couple of times over the years it almost feels like they’re strangers.. and whenever I see them my moms there... and I have literally no evidence at all to show that what I’m saying is true I have like one bruise that’s almost completely gone and you can barely see so now I’m worried about who to tell.. how to tell them.. whether they’re gonna believe me or not..and how they’re gonna react and what they’re gonna do if I tell them.....and also people have it worse than me... the last time she hurt me was a while ago would it really count......
I know everything I said probably sounds irrational like why don’t I just tell someone why am I being like this... 
Okay so that was it for me ranting about my problems....

Living with an abusive alcoholic father.,"Hi, so this is my first Reddit account so apologies if I format things wrong or anything along those lines I just need somewhere to vent where it's completely anonymous.

I'm a just turned 18 year old male living in the UK and living with an abusive father and I honestly just don't know what to do and feel like I need to vent. My father's Ex-Navy and has been an alcoholic for as long as I can remember.

 I'm living here at the moment because it's easier for me to get to and from college and it's a quiet place to get my coursework done but I literally don't think I can handle living here anymore. He's drinking up 3+ bottles of wine a day every single day during this lockdown and is gradually getting worse. He's physically violent to me at times to the point where he's scarred/cut me on multiple occasions, he's beat me, said homophobic things to me, gaslit me.  

I don't know whether to stick it out for the next year until I can get into a university far away from here or find somewhere else to stay. I'm just so confused and scared.",domesticviolence

Living with abusive father on isolated farm.,"Hi so this is my very first post here, the reason I decided to reach out is that im scared to death.
Some background: my mother passed , from breast cancer when I was 6, my father remarried  immediately, my step mom, father and step grandmother would physically abuse me on a regular basis. Eventually my father also started abusing my step mom, he nearly killed her twice. This continued till I was 16 and they separated. I was shipped off to boarding school, happiest two years of my life. After school got over, I joined college in a neighbouring city, things have been fine the last three years when I lived by myself. Now due to the coronavirus pandemic I'm forced to live with my father in an isolated farm, he has started abusing me again on a daily basis. Threatened to kill me on multiple occasions. I'm scared and don't know what to do. He's far too powerful for me to complain to the police, he absolutely faced no consequences for landing his wife in the hospital. I have no way out right now, I'm a student with no resources and can't just leave home. I'm from India, so me on the streets wouldn't be the best idea. Thank you so much for taking the time to read, more than anything I needed to get this off my chest.

Abusive ex won't stop harassing me even with a restraining order.,"4 months ago I went to the police to press charges and get a restraining order. My ex narc was silent the entire time up until last week. I guess he was waiting for things to ""die down"" before he makes an INDIRECT appearance? 

A week ago, I received texts from Amazon but my number isn't associated with my account. 

Yesterday, I received 40+ international calls. This is not no damn coincidence. This guy is annoying as hell. I'm changing my number but should I tell the police? I suspect he posted my number somewhere and these mfs won't stop calling. They call every 5 minutes! 

Can somebody tell me what my next steps are?! I have no evidence that it's him. &amp; I think that's why he's doing it this way so he doesn't violate the restraining order.

My (20F) stepdad (39M) threatened to kill my mother (36F) during an argument.,"A little long, TLDR at the bottom. This is my first time posting in this sub, the mods from r/relationships sent me to you guys. Please forgive any irregularities. 

I recently moved back in with my parents. They fight. A lot. Nasty, screaming-match fights that can last for days. They had a child last year which has naturally created new tensions in the house, mostly because my stepfather contributes substantially less to childcare than my mother. It's obvious he loves the baby, but he often leaves my mother to do 70–90% of the grunt work (e.g. napping while she's in tears from back pain and needs help with the baby, spending hours at the gym/not adjusting any part of his pre-baby schedule, etc.) They are both currently unemployed and basically in the house together 24/7. To be honest it's clear that he's not equally contributing and it's grinding her down, but they don't communicate well at all and the whole situation is generating a lot of resentment. He is currently doing CBT therapy for anger management, which was a stipulation of an ultimatum my mother apparently gave him to avoid divorce. Couples therapy is not currently an option for insurance reasons.

A few months ago he purchased a rifle for home defense. I believe it's an AR-15. It is not in a safe. It stays beside their bed in the case it was purchased in. The other week, they got into an argument that ended with my stepdad storming out of the house. My mom broke down in front of me and admitted that he recently said to her ""I should shoot you in the fucking head"" while they were having a fight. Guys, I don't have the words to describe what hearing that felt like. It was a sickening, primal fear. My face must have given me away because she instantly regretted telling me, and spent the next half hour reassuring me that she felt completely safe and knew for a fact that he would never harm her. But what mother wouldn't?

My stepdad has never struck me as the violent type. He's a bit more confrontational than my mother and I, but I've always attributed that to his hailing from a more urban, crowded part of the country than us. I have always felt completely and totally safe around him. He has been in my life since I was a teenager, and I've come to view him as my true father, which only makes this worse. I feel guilty for the fears that I'm having. He has done so much for me, and has supported me in so many ways, and here I am, scared that he might harm my mom or my sibling or all of us. I will say that he is ex-military (non-combat) and ex-NFL, and we have suspected for some time that he may suffer from CTE.

I am physically ill with paranoia. They have been screaming most of the day, and with every lull in the argument I'm terrified that I will hear gunshots. I know this is very macabre, and it might just be my anxiety rearing its ugly head, but my quality of life has dropped significantly since this began. I don't have a big biological family. My mother and sibling are all I have, and if something were to happen to them, my life would be over. I just don't know what to do. My mom is financially dependent on him, and she does not have a degree. If I were to do anything that would remove either of them from this house, she and the baby (and myself) would be homeless and without any money. And although I feel horribly selfish even thinking about my own situation, this is really taxing me emotionally. I'm trying to get through college while also working part-time, and now I have this nightmarish anxiety always waiting for me at home. On top of that, I'm often left to care for the baby in a separate room while they fight. I can't do it all. It's eating me up.

My longterm boyfriend (24M) who, admittedly, is much more level-headed and much less anxious than I am, is trying to reassure me that my stepdad wouldn't hurt my mother. He thinks it was purely a heat of the moment anger that spilled out, and perhaps a result of my stepdad's military/police training. And really, I have never once felt unsafe around my stepfather until this happened. But I'm trying to look at the facts here, which are:

* There is a gun in the house that is in plain sight at all times, not in a safe.
* They are having bitter, drawn out fights every other week or so, often within the same space as the weapon.
* They are constantly in close proximity with little reprieve from one another.
* He has impulsively threatened to shoot her.
* It is possible that he has suffered brain injuries that can impact decision-making.
* Also a fact is that the best predictor of future behavior is past behavior, and my stepdad has never laid a hand on my mother (that I know of.)

What do I do? What *can* I do? What *should* I do? Am I overreacting? Any advice will be appreciated so much. 

TLDR; My stepdad threatened to shoot my mother in the head during a recent argument. He owns a gun which he doesn't keep locked up. They are having intense arguments several times a month, primarily surrounding tensions caused by my new baby sibling. He has never hurt me or my mother, and is by all accounts a kind person, but the paranoia is wearing me down. Neither my mother nor myself are in a position to leave the house, and I don't even know if that's something that should be considered. I am juggling school, work, the fear of my mother being harmed, and the responsibility of caring for my sibling while they fight. I am overwhelmed, scared, and confused. I need some guidance.",domesticviolence
My boyfriend raped me. I want to understand why.,"CROSS POSTED, throw away account 

Last night my boyfriend and father of my child raped me. It was my birthday. My first night out, baby with a sitter, for the first time in over a year. I got intoxicated and a took one single hit of weed. I was unable to walk, I had slurred speech, confusion, and I think I periodically passed out. My boyfriend was pretty much sober, however. 
He brought me to bed and I was laying on my back. At first I thought I was dreaming when I realized he wasn’t listening to me saying “no “ repeatedly. I used my arms to try and push him away. I said I don’t want this, I don’t know who you are, and even cried “rape” over and over. Nothing stopped him. I couldn’t believe he could be capable of this. I remember crying “no, not YOU! Not you not you!” Because I never imagined he was capable of this... 
This morning I woke up and sat up in disbelief. I wanted to believe it was a nightmare. But he woke up to. He seemed irritated and asked if I remember last night. I said I had a bad dream. He said it was real, that I kept crying rape, saying no, that I don’t know him. So there’s no doubt in my mind that this all happened. But I’m shocked that he so readily confessed to it like he doesn’t see a problem ?! He admits I was blacked out, didn’t want sex, cried rape, but he chose to continue anyway. I feel numb, scared, and confused. Just, why? Why would he do this? I feel betrayed, violated, and lost.",domesticviolence
boyfriend slapped me for the first time and claims he doesn't remember,"Ok guys this might be a long post, but I'm in a bad situation. I need advice and your opinions/ and any personal experience you might have relating to my situation. I've {female 21 yr} been dating my boyfriend {male 20yrs} for about 2 years, its been up and down definitely toxic at times, but recently as we've both been going to therapy and getting help we have been better than ever. Some background on my boyfriend, his father is very abusive and has been his whole life, he still lives with his parents &amp; his environment at home is usually very toxic. Yesterday I was over at his parents house and we were watching a show in his room, his younger sister {shes 9 years old} came and watched it with us, my boyfriend fell asleep quickly so I let him be and am just enjoying the show with his little sister. As time passes its about 8pm, I decide to wake him up because I know that he won't be able to fall asleep later that night if he keeps napping. Hes probably been asleep for about an hour and a half maybe more, so I gently wake him &amp; hes pretty grumpy and annoyed. I explain to him that I just wanted him to be able to fall asleep later and that it was getting late. He's still half asleep and I let him be for a few mins- i lovingly put my head on his and nudge him a few times (I can see how that would be annoying but its out of love) he then gets very angry and raises his voice telling me to cut it out. I tell him I have to go soon and want to hangout with him before I go and I nudge him again. He rolls over facing me and backhands me in the face, it was hard. Sometimes we play rough but this was uncalled for and it really hurt. When he slapped me obviously his sister heard it and she put her hand on my face and said hes a meanie, but maybe she thought we were just playing around. A few seconds passed by and my boyfriend didn't do or say anything, I was furious like blood boiling angry and hurt. So I get up and go to the restroom worried I would cry in front of his sister. After I get my stuff I say I'm going home, I did not want to be there as it was only past 8pm my boyfriend and his sister are surprised because I usually stay later. I walk out and head to my car. My boyfriend has the audacity to ask why I'm leaving and I'm dumbfounded. I even say are you fucking kidding me you slapped me in the face &amp; you did it in front of your little sister? He says he doesn't REMEMBER slapping me and that it was on accident and points out that nothing like this has ever happened before. I keep my distance and don't say much after he gives his speech saying he's sorry and bs he tries to tell me to come inside. HELL no he asks for a hug and I say no thanks and I get in my car and leave. He has never hit me before, although his slap was hard it didn't cause damage to my face, but I feel so disrespected and that its a huuuuge red flag. He keeps saying he loves me, that he's sorry and that it was an accident. Am I stupid to believe him? Because part of me wants to and then my rational side kicks in and smells the bullshit. Should I leave him? I may have low self-worth but something like this I will not stand for or forgive. They say once your partner hits you most likely they will again and I'm afraid that if I don't leave that it will. Tell me your thoughts please, as this happened yesterday I am still coming to terms with everything. Is this considered abuse? What do I do?",domesticviolence
PTSD is haunting my new relationship and I fear I’m destroying it. Advice?,"Brief back-story: My (F29) now ex-husband was incredibly abusive. Physically, mentally, emotionally and financially. He’s currently facing 20 years because he tried to kill me. This was just under a year ago (we separated over a year ago) and, while I have come to terms with what happened, the emotional and physical scars still exist. I have been formally diagnosed with ptsd - the effects of which I am still learning to recognize and cope with. 

After I moved to a new city, found a job, my own place, got a dog and became settled I met and became friends with a man through work. After his relationship ended we started dating (it’s been almost 3 months). We were close when we were friends and are even closer now. 

He treats me well, he is kind to me and others, he helps the local community and is hard-working. Even so, I find myself sabotaging our relationship because of my past. I am easily triggered and I find ways to ‘hate’ him. I nit-pick his actions trying to somehow uncover his eventual abuse in some kind of “ta-da, gotcha” type way. 

People always say “trust your gut” but I don’t know what that looks like any more. I’m always second guessing myself to the point that it feels like I’m gaslighting....myself. I don’t trust him when I am triggered nor do I trust myself. I feel like I’m going crazy. 

I name-call (he does not) and yell (he does not). It’s like I have become the abuser because I am so used to having to constantly be on the defense. I don’t want to be this way, feel this way or treat him this way. I don’t want to be the reason our relationship fails. 

He is incredibly supportive and has said he will work to build my trust and to understand my triggers. I feel like such a burden and so pathetic - my need to feel strong and how I try to achieve that is my weakness. 

I need advice, stories, experiences. I’m so inside my head that I don’t even feel like myself.",domesticviolence

Bystander who called the cops- Did I do the right thing?,"The couple who lives directly above me often argue. There are typically lots of thuds. They did not move in long ago, and I barely have met them. Tonight, it escalated to a new level as I heard screams and cries (both male and female) of “get off of me”, “get the fuck out”, “you’re attacking me”, “give it back to me”, and more. The female who lives in this apartment is a family member of the landlord. Another neighbor went upstairs to diffuse the situation, and it calmed down. A few minutes later, it escalated to sobs of the above phrases, so I called the police. 

I need reassurance that I did the right thing. I barely know this couple, and because the girl is a relative of the landlord (he was nowhere to be found- tried him first), I honestly hesitated at first. I believe she has substance abuse issues and has been in trouble before. I would hate to make anything worse. I didn’t know what else to do- God forbid something went tragically wrong, I could not just look the other way and have that on my conscience.",domesticviolence

He then threatened to punch me in the face and i told him i “dared him” and to see what happens if he does. now my mom wants him out of the house with nowhere to go. what do i do in this situation? should i call the cops?",domesticviolence
My brother seriously injured our father and I don't think I coped in a typical way. (Very long),"19F

Almost everyone in my family has been abused and has in turn abused. There's other fucked up shit like grandparents being related to each other and a host of medical and mental problems. Our mother abused us when we were younger for no reason, not that abusers ever need a reason to abuse. My goal since I was a child was just to get away from this fucked up family and never look back.

Our father never defended us from our mother, and I will never forgive him for that, but we grew closer over the last few years. At the same time, I don't really know what influenced my brother to become the abuser he is now. Sure, I am also full of rage about my mother's past abuse and how everyone denied it, justified it or made excuses. But it couldn't have just been that.

My brother has flunked school, started drinking and smoking weed, and doesn't try hard enough to not be a NEET. Besides that, about 2 years ago he started assaulting our mother and breaking objects, including stuff he needs. He assaulted our mother during last Christmas lunch in front of my mum's side of the family. He even started to scream at me and insult me for being too 'smart' and 'uppity' in conversations. Everyone thinks he's extremely jealous of me because I'm doing so well despite my circumstances.  Then recently we found out he's been smoking weed for the past few months and does not intend to stop it.

The worst thing is that sometimes I think the assaults are my fault. I try to talk to him as little as possible. But sometimes, it'll go from one of us asking to pass the salt, to my brother insulting me, and then him arguing with one of my parents, and someone assaulted or something broken.

My parents didn't want to go to the police because they didn't want him to have a criminal record. They attempted to make a report once but found a pretty shitty police service (normal in our area), so they didn't do it. At first my parents tried to discipline him. But it only made him more volatile. So then they just tried to help him. He never responded to anything, just kept getting worse and worse. He literally does what he likes and we can't control him.

As of now he's broken: 2 old but useful laptops, 3 new phones, his bathroom mirror, the fruit bowl, our stained glass door, 2 glasses, a jar of peanut butter, a computer, a fan, glass sheets on the furniture, damaged the furniture, a chair, a wifi router and my dad's nose.

The last 7 items all came from one instance yesterday, the worst it's ever been. As usual it started with something simple. Me and him got into an argument, over the weed and everything. Then my parents started to talk to him and took over the conversation. He started screaming and insulting my father, screaming that he's a faggot, pufta. My father just locked himself in the bedroom to get away from it. Then he and my mother argued for a minute before his screaming got out of control. He ran into the corridor, slammed the door almost off its hinges, grabbed the monitor and the chair there and threw them to our side of the corridor. They hit and broke the fan and the glass sheet on the furniture. That's when my father came out and shouted at him to get out. As usual they grappled, my father trying to force him out. My brother ended up punching him hard in the nose and ran out.

He punched him so hard there was blood spatter on the wall and black blood immediately started gushing, streaming out of his nose. There were blood drops on the floor all over the place, especially in the sink where he tried to get himself clean. As we were cleaning and the next day, we still found little droplets on random places like the TV screen. There was so much blood coming out we ended up calling the police for an ambulance. The ambulance never arrived (again, shitty police) so my mother went to take my dad to a clinic herself. 

I stayed home. My brother came to the door about 20 minutes after they left. He's been kicked out countless times and knows to take a very long walk or stay out for a few hours before even attempting to come back in. But lately he'd been trying to bash our door down when he got kicked out. He showed up with such nonchalance after being out for only an hour, and expected to be let back in. My parents told me not to let him in for my own safety and I didn't. I told him what they said, that they were never ever going to let him back in again and that he was a criminal, and I cursed at him to get out of there. He left.

And then I started recording the destruction that had occurred, all the damage and the blood in video. My dad usually records that stuff but I wanted to have my own personal record. It's a good thing I did because he was so shocked that he didn't record anything. The entire time I was so calm, I never shed one tear, if I cry then that's extremely rare for me. And I'm ashamed to say that while half my rage towards my brother was because of my dad's injury, the other half was because he broke the computer where I would play video games. 

At this time it was about 9 at night. I stayed up waiting for my parents, waiting to see if my brother got back, waiting to just see what would happen. I watched some Netflix just because nothing else could effectively distract me enough to pass the time. Then my parents came back at about 11. My dad got a doctor's certificate, certifying that his injury was grievous and that his nose had been broken. They had talked and decided that either my brother was going to co-operate with social workers and counselors or they would prosecute him in court to get him out of the house.

I went to sleep because I was so dead tired. In the morning I found out that my brother had not returned and was effectively missing. We waiting until 1 in the afternoon and were in the process of reporting him missing when he turned up. Apparently he walked to a friend's house and slept there (apparently this kid has parents who literally don't give two shits if their kid is smoking weed in the basement or letting in strangers in the middle of the night). We asked him if he felt any shame in causing them that trouble, and he said no, no surprise. My father's face had swelled up and both his eyes had turned black, my brother showed no empathy, never even said a sorry, just said he didn't mean it to cover his ass.

As of now we're in the process of cleaning up all the damage and throwing some things away, and my parents decided not to reveal when they'll be taking him to social services, but it'll be soon.

My brother is dead to me. DEAD. Any good relationship we might have had he decided to ruin it with his petty jealousy. And I will never forgive him for doing what he did to my father, and distracting me from my studies with his daily arguing and screaming and assaults. In the last 5 years I've never seen him show empathy to anyone, or any responsibility for his duties and actions. He is effectively a parasite in our home who will eventually tear it down piece by piece if we let him live here. And the worst part is our grandparents on both sides who keep coddling him and telling us to treat him kindly even though they know about a lot of the stuff that's happened.",domesticviolence

Abuse as a drug,,domesticviolence
My sister is emotionally abusive towards my parents and myself,"My sister (27) is emotionally abusive towards my parents and myself. I think she might have a mental illness but its hard to tell because she hasn't ever seen any therapist or psychologist about it. She refuses to speak to me ever, so I asked my mom to initiate the conversation with her to see a professional. My mother has spoken to her, and my sister agreed but then they both seemed to forget about it and nothing came of that. 

My mother (53) and my sister are close. My mother is easily manipulated. She's always been a rooter for the underdog and has always had the personality where she wants to help everyone. This is how my sister sucks her in. My mother listens to her sop stories about how life is so hard and her self esteem is just so low; then my mother falls for it. 

Noth my mom and sister have hysterical outbursts sometimes at various people in my family. Often times over silly, small things. If my sister is upset about something my mother acts as her lapdog and begins doing her bidding. They often gang up on myself and my dad. 

My father (60) is a little slow mentally, and old. He was not the best father or husband growing up and my sister harbours a deep hatred for him. She picks fights with him and my mom does her bidding. My sister is extremely controlling. For example, the other day she picked a fight with my dad because he opened to juice bottle on the dinner table before she could open it. 

This is taking its toll on both my mother and father, and possibly my sister too. My mother is developing an addiction to asprin and sleeps for most of the day. She also complains of physical ailments. My father has severe heart disease and is not taking it well either. 

I try to do my best to maintain a non-toxic environment, but its not working out. 

My sister still lives at home despite her age and is extremely toxic. She cant hold down a job and has no friends.",domesticviolence

How do I approach a friend in an abusive relationship?,"My boyfriend and I are friends with another couple, we'll call them Jane and Tom. At first we didnt notice anything awry, but their relationship soon showed its true colors in a nasty way. Jane seems subdued and as if she's walking on eggshells around Tom, but has a completely different and more vibrant personality when she's on her own. Tom more and more has been berating Jane for the tiniest things in front of us and our other friends, sometimes embarrassing Jane to the point of tears. 

He claps at her to get her attention like an animal, and talks down to her constantly. Recently she had their first child, and things have definitely escalated with the stress of/control issues surrounding  their new baby. Sometimes we say something to refute what he's saying if he says something such as ""Jane, you're a bad mother"", we might respond ""Jane, I think youre doing a great job"".

However, Jane has confided in private that she'd prefer if we didnt say anything as it would only make it worse for her. She says she knows he was this way when she decided to marry him and she will put up with it. This is so worrying to me as, especially during the lockdown, who knows what she is having to put up with if he hasn't been able to hold it together just for the few times we've seen them in the past 6 months. 

Their child is certainly already being affected by the yelling and vitriol of their parent's relationship... she rarely sleeps, is colicky and seems ill at ease compared with other children the same age. It could be a coincidence for the time being, or a projection on my part, but there's no way this poor girl will remain unharmed.

Recently Tom started talking about how he throws and breaks things and has outbursts of rage frequently at home directed at Jane. And a couple weeks ago he got out of his car to threaten another driver in a fit of road rage. Obviously this escalation is extremely concerning for Jane, so I am going to speak to her safely away from Tom on Monday. My question is what things should I say and how should I approach this extremely sensitive topic? and is there anything I can do for her without reporting this to the police? (there are no womens or social work groups locally)  Thank you for any help.",domesticviolence
I don’t know what to do with him anymore. What should I do?,"I’ve posted on here maybe once or twice, I’m not sure. I’ve still been trying to keep track of everything he has done but haven’t been the best at it. 
A couple days ago my friends, myself and boyfriend went out of town together in our new car. While there, he decided to go visit his SICK brother who lives 1-2 hours away. He left without letting anyone know and when we would ask where he was he would say he was at the store. We all believed him because no one had eaten all day except for himself. Fast forward, because of the current situation we told him as a group we decided he should stay at his brothers since he could potentially have corona. He went ballistic and decided to come pick up his things in order to drive all the way back home. Even though we all (in exception for our friend who already lived in the area) came together in the new car. Through the phone he called me names and a friend who kind of knew about how he treats me hung up.
After a while after he came to pick up his things and yell at me from the balcony for the second time, I might add, I called him to make sure his drive was going smoothly. I told him he hurt our friends feelings after deciding to leave and continuously lie to them. He lost it. No lie. He started screaming at the top of his lungs, “YOURE A SNAKE! YOURE A SNAKE! I KNOW HOW YOU WORK. YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO HELP ME FIX THINGS, YOU COULDVE STOPPED THIS FROM HAPPENING. I HURTY OUR FRIENDS? LET ME RAM THIS CAR INTO A WALL AND THEN I CAN REALLY HURT THEIR FEELINGS. TELL ME AGAIN I HURT THEIR FEELINGS. TELL ME AGAIN. IM THE VICTIM NOT  YOU. ITS ME. ITS ALWAYS BEEN ME.” I started crying repeating no and no begging him to calm down. And then he hung up. 
A couple days ago he got mad at me because I started crying and decided to drive our car at 100 mph weaving through traffic. He then said “I wonder what would happen if I rammed this car into that bridge over there. What do you think babe?” I had to snap out of it and talk to him about my day in order to pretend everything was fine. 
After talking with our friends, we came to the conclusion he has either DID or schizo since he hears voices all the time which tell him to “get rid of her (me).” He has even chocked me during intimacy. I’m in constant fear he will either hurt me or himself. 
In my position what would y’all do? Where can I get help for him before this gets worse? Is there someone I can call that will force him to get the help he needs?",domesticviolence
Scars from the past,"I was in a relationship with a man for 5 years. He is an alcoholic, and while he wasn't physically and sexually abusive until the very end of the relationship back in August, he was often emotionally and psychologically abusive.

Yesterday it rained where I was. The weather was quite weird for where we are and the sky was a dark cloudy grey. The weather reminded me of this trip that we took to Alaska together. By all means it should have been a great trip. We went with my best friend from college and we got to see the northern lights.

However, there was a night that we left my friends behind and it was just me and him going in search of the northern lights. He got incredibly drunk, as per usual. He was driving us back to the hotel in our rental car and he was swerving a bit on this empty country road. I asked him to please pull over because I was scared and instead of pulling over, he drove faster and started swerving on purpose. I started screaming and threatened to jump out of the moving car. I even opened the door and was ready to jump until he pulled over. I ran outside and sat in the snow and refused to come back in. Dying from hypothermia was preferable to dying in a drunken crash.

I was driving when this memory hit me and I started panicking a bit. It felt so real, like I was there again.

I got to my current boyfriend's place and told him all about it and how scared I was. My current boyfriend is an angel and accepts me even though I have all these problems. My current boyfriend told me last night that he loved me, but I couldn't say it back. How can he be so sure already??? All I could think of was how broken I am and how I'm still thinking about my ex. I'm worried that I still love my ex even though everyone around me agrees that there was abuse.",domesticviolence
I think im being abused and I just need to tell someone,"I don't even know where to start. I have a history of being sexually assaulted, depression and suicidal thoughts and attempts. My (24f) husband (26m) and I have been together 5 years, got engaged and had 2 children. We were married in march. He's always been extremely jealous and controlling, but I felt pressure to stay work things out (yeah I know stupid me). 

This year things have gotten so much worse. Im a stay at home mom, I never leave the house because he either doesn't want to watch the kids or doesn't think its fair because he doesn't have any friends. I try to encourage him to make plans with someone but he wont. He always tells me how much he hates my friends because they drink and he doesn't want me to drink too. I've gone to a bar twice in the last 3 years and I hardly ever drink at home. 

We tried marriage counseling, and the counselor suggested I get a job because I'm depressed, exhausted and desperately need to interact with adults. I'm so lonely. Then covid-19 hit and there went my job searching. Im looking for one now but every one I mention to him he shits on and says I should just stay home. ""You would just get hit on anyways"" is what he says. Ridiculous.  

I had been on zoloft to treat my depression, but it caused me to lower my sex drive. That, coupled with the stress of raising 2 babies who REFUSED to sleep, you can imagine that part of our life stopped completely. He made get off completely. I didn't want to because it my life tolerable. I became depressed again and STILL didn't want sex. Over the weeks, maybe months, he coerced me into sex so many times after I clearly said no over and over. He even touched/penetrated me in my sleep. I have no idea how many times, I've only woken up to it twice. He let me drink one night, and he got drunk too. I was too drunk to do anything and he took advantage, even hit multiple times and had bruises the next day. 

Fast forward to this month, I had started seeing a counselor, to help me through my depression and stress. I told her how exhausted I was, and suggested I need to get out of the house at least 4-6 hours a week. I talked to my husband about what she said, and he immediately attacked me. ""well what about me? You are just gonna go out and drink and find someone else"" I told him no, I was planning on going out and joining a protest with my sister, Id forgotten how passionate I am my community and being involved. He lets me go. But not without a fight. ""Why are you putting makeup on? You never do that for me!"" Yes I do. ""Why are you brushing your teeth, plan on kissing someone?"" Apparently hygiene equals cheating. It goes on until I leave. I come back and he digs through my pockets and finds my lipgloss. ""What do you need this for? It's flavored!"" It's the only lip gloss I own. ""Are you seriously saying I'm cheating because I wore lipgloss?"" He responded ""if the shoe fits!"" 

Today I was going through my Google drive and found old pics of me and my friend when she was modeling that I had pretty much forgotten about. They are from 4 years ago, some are ""promiscuous"" as in they show my butt (kinda). I'm going through them and thought he would get a laugh at how dumb and terrible they were. He flips a switch and immediately starts attacking me accusing me of hiding them from him because ""you knew I would never approve of you doing THAT!"" But back then I did show them to him, they were horrible and I only saved like 3 of them. He knew about the photoshoot. I never hid anything from him. ""You did hide them from me, and makes me wonder what else you're hiding!"" I couldn't take the accusations anymore, I said im going to my moms to drop off my sister (she witnessed everything and has seen/heard much more in past arguments). I go upstairs to put on a bra and he follows me. ""What do you need a bra for? What are you really going to?"" Why am I not allowed to wear a bra now? What the fuck? 

There's hundreds of incidents like this, the fights last for hours, sometimes days. I feel like im leaving so much out, but I cant make this post too long.

In the car with my sister, she tells me I need to get out NOW. That what he's doing is abusive but it hasn't really occurred to me. I've always felt scared around him and she explained that's his way of controlling me and now it all makes sense. I feel so stupid and hurt",domesticviolence
I need advice,"I(17F) have dealt with abusers my whole life and written about it multiple times. But this post, surprisingly isn't about me. I live in a flat, in a relatively nice neighbourhood and my neighbours are mostly fine. In september, a man who is a heroin addict moved into an appartment next to mine. We didn't have any problems with him and he didn't bother anyone. A week ago, i was home alone when i heard the door bell ring 3 times frantically. I rushed to open the door and saw an unknown woman obviously high on drugs, breathing heavily, crying and clutching her stomach. The addict was going towards her and i immediately closed the door. I was scared shitless. I didn't quite know what happened and i tried to process it but couldn't. And then yesterday, while my mom was home with me, we heard screams and cries and bangs so loud i jumped from my chair. We looked through the peep hole and i saw the same woman with the addict guy. She was running up and down the stairs, again obviously high, screaming that he was hitting her and that he took her phone so she couldn't call the police. She was ringing neighbours doorbells but no one opened because we were all so frightened. My mom said she was afraid one of them will end up dead. That lasted for over an hour. In the end she went back to the apartment with him. I felt so bad for not helping her, but i know they are both addicts and i was afraid one of them would hurt me or my mom. What should i do the next time something like this happens? I'm also afraid to call the police because they would probably arrest them both because of drugs, and that i would do more harm to her than good.",domesticviolence
So I kinda need advice (I also posted this on another subreddit),"So my mom started “kinda” abusing me a while ago here’s why I say kinda
So she first started by standing on me when she thought I was pregnant even though I was just twelve back then (a few months ago) and I had no boyfriend and it was just and irregular period (she didn’t even let me take the test) 
But then after wards she started doing stuff like trying to stab me with scissors, chasing me trough the house with knives, threatening to kill me, forcing me to take 3 strips of birth control....cause she thought I was pregnant and we are already involved with cps (they don’t know about this) and she doesn’t want my brothers (and apparently me) to get taken away from her.. 
she was also diagnosed with psychosis a few years ago.. so she kinda has this weird story that’s she keeps on saying, that’s kinda like she thinks people can read her mind , if she sees anything on internet she pretends it’s aimed directly at her and says people are bullying her (it doesn’t even have to be bad) so once I heard yelling from downstairs and then she came to my door mad and kept on telling me to open it I was scared so I kept on saying stuff to stall like “why?” “I don’t want to if ur gonna hurt me...” she ended up kicking the door open and strangling me...
She’s hit me with a broom/mop stick before 
A piece of wood (it broke, but she used the excuse that it was already breaking even though I’m sure it wasn’t) etc.
But it’s like sometimes she’s like that and other times she’s acting as if she loves me...
Like around two weeks ago is the last time she hurt me, my school changed the transportation for school and said that someone would drive the students that live far away (including me) but then changed it again and said that wasn’t gonna happen she got mad and started blaming me for it and went into my room yelling for me to call my homeroom teacher I was looking at her cuz other wise she’d probably find it disrespectful but at the same time hoping that she didn’t think I was rolling my eyes cuz she often says that I’m rolling my eyes at her when all I’m doing is just looking at her this time was no different she thought I was rolling my eyes and hit me with a plate she aimed for my head but I blocked it with my arm I got a bruise but it wasn’t that visible and I got a wound (kinda looking like a dot of blood but at the same time it wasn’t bleeding) she continued yelling at me.... 
but now around two weeks later she hasn’t hit me since then (she has insulted me once again for things I couldn’t possibly control) but today she apologized after asking why I wasn’t that close with her and seemed to be “unhappy with her” so I mentioned the fact that she strangled me and she blamed it on me said it was my fault cuz I did (once again something I couldn’t possibly control) anyway later she came to my room and just said she wanted to make up with me.. so she said just sorry and kept on talking my door was closed but she kept asking for me to open it.. eventually I got kinda tired of hearing the same thing over and over again so I opened my door cuz I knew she probably wasn’t gonna go away.. she kinda hugged me all happy like a little child when she said something like yay or yes she forgives me or something like that.. but idk she could start hurting me at anytime again.. also even if she doesn’t am I supposed to just let it go as if it never happened in the first place I feel like I’m being over dramatic for not just letting it go.. and even though she did all that a lot I barely got any bruises so was it really that bad? Also would anyone even believe me if I tell them with zero evidence... it’s not like I have nightmares or something.. sometimes I do think she’s gonna hit me again and I flinch but that’s really all....... 

(TL;DR: so my mom with psychosis started “disciplining”(for stuff I couldn’t control) (and threatening to kill me) me a while ago but the last time she did it was a few weeks ago and she apologized today, she could do it anytime again but could also not.. do idk what to do...btw I’m a 13 girl with two brothers..and my dad lives in another city he’s coming to visit tomorrow tho..(before This she acted abusive towards my stepdad (who would never hurt her btw) but he committed... a few years ago also I don’t live in the US so the rules might be a bit different here)",domesticviolence

Can't do it alone,,domesticviolence
Do I even have the right to be mad? (Mental health issues as an explanation for abusive behavior),"This is going to be a really long one, but if anyone can stick with it, I’d really appreciate it. 

(Some background information: I’m transgender female-to-male and had been struggling a long time with my sexuality)

I dated a guy (we’ll call him Michael) for 11 months. I knew going into the relationship that he identified as asexual and I was fine with that. A little while into the relationship, Michael told me that he was a survivor of sexual assault and had PTSD. He told me his triggers, and I made sure to avoid them at all costs. A few months into the relationship, Michael expressed that he was interested in trying sexual things with me. We went slow — I made sure I never pressured him to do anything he didn’t want to, I avoided his triggers, and frequently checked to see if everything was alright. Everything was going fine — sometimes he’d get upset or overwhelmed, but we’d stop immediately and I’d always be there to comfort him. Eventually he got a lot more comfortable with sex so it happened more often. Then the end of the semester came (we’re both in college), and he began getting really stressed. 

He was in crisis just about every day. I tried to be there for him whenever he was upset, but it was becoming extremely taxing on me and my own mental health. It got to the point that I couldn’t take it anymore, so I told him I was feeling extremely emotionally worn out and asked him to find someone else to talk to about his issues. He apologized, but he didn’t stop. In fact, it got worse. The smallest thing could send him into deep self loathing to the point that I was extremely afraid of saying anything that might set him off. He had hurt himself in front of me before, so I was always afraid of what he might do if I spoke up about how basically being his therapist was affecting me.

Needless to say, I was more than relieved when summer cam around and I could go back to my home all the way across the country. Over the summer, I finally started passing as male. I also started to realize that I didn’t feel comfortable with the romantic side of my relationship with Michael and came out to him as aromantic. He agreed to stop doing very overtly romantic things in order to make me more comfortable. However, he didn’t stop — he kept doing things that I was uncomfortable with, becoming inconsolable when I’d confront him, and telling me that it was his depression/PTSD that was making it hard for him to remember. I figured that I couldn’t be angry with him since it was his mental illness and was beyond his control, so I just sucked it up and didn’t say anything about it again. 

Summer ended and I went back to school for the fall. A month or two later, I realized I was also very uncomfortable with the sexual side of our relationship as well and ended up I coming out to him as asexual. We agreed that we’d have more of a dedicated partnership than a romantic relationship and that we wouldn’t do anything else sexual because I told him I was extremely uncomfortable with it. 

But again, even though he was a sexual assault survivor who was always pushing consent, he didn’t stop sexual advances. It would start gradually enough that I wouldn’t realize until it was too late (for example, we’d be laying down with each other in bed and suddenly I’d realize his hands were where I didn’t want them to be). At this point, I wanted to say no, but then I’d remember how he had banged his head against the wall as self-punishment and thought he didn’t deserve to live for forgetting to turn on the fan above the stove — what would he do if I told him he had done something sexual to me without his consent? Or implied that he had done the same thing that the person who assaulted him did? He had told me from the beginning of the relationship that that was his greatest fear. 

So, afraid of what he might do to himself if I spoke up, I just let it happen. I’d even comfort him afterwards when he’d get upset and tell me that he hadn’t even wanted to do it. It made absolutely no sense to me since I had asked for us to stop doing sexual things for an indefinite amount of time and now here I was, having to comfort him after he had gone ahead with sex anyways and then claimed he never wanted to do it in the first place. This happened a few times, and I blamed myself for having somehow probably pressured him — why else would he have done it? He was asexual after all, right? Anyways, I ended up breaking up with him after winter break when I realized that I wasn’t aromantic or asexual, I just liked women instead of men (at one point in my life liking women was considered gay since I was living as a girl, so bad reactions from others had pushed me to believe I was bisexual). 

I blocked Michael on every social media platform I could think of, but ended up confronting him through tumblr messaging, telling him what he had done to me and the damage it had caused. He replied by saying “I was trapped in my worst memories, and it made it hard to remember where I was, who I was with, what was talked about”. 

Now I’m trying to figure out how much he can really be held accountable for what he did. On one hand, he created an environment where saying no could be dangerous and he also initiated sex after I had withdrawn consent indefinitely. On the other hand, he had severe mental health issues. I’m struggling to figure out if I’m allowed to put the blame on him and how much his mental health issues made it so that it really wasn’t his fault. 

So basically, is he still to blame even if his mental health issues made him forget all those things? Or is it even possible that depression, PTSD, or OCD can make you forget things like that? (For context, he was still able to do fine in classes and didn’t seem extremely mentally impaired)",domesticviolence

A Letter To My Abusive Ex.,"An Open Letter To My Abusive Ex.

There was at time I felt safe with you by my side, there weren't many but this one I will carry always. See, people ask me why did you stay with him through all of that. That isn't an easy thing to explain to those who've never experienced violence and gas-lighting to the extent of diminishment of self. 
I guess I held onto that moment for deeper than I should have, perhaps because it was the only glisten of humanity I saw, even though it was for yourself. 
I was in labour with our son, far earlier than what doctors decide is viable life. We were in the hospital watching the clock, timing. You were there by my side. You were holding me telling me everything was going to be okay. You were my rock when I needed it the most. I know now that you didn't do it for me. That was an act for you and your observers because we both know that in their notes, your actions were the reason we were there.

When I look back, it is so blatantly clear. You were the hunter, I was your prey.

You used my fears and my secrets I confided to you, to chip away at my self, to wear me down and groom me into a drudge you controlled.

At every glisten of me you would suppress, with your words, your hands, and your prick. Every action, every utterance you did, stripped another layer from my spirit, what it was to be me, to live.

I couldn't see it then, I believed your lies that something must be wrong with me, though I see it now. Through your demons you battered me until who I was, was gone.

You had this power of forging me into believing everything you said, that I deserved it, that I was stupid, that I was worthless if not for that act you used against me, that I was fucked in the head.

You stripped me, in all ways, back to my bones. I had become nothing other than a shell and your slave. Even then though it wasn't good enough, you had taken away my family, my friends, marked my sanity and deprived my dignity. You still wanted more, so that Wednesday in May, you took my light too.

I was resigned. I had succumbed to your whim, this was all I am for the rest of my life until you decide my body was expendable too. I mattered no more and just waited for my death at your hands. When that didn't come (yet), you lost the control. I got out.

No longer could your words, or your fists or that grip on my wrist make me do what you wanted.

You couldn't bear people knowing all that you had done, how dare I tell. So you took that fear you induced, you took that pain you caused, you took my secrets I shared and tried to spread them in shame. You told the world trauma you inflicted on me was made up in my mind, you fought against onus and still do to this day, in your words by your postings ""I will win"".

Oh but honey, this isn't a game.

I know that in reading this, if you are ever compelled to, it probably turns you on. A small list of your achievements, you won't read this as ever having done anything wrong.
Though this isn't that. I'm not asking for recognition nor is it a gift of forgiveness, no. You don't deserve a place of peace in my heart and I don't care to give it because I am not afraid, I've already lived in hell.

I want you to know that in fact, in some way, I am grateful. See, without being completely broken I wouldn't have been able to build up. I couldn't have breathed without feeling safe, I couldn't have smiled without feeling happiness deep, I couldn't have felt without knowing strength. If not for all the torture you forced me through, I couldn't have become who I am today, proud, strong, brave and unashamed.

I did that.

You are nothing without triumph of my defeat. I am everything you don't want in me, and everything you wish people thought you could be.

I stand tall through the trauma, and the venom you spit. I'm unwavering in your last battle to make me quit because thanks to you, I have nothing to fear.
You have a lifetime of self vindicating, a lifetime of justifying incidences you won't admit but I, I have light and I have power, I own my shit. 

Its not my shame, it's yours.",domesticviolence
Family members try to fight me because I don’t let them control me.,So I’ve been the bread winner of my family for like 5 years I’m a 25 year old female who lives with my mom sister and my boyfriend. I don’t bother anyone I pretty much stay in my room and go to work. I only moved my boyfriend in to help me with bills since my mom and sister doesn’t want to get a job. They have a problem with anything me and my boyfriend do for example they have issues with what we spend our money on and places we go another example is if anything comes up missing they blame it on my boyfriend then find the items and never apologize. I never make big deals about It I just move on from it. Just recently I was on the phone talking to my friend and my sister comes banging at my door asking me why I’m talking about her which I wasn’t but even if I was how dare you break my door down and try to fight me over something your not sure is really going on. I’m very laid back I try to laugh everyday and be happy and people hate seeing that so they try to do anything to get me down. They only try to bother me when my boyfriend is at work which is funny. I feel like their jealous and bored with their lives so they want to bother me because they know I don’t like confrontation. I feel like they project all their insecurities onto me. I’m trying to save and move out but it’s hard.,domesticviolence
I’m really just talking about my problems here cause I have no one else to talk to..,"So I posted something in the night a few hours ago at like 1 am or something I’ve already deleted it by now but... it was just me explaining what my mom did.. and people were saying that it’s abuse if you haven’t seen the post (wich most likely you haven’t) I’m a 13 year old girl and I live with my mom and my older and younger brother.. my mom got diagnosed with psychosis a few years ago after we got involved with CPS they never really told us but I hear them talking about it and I found some medication that used used to treat that...(I was searching for something and came across it and googled it cuz I was curious) and also my mom has a certain way of saying that they diagnosed her.. so recently a few months ago she started (I’m so uncomfortable with the word) abusing me... the last time she hit me was two weeks ago with a plate long story short she said that I was rolling my eyes at her (I don’t know why but she always thinks that almost anytime I just look at her) yesterday... she was asking why I seemed “distant” or seemed like I didn’t really like her... so I mentioned something that happend a while ago where she strangled me.. at first she blamed it on me and said it was my fault for (something I didn’t do but she thought I did) then I went to my room and later she came and apologized... she kept on asking me to open my door eventually I did and she just hugged me and thought I forgave her I just went along with it my brothers seem to not be too bothered by any of it (they even made fun of me a few times when she hurt me) it’s like sometimes she’s just my mom and other times she hates me...

Some people in the replies kinda warned me that she’d probably do it again.. today I got scared and thought she would so this morning she got really mad because she found my older brothers keys outside and they’ve been there since yesterday she got really upset and said that anyone could’ve entered our house she started yelling at my brother who also got really mad and said that he wasn’t the one that left the keys there she said that they were his keys and he was responsible for it and he quickly tried to blame me for leaving the keys outside but I have my own keys and didn’t use his and he knows that but still started hitting and kicking my door trying to open it and threatening me all because he was tryna but my moms attention and the blame on me so he wouldn’t be yelled at or blamed for it then my mom came upstairs and he went to his room upset and then my mom started hitting and kicking my door (and blaming me for stuff that didn’t happen and I couldn’t control that also had nothing to do with the situation) I got scared because it reminded me of all the times she did that wich always led to her hurting me eventually she kicked it open like she always does she was upset but didn’t hurt me (luckily) but I could’ve made one wrong move and she would’ve... in that moment I did really wish I told someone because I got really scared but after wards I couldn’t imagine telling anyone...(i know it isn’t but it just really feels embarrassing)


so I didn’t really know what to do people in the replies from last night told me to tell someone.. but I don’t really know who I’m gonna tell... some people said my teacher but my mom chose to make me stay home because of the virus so I don’t go to school... and telling them online just seems awkward and I can’t even imagine how they’d react.
Then some people said to tell my dad.. but he only comes and visits sometimes and sometimes I text him but he doesn’t read the messages cuz he didn’t get them he was supposed to visit today but didn’t show up..(butmy mom and him are calling and playing a game with my little brother rn while my older brother plays a games with his friend) 
And then some people said tell you’re social worker well... I’ve really seen multiple people and honestly those are all people from CPS or they work close to them and I always tell them everything’s fine so telling any of them is just..embarrassing or awkward for me I don’t know how to talk to people well.. I’m always worried what they think of me.. also even though I’ve seen them a couple of times over the years it almost feels like they’re strangers.. and whenever I see them my moms there... and I have literally no evidence at all to show that what I’m saying is true I have like one bruise that’s almost completely gone and you can barely see so now I’m worried about who to tell.. how to tell them.. whether they’re gonna believe me or not..and how they’re gonna react and what they’re gonna do if I tell them.....and also people have it worse than me... the last time she hurt me was a while ago would it really count......
I know everything I said probably sounds irrational like why don’t I just tell someone why am I being like this... 
Okay so that was it for me ranting about my problems....

Living with an abusive alcoholic father.,"Hi, so this is my first Reddit account so apologies if I format things wrong or anything along those lines I just need somewhere to vent where it's completely anonymous.

I'm a just turned 18 year old male living in the UK and living with an abusive father and I honestly just don't know what to do and feel like I need to vent. My father's Ex-Navy and has been an alcoholic for as long as I can remember.

 I'm living here at the moment because it's easier for me to get to and from college and it's a quiet place to get my coursework done but I literally don't think I can handle living here anymore. He's drinking up 3+ bottles of wine a day every single day during this lockdown and is gradually getting worse. He's physically violent to me at times to the point where he's scarred/cut me on multiple occasions, he's beat me, said homophobic things to me, gaslit me.  

I don't know whether to stick it out for the next year until I can get into a university far away from here or find somewhere else to stay. I'm just so confused and scared.",domesticviolence

Living with abusive father on isolated farm.,"Hi so this is my very first post here, the reason I decided to reach out is that im scared to death.
Some background: my mother passed , from breast cancer when I was 6, my father remarried  immediately, my step mom, father and step grandmother would physically abuse me on a regular basis. Eventually my father also started abusing my step mom, he nearly killed her twice. This continued till I was 16 and they separated. I was shipped off to boarding school, happiest two years of my life. After school got over, I joined college in a neighbouring city, things have been fine the last three years when I lived by myself. Now due to the coronavirus pandemic I'm forced to live with my father in an isolated farm, he has started abusing me again on a daily basis. Threatened to kill me on multiple occasions. I'm scared and don't know what to do. He's far too powerful for me to complain to the police, he absolutely faced no consequences for landing his wife in the hospital. I have no way out right now, I'm a student with no resources and can't just leave home. I'm from India, so me on the streets wouldn't be the best idea. Thank you so much for taking the time to read, more than anything I needed to get this off my chest.

Abusive ex won't stop harassing me even with a restraining order.,"4 months ago I went to the police to press charges and get a restraining order. My ex narc was silent the entire time up until last week. I guess he was waiting for things to ""die down"" before he makes an INDIRECT appearance? 

A week ago, I received texts from Amazon but my number isn't associated with my account. 

Yesterday, I received 40+ international calls. This is not no damn coincidence. This guy is annoying as hell. I'm changing my number but should I tell the police? I suspect he posted my number somewhere and these mfs won't stop calling. They call every 5 minutes! 

Can somebody tell me what my next steps are?! I have no evidence that it's him. &amp; I think that's why he's doing it this way so he doesn't violate the restraining order.

Why is he harassing me?! What does he want from me?! Is he gonna directly contact me next?! I'm so confused.",domesticviolence

My (20F) stepdad (39M) threatened to kill my mother (36F) during an argument.,"A little long, TLDR at the bottom. This is my first time posting in this sub, the mods from r/relationships sent me to you guys. Please forgive any irregularities. 

I recently moved back in with my parents. They fight. A lot. Nasty, screaming-match fights that can last for days. They had a child last year which has naturally created new tensions in the house, mostly because my stepfather contributes substantially less to childcare than my mother. It's obvious he loves the baby, but he often leaves my mother to do 70–90% of the grunt work (e.g. napping while she's in tears from back pain and needs help with the baby, spending hours at the gym/not adjusting any part of his pre-baby schedule, etc.) They are both currently unemployed and basically in the house together 24/7. To be honest it's clear that he's not equally contributing and it's grinding her down, but they don't communicate well at all and the whole situation is generating a lot of resentment. He is currently doing CBT therapy for anger management, which was a stipulation of an ultimatum my mother apparently gave him to avoid divorce. Couples therapy is not currently an option for insurance reasons.

A few months ago he purchased a rifle for home defense. I believe it's an AR-15. It is not in a safe. It stays beside their bed in the case it was purchased in. The other week, they got into an argument that ended with my stepdad storming out of the house. My mom broke down in front of me and admitted that he recently said to her ""I should shoot you in the fucking head"" while they were having a fight. Guys, I don't have the words to describe what hearing that felt like. It was a sickening, primal fear. My face must have given me away because she instantly regretted telling me, and spent the next half hour reassuring me that she felt completely safe and knew for a fact that he would never harm her. But what mother wouldn't?

My stepdad has never struck me as the violent type. He's a bit more confrontational than my mother and I, but I've always attributed that to his hailing from a more urban, crowded part of the country than us. I have always felt completely and totally safe around him. He has been in my life since I was a teenager, and I've come to view him as my true father, which only makes this worse. I feel guilty for the fears that I'm having. He has done so much for me, and has supported me in so many ways, and here I am, scared that he might harm my mom or my sibling or all of us. I will say that he is ex-military (non-combat) and ex-NFL, and we have suspected for some time that he may suffer from CTE.

I am physically ill with paranoia. They have been screaming most of the day, and with every lull in the argument I'm terrified that I will hear gunshots. I know this is very macabre, and it might just be my anxiety rearing its ugly head, but my quality of life has dropped significantly since this began. I don't have a big biological family. My mother and sibling are all I have, and if something were to happen to them, my life would be over. I just don't know what to do. My mom is financially dependent on him, and she does not have a degree. If I were to do anything that would remove either of them from this house, she and the baby (and myself) would be homeless and without any money. And although I feel horribly selfish even thinking about my own situation, this is really taxing me emotionally. I'm trying to get through college while also working part-time, and now I have this nightmarish anxiety always waiting for me at home. On top of that, I'm often left to care for the baby in a separate room while they fight. I can't do it all. It's eating me up.

My longterm boyfriend (24M) who, admittedly, is much more level-headed and much less anxious than I am, is trying to reassure me that my stepdad wouldn't hurt my mother. He thinks it was purely a heat of the moment anger that spilled out, and perhaps a result of my stepdad's military/police training. And really, I have never once felt unsafe around my stepfather until this happened. But I'm trying to look at the facts here, which are:

* There is a gun in the house that is in plain sight at all times, not in a safe.
* They are having bitter, drawn out fights every other week or so, often within the same space as the weapon.
* They are constantly in close proximity with little reprieve from one another.
* He has impulsively threatened to shoot her.
* It is possible that he has suffered brain injuries that can impact decision-making.
* Also a fact is that the best predictor of future behavior is past behavior, and my stepdad has never laid a hand on my mother (that I know of.)

What do I do? What *can* I do? What *should* I do? Am I overreacting? Any advice will be appreciated so much. 

TLDR; My stepdad threatened to shoot my mother in the head during a recent argument. He owns a gun which he doesn't keep locked up. They are having intense arguments several times a month, primarily surrounding tensions caused by my new baby sibling. He has never hurt me or my mother, and is by all accounts a kind person, but the paranoia is wearing me down. Neither my mother nor myself are in a position to leave the house, and I don't even know if that's something that should be considered. I am juggling school, work, the fear of my mother being harmed, and the responsibility of caring for my sibling while they fight. I am overwhelmed, scared, and confused. I need some guidance.",domesticviolence
My boyfriend raped me. I want to understand why.,"CROSS POSTED, throw away account 

Last night my boyfriend and father of my child raped me. It was my birthday. My first night out, baby with a sitter, for the first time in over a year. I got intoxicated and a took one single hit of weed. I was unable to walk, I had slurred speech, confusion, and I think I periodically passed out. My boyfriend was pretty much sober, however. 
He brought me to bed and I was laying on my back. At first I thought I was dreaming when I realized he wasn’t listening to me saying “no “ repeatedly. I used my arms to try and push him away. I said I don’t want this, I don’t know who you are, and even cried “rape” over and over. Nothing stopped him. I couldn’t believe he could be capable of this. I remember crying “no, not YOU! Not you not you!” Because I never imagined he was capable of this... 
This morning I woke up and sat up in disbelief. I wanted to believe it was a nightmare. But he woke up to. He seemed irritated and asked if I remember last night. I said I had a bad dream. He said it was real, that I kept crying rape, saying no, that I don’t know him. So there’s no doubt in my mind that this all happened. But I’m shocked that he so readily confessed to it like he doesn’t see a problem ?! He admits I was blacked out, didn’t want sex, cried rape, but he chose to continue anyway. I feel numb, scared, and confused. Just, why? Why would he do this? I feel betrayed, violated, and lost.",domesticviolence
boyfriend slapped me for the first time and claims he doesn't remember,"Ok guys this might be a long post, but I'm in a bad situation. I need advice and your opinions/ and any personal experience you might have relating to my situation. I've {female 21 yr} been dating my boyfriend {male 20yrs} for about 2 years, its been up and down definitely toxic at times, but recently as we've both been going to therapy and getting help we have been better than ever. Some background on my boyfriend, his father is very abusive and has been his whole life, he still lives with his parents &amp; his environment at home is usually very toxic. Yesterday I was over at his parents house and we were watching a show in his room, his younger sister {shes 9 years old} came and watched it with us, my boyfriend fell asleep quickly so I let him be and am just enjoying the show with his little sister. As time passes its about 8pm, I decide to wake him up because I know that he won't be able to fall asleep later that night if he keeps napping. Hes probably been asleep for about an hour and a half maybe more, so I gently wake him &amp; hes pretty grumpy and annoyed. I explain to him that I just wanted him to be able to fall asleep later and that it was getting late. He's still half asleep and I let him be for a few mins- i lovingly put my head on his and nudge him a few times (I can see how that would be annoying but its out of love) he then gets very angry and raises his voice telling me to cut it out. I tell him I have to go soon and want to hangout with him before I go and I nudge him again. He rolls over facing me and backhands me in the face, it was hard. Sometimes we play rough but this was uncalled for and it really hurt. When he slapped me obviously his sister heard it and she put her hand on my face and said hes a meanie, but maybe she thought we were just playing around. A few seconds passed by and my boyfriend didn't do or say anything, I was furious like blood boiling angry and hurt. So I get up and go to the restroom worried I would cry in front of his sister. After I get my stuff I say I'm going home, I did not want to be there as it was only past 8pm my boyfriend and his sister are surprised because I usually stay later. I walk out and head to my car. My boyfriend has the audacity to ask why I'm leaving and I'm dumbfounded. I even say are you fucking kidding me you slapped me in the face &amp; you did it in front of your little sister? He says he doesn't REMEMBER slapping me and that it was on accident and points out that nothing like this has ever happened before. I keep my distance and don't say much after he gives his speech saying he's sorry and bs he tries to tell me to come inside. HELL no he asks for a hug and I say no thanks and I get in my car and leave. He has never hit me before, although his slap was hard it didn't cause damage to my face, but I feel so disrespected and that its a huuuuge red flag. He keeps saying he loves me, that he's sorry and that it was an accident. Am I stupid to believe him? Because part of me wants to and then my rational side kicks in and smells the bullshit. Should I leave him? I may have low self-worth but something like this I will not stand for or forgive. They say once your partner hits you most likely they will again and I'm afraid that if I don't leave that it will. Tell me your thoughts please, as this happened yesterday I am still coming to terms with everything. Is this considered abuse? What do I do?",domesticviolence
PTSD is haunting my new relationship and I fear I’m destroying it. Advice?,"Brief back-story: My (F29) now ex-husband was incredibly abusive. Physically, mentally, emotionally and financially. He’s currently facing 20 years because he tried to kill me. This was just under a year ago (we separated over a year ago) and, while I have come to terms with what happened, the emotional and physical scars still exist. I have been formally diagnosed with ptsd - the effects of which I am still learning to recognize and cope with. 

After I moved to a new city, found a job, my own place, got a dog and became settled I met and became friends with a man through work. After his relationship ended we started dating (it’s been almost 3 months). We were close when we were friends and are even closer now. 

He treats me well, he is kind to me and others, he helps the local community and is hard-working. Even so, I find myself sabotaging our relationship because of my past. I am easily triggered and I find ways to ‘hate’ him. I nit-pick his actions trying to somehow uncover his eventual abuse in some kind of “ta-da, gotcha” type way. 

People always say “trust your gut” but I don’t know what that looks like any more. I’m always second guessing myself to the point that it feels like I’m gaslighting....myself. I don’t trust him when I am triggered nor do I trust myself. I feel like I’m going crazy. 

I name-call (he does not) and yell (he does not). It’s like I have become the abuser because I am so used to having to constantly be on the defense. I don’t want to be this way, feel this way or treat him this way. I don’t want to be the reason our relationship fails. 

He is incredibly supportive and has said he will work to build my trust and to understand my triggers. I feel like such a burden and so pathetic - my need to feel strong and how I try to achieve that is my weakness. 

I need advice, stories, experiences. I’m so inside my head that I don’t even feel like myself.",domesticviolence

Bystander who called the cops- Did I do the right thing?,"The couple who lives directly above me often argue. There are typically lots of thuds. They did not move in long ago, and I barely have met them. Tonight, it escalated to a new level as I heard screams and cries (both male and female) of “get off of me”, “get the fuck out”, “you’re attacking me”, “give it back to me”, and more. The female who lives in this apartment is a family member of the landlord. Another neighbor went upstairs to diffuse the situation, and it calmed down. A few minutes later, it escalated to sobs of the above phrases, so I called the police. 

I need reassurance that I did the right thing. I barely know this couple, and because the girl is a relative of the landlord (he was nowhere to be found- tried him first), I honestly hesitated at first. I believe she has substance abuse issues and has been in trouble before. I would hate to make anything worse. I didn’t know what else to do- God forbid something went tragically wrong, I could not just look the other way and have that on my conscience.",domesticviolence
Grandmother being Abused by son,"Hey,

first of all this is a throwaway for obvious reasons.

Since my Grandfather died
my Grandmother is being mentaly and physically abused by my uncle (her son).
She is currently staying at my house but wants to go back home because she misses home (I life about 1,5h away).
Her son has an apartment on his own but comes by her house regularly. He will threaten her and tell her shes worthless etc. And also hit her and push her around. Then wants my grandma to say sorry to him for making him angry.
My Grandmother defends him and says that he isn’t always like that. She just loves him too much to kick him out. 

Is there anyway I can help her ? I have been supporting her no matter what but she just seems to not recognise that shes being abused, since it has been increasing over time

I would be so grateful for anyone giving advice and feel free to ask questions on detail.",domesticviolence
What if?,"Throwaway acct. I’m in the middle of a shitshow with my soon to be ex husband who beat me back in late Nov. I didn’t file a police report initially or report him (he’s active mil), but did get treated and injuries documented at the ER the day after it happened. 

The situation has been strange, he’s taken on a pattern of being verbally/financially/emotionally abusive now. 

Days ago I filed the police report and gave them all supporting documentation/photos/evidence. Unfortunately the detectives in Victim Advocacy at the substation I went to have a 30 day processing period before it’s even considered for prosecution by the DA—IF it even gets that far, due to the length of time that’s passed (approx 6 months).

I also filed for divorce but due to COVID, it’s taking more time for petitions to be filed and served. I filed back in Dec, but put  it on hold because I was a dumbass and thought counseling would help. 

One thing I’m curious about. My husband has a child from a previous marriage and another from a relationship between marriages where it was “one shot one kill.” He has unofficial primary custody of the child from his first marriage (mom didn’t want to mom so they reversed their possession periods and she sent her to live w/us during the school year). Their divorce decree was never changed to reflect this. Just a notarized letter. 

The child between marriages—he had no relationship with him and wasn’t present for the birth or for the first few years (he’s 3 and I just found out my husband met him for the first time last weekend—must be guilt). 

With our youngest, shared child, I fully intend to go to blows with him over this as he’s mentioned he doesn’t care if he goes broke doing so, he’d fight me for primary custody. If it doesn’t work in his favor, will it surface that he’s got domestic abuser status and will the court (or whomever) notify the other mothers? I’m sorry if it’s a stupid question and if it’s been asked before. Thanks in advance.",domesticviolence
I left my abuser 2 months ago and just found out I have high risk HPV...,"I’m angry and emotional. I’m only 24, and I just had a baby 6 months ago. I got a pap done about three weeks and my OB called me yesterday to tell me it was abnormal and i have high risk HPV. I got the vaccine as a little girl. The only two people I’ve ever had unprotected sex with are my rapist and my abuser. And I don’t know who I got it from because I don’t remember when my last pap was before this one. I just want to cry. It wasn’t enough that he cheated on me, that he mentally emotionally abused me, that he strangled me. He had to just burn me some other way too. Why?",domesticviolence

Recently having more frequent bad dreams about abuser,It’s almost 3 am and I just woke up from a bad dream about my abusive ex. It’s been 12 years since I’ve seen him. My dreams aren’t about past abuse but just about him in general. Either he’s just there and that scares me or he’s abusing me in some way. These dreams have recently become more frequent. This last dream I escaped from a bathroom I was being held in and ran to a neighbor’s house. He found me and stabbed me with a broken off piece of wood. Then I woke up. I hate that after all this time I’m still terrified of him.,domesticviolence
He tried to force me to tell people I was lying.,"I was in a relationship for 5 years. I was 14 years old when we met, 15 when we started dating, 19 when we broke up, but 20 when things were officially over. The emotional abuse was present the entire time. He would get jealous of any and everybody I came in to contact with. This goes as deep as he got angry at me during my sisters graduation party because I hugged my older male cousin. I never had guy friends. My entire high school experience was spent providing for my boyfriend because his mother didn't give him much. I payed for everything, drove him everywhere, supported every single thing he did. The domestic abuse started when I was about 18. I don't know who hit first. But I do know that he did not hold back. Sometimes Id start the fight, sometimes he would, but I was always the one that left with bruises and scars. One day he hacked into my phone and deleted all the evidence I had against him. He had given me 2 black eyes, I had finger print bruises all over my arm, he broke my phone into shattered pieces in my dorm room, pushed me against the bed so hard my knee also has a scar. The only photo I have of the abuse is one of a tortilla sized bruise with a gash on my thigh that he gave me when he grabbed me so hard in a car then pushed me out of it in a gas station parking lot and abandoned me. That was the day we broke up. A year later (after much more emotional abuse in the time between) I decided to expose him to most of my friends for what he did to me. Apparently one of them said something to him and he made a lot of fake numbers to get in contact with me (I've since changed my number) but overall he did get in contact with me. He told me I was a liar and that I need to tell everyone the truth: Hes not an abuser and is a really sweet and nice guy. He made me feel horrible. He made me feel like I ruined his life for speaking about my experiences. He told me I'm disgusting and just a white girl who wants to ruin a black males life which I would NEVER do. I would NEVER lie about domestic violence and especially not use my privilege for people to believe me. This abuse ACTUALLY HAPPENED to me and caused major trauma. Am I wrong for telling people what happened to me? Am I a horrible person? He told me every time he hit me was a byproduct of my own actions... what did I do to deserve that when I was literally a mother figure in his life while also being a girlfriend in my TEEN years? I've never felt more free in my life than not having any contact with him at all.",domesticviolence

So yesterday I had bought myself a small bottle of E&amp;J Brandy, it was on my floor next to my feet.. is it normal/legal for him to look through my door (it was cracked open enough to where you can see outside my room. He comes home from his friends house and arches his back peeping in my room and says "" Nice bottle you got there"".

How do I approach a friend in an abusive relationship?,"My boyfriend and I are friends with another couple, we'll call them Jane and Tom. At first we didnt notice anything awry, but their relationship soon showed its true colors in a nasty way. Jane seems subdued and as if she's walking on eggshells around Tom, but has a completely different and more vibrant personality when she's on her own. Tom more and more has been berating Jane for the tiniest things in front of us and our other friends, sometimes embarrassing Jane to the point of tears. 

He claps at her to get her attention like an animal, and talks down to her constantly. Recently she had their first child, and things have definitely escalated with the stress of/control issues surrounding  their new baby. Sometimes we say something to refute what he's saying if he says something such as ""Jane, you're a bad mother"", we might respond ""Jane, I think youre doing a great job"".

However, Jane has confided in private that she'd prefer if we didnt say anything as it would only make it worse for her. She says she knows he was this way when she decided to marry him and she will put up with it. This is so worrying to me as, especially during the lockdown, who knows what she is having to put up with if he hasn't been able to hold it together just for the few times we've seen them in the past 6 months. 

Their child is certainly already being affected by the yelling and vitriol of their parent's relationship... she rarely sleeps, is colicky and seems ill at ease compared with other children the same age. It could be a coincidence for the time being, or a projection on my part, but there's no way this poor girl will remain unharmed.

Recently Tom started talking about how he throws and breaks things and has outbursts of rage frequently at home directed at Jane. And a couple weeks ago he got out of his car to threaten another driver in a fit of road rage. Obviously this escalation is extremely concerning for Jane, so I am going to speak to her safely away from Tom on Monday. My question is what things should I say and how should I approach this extremely sensitive topic? and is there anything I can do for her without reporting this to the police? (there are no womens or social work groups locally)  Thank you for any help.",domesticviolence
I don’t know what to do with him anymore. What should I do?,"I’ve posted on here maybe once or twice, I’m not sure. I’ve still been trying to keep track of everything he has done but haven’t been the best at it. 
A couple days ago my friends, myself and boyfriend went out of town together in our new car. While there, he decided to go visit his SICK brother who lives 1-2 hours away. He left without letting anyone know and when we would ask where he was he would say he was at the store. We all believed him because no one had eaten all day except for himself. Fast forward, because of the current situation we told him as a group we decided he should stay at his brothers since he could potentially have corona. He went ballistic and decided to come pick up his things in order to drive all the way back home. Even though we all (in exception for our friend who already lived in the area) came together in the new car. Through the phone he called me names and a friend who kind of knew about how he treats me hung up.
After a while after he came to pick up his things and yell at me from the balcony for the second time, I might add, I called him to make sure his drive was going smoothly. I told him he hurt our friends feelings after deciding to leave and continuously lie to them. He lost it. No lie. He started screaming at the top of his lungs, “YOURE A SNAKE! YOURE A SNAKE! I KNOW HOW YOU WORK. YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO HELP ME FIX THINGS, YOU COULDVE STOPPED THIS FROM HAPPENING. I HURTY OUR FRIENDS? LET ME RAM THIS CAR INTO A WALL AND THEN I CAN REALLY HURT THEIR FEELINGS. TELL ME AGAIN I HURT THEIR FEELINGS. TELL ME AGAIN. IM THE VICTIM NOT  YOU. ITS ME. ITS ALWAYS BEEN ME.” I started crying repeating no and no begging him to calm down. And then he hung up. 
A couple days ago he got mad at me because I started crying and decided to drive our car at 100 mph weaving through traffic. He then said “I wonder what would happen if I rammed this car into that bridge over there. What do you think babe?” I had to snap out of it and talk to him about my day in order to pretend everything was fine. 
After talking with our friends, we came to the conclusion he has either DID or schizo since he hears voices all the time which tell him to “get rid of her (me).” He has even chocked me during intimacy. I’m in constant fear he will either hurt me or himself. 
In my position what would y’all do? Where can I get help for him before this gets worse? Is there someone I can call that will force him to get the help he needs?",domesticviolence
Scars from the past,"I was in a relationship with a man for 5 years. He is an alcoholic, and while he wasn't physically and sexually abusive until the very end of the relationship back in August, he was often emotionally and psychologically abusive.

Yesterday it rained where I was. The weather was quite weird for where we are and the sky was a dark cloudy grey. The weather reminded me of this trip that we took to Alaska together. By all means it should have been a great trip. We went with my best friend from college and we got to see the northern lights.

However, there was a night that we left my friends behind and it was just me and him going in search of the northern lights. He got incredibly drunk, as per usual. He was driving us back to the hotel in our rental car and he was swerving a bit on this empty country road. I asked him to please pull over because I was scared and instead of pulling over, he drove faster and started swerving on purpose. I started screaming and threatened to jump out of the moving car. I even opened the door and was ready to jump until he pulled over. I ran outside and sat in the snow and refused to come back in. Dying from hypothermia was preferable to dying in a drunken crash.

I was driving when this memory hit me and I started panicking a bit. It felt so real, like I was there again.

I got to my current boyfriend's place and told him all about it and how scared I was. My current boyfriend is an angel and accepts me even though I have all these problems. My current boyfriend told me last night that he loved me, but I couldn't say it back. How can he be so sure already??? All I could think of was how broken I am and how I'm still thinking about my ex. I'm worried that I still love my ex even though everyone around me agrees that there was abuse.",domesticviolence
I think im being abused and I just need to tell someone,"I don't even know where to start. I have a history of being sexually assaulted, depression and suicidal thoughts and attempts. My (24f) husband (26m) and I have been together 5 years, got engaged and had 2 children. We were married in march. He's always been extremely jealous and controlling, but I felt pressure to stay work things out (yeah I know stupid me). 

This year things have gotten so much worse. Im a stay at home mom, I never leave the house because he either doesn't want to watch the kids or doesn't think its fair because he doesn't have any friends. I try to encourage him to make plans with someone but he wont. He always tells me how much he hates my friends because they drink and he doesn't want me to drink too. I've gone to a bar twice in the last 3 years and I hardly ever drink at home. 

We tried marriage counseling, and the counselor suggested I get a job because I'm depressed, exhausted and desperately need to interact with adults. I'm so lonely. Then covid-19 hit and there went my job searching. Im looking for one now but every one I mention to him he shits on and says I should just stay home. ""You would just get hit on anyways"" is what he says. Ridiculous.  

I had been on zoloft to treat my depression, but it caused me to lower my sex drive. That, coupled with the stress of raising 2 babies who REFUSED to sleep, you can imagine that part of our life stopped completely. He made get off completely. I didn't want to because it my life tolerable. I became depressed again and STILL didn't want sex. Over the weeks, maybe months, he coerced me into sex so many times after I clearly said no over and over. He even touched/penetrated me in my sleep. I have no idea how many times, I've only woken up to it twice. He let me drink one night, and he got drunk too. I was too drunk to do anything and he took advantage, even hit multiple times and had bruises the next day. 

Fast forward to this month, I had started seeing a counselor, to help me through my depression and stress. I told her how exhausted I was, and suggested I need to get out of the house at least 4-6 hours a week. I talked to my husband about what she said, and he immediately attacked me. ""well what about me? You are just gonna go out and drink and find someone else"" I told him no, I was planning on going out and joining a protest with my sister, Id forgotten how passionate I am my community and being involved. He lets me go. But not without a fight. ""Why are you putting makeup on? You never do that for me!"" Yes I do. ""Why are you brushing your teeth, plan on kissing someone?"" Apparently hygiene equals cheating. It goes on until I leave. I come back and he digs through my pockets and finds my lipgloss. ""What do you need this for? It's flavored!"" It's the only lip gloss I own. ""Are you seriously saying I'm cheating because I wore lipgloss?"" He responded ""if the shoe fits!"" 

Today I was going through my Google drive and found old pics of me and my friend when she was modeling that I had pretty much forgotten about. They are from 4 years ago, some are ""promiscuous"" as in they show my butt (kinda). I'm going through them and thought he would get a laugh at how dumb and terrible they were. He flips a switch and immediately starts attacking me accusing me of hiding them from him because ""you knew I would never approve of you doing THAT!"" But back then I did show them to him, they were horrible and I only saved like 3 of them. He knew about the photoshoot. I never hid anything from him. ""You did hide them from me, and makes me wonder what else you're hiding!"" I couldn't take the accusations anymore, I said im going to my moms to drop off my sister (she witnessed everything and has seen/heard much more in past arguments). I go upstairs to put on a bra and he follows me. ""What do you need a bra for? What are you really going to?"" Why am I not allowed to wear a bra now? What the fuck? 

There's hundreds of incidents like this, the fights last for hours, sometimes days. I feel like im leaving so much out, but I cant make this post too long.

In the car with my sister, she tells me I need to get out NOW. That what he's doing is abusive but it hasn't really occurred to me. I've always felt scared around him and she explained that's his way of controlling me and now it all makes sense. I feel so stupid and hurt",domesticviolence
I need advice,"I(17F) have dealt with abusers my whole life and written about it multiple times. But this post, surprisingly isn't about me. I live in a flat, in a relatively nice neighbourhood and my neighbours are mostly fine. In september, a man who is a heroin addict moved into an appartment next to mine. We didn't have any problems with him and he didn't bother anyone. A week ago, i was home alone when i heard the door bell ring 3 times frantically. I rushed to open the door and saw an unknown woman obviously high on drugs, breathing heavily, crying and clutching her stomach. The addict was going towards her and i immediately closed the door. I was scared shitless. I didn't quite know what happened and i tried to process it but couldn't. And then yesterday, while my mom was home with me, we heard screams and cries and bangs so loud i jumped from my chair. We looked through the peep hole and i saw the same woman with the addict guy. She was running up and down the stairs, again obviously high, screaming that he was hitting her and that he took her phone so she couldn't call the police. She was ringing neighbours doorbells but no one opened because we were all so frightened. My mom said she was afraid one of them will end up dead. That lasted for over an hour. In the end she went back to the apartment with him. I felt so bad for not helping her, but i know they are both addicts and i was afraid one of them would hurt me or my mom. What should i do the next time something like this happens? I'm also afraid to call the police because they would probably arrest them both because of drugs, and that i would do more harm to her than good.",domesticviolence
So I kinda need advice (I also posted this on another subreddit),"So my mom started “kinda” abusing me a while ago here’s why I say kinda
So she first started by standing on me when she thought I was pregnant even though I was just twelve back then (a few months ago) and I had no boyfriend and it was just and irregular period (she didn’t even let me take the test) 
But then after wards she started doing stuff like trying to stab me with scissors, chasing me trough the house with knives, threatening to kill me, forcing me to take 3 strips of birth control....cause she thought I was pregnant and we are already involved with cps (they don’t know about this) and she doesn’t want my brothers (and apparently me) to get taken away from her.. 
she was also diagnosed with psychosis a few years ago.. so she kinda has this weird story that’s she keeps on saying, that’s kinda like she thinks people can read her mind , if she sees anything on internet she pretends it’s aimed directly at her and says people are bullying her (it doesn’t even have to be bad) so once I heard yelling from downstairs and then she came to my door mad and kept on telling me to open it I was scared so I kept on saying stuff to stall like “why?” “I don’t want to if ur gonna hurt me...” she ended up kicking the door open and strangling me...
She’s hit me with a broom/mop stick before 
A piece of wood (it broke, but she used the excuse that it was already breaking even though I’m sure it wasn’t) etc.
But it’s like sometimes she’s like that and other times she’s acting as if she loves me...
Like around two weeks ago is the last time she hurt me, my school changed the transportation for school and said that someone would drive the students that live far away (including me) but then changed it again and said that wasn’t gonna happen she got mad and started blaming me for it and went into my room yelling for me to call my homeroom teacher I was looking at her cuz other wise she’d probably find it disrespectful but at the same time hoping that she didn’t think I was rolling my eyes cuz she often says that I’m rolling my eyes at her when all I’m doing is just looking at her this time was no different she thought I was rolling my eyes and hit me with a plate she aimed for my head but I blocked it with my arm I got a bruise but it wasn’t that visible and I got a wound (kinda looking like a dot of blood but at the same time it wasn’t bleeding) she continued yelling at me.... 
but now around two weeks later she hasn’t hit me since then (she has insulted me once again for things I couldn’t possibly control) but today she apologized after asking why I wasn’t that close with her and seemed to be “unhappy with her” so I mentioned the fact that she strangled me and she blamed it on me said it was my fault cuz I did (once again something I couldn’t possibly control) anyway later she came to my room and just said she wanted to make up with me.. so she said just sorry and kept on talking my door was closed but she kept asking for me to open it.. eventually I got kinda tired of hearing the same thing over and over again so I opened my door cuz I knew she probably wasn’t gonna go away.. she kinda hugged me all happy like a little child when she said something like yay or yes she forgives me or something like that.. but idk she could start hurting me at anytime again.. also even if she doesn’t am I supposed to just let it go as if it never happened in the first place I feel like I’m being over dramatic for not just letting it go.. and even though she did all that a lot I barely got any bruises so was it really that bad? Also would anyone even believe me if I tell them with zero evidence... it’s not like I have nightmares or something.. sometimes I do think she’s gonna hit me again and I flinch but that’s really all....... 

(TL;DR: so my mom with psychosis started “disciplining”(for stuff I couldn’t control) (and threatening to kill me) me a while ago but the last time she did it was a few weeks ago and she apologized today, she could do it anytime again but could also not.. do idk what to do...btw I’m a 13 girl with two brothers..and my dad lives in another city he’s coming to visit tomorrow tho..(before This she acted abusive towards my stepdad (who would never hurt her btw) but he committed... a few years ago also I don’t live in the US so the rules might be a bit different here)",domesticviolence

Can't do it alone,,domesticviolence
Do I even have the right to be mad? (Mental health issues as an explanation for abusive behavior),"This is going to be a really long one, but if anyone can stick with it, I’d really appreciate it. 

(Some background information: I’m transgender female-to-male and had been struggling a long time with my sexuality)

I dated a guy (we’ll call him Michael) for 11 months. I knew going into the relationship that he identified as asexual and I was fine with that. A little while into the relationship, Michael told me that he was a survivor of sexual assault and had PTSD. He told me his triggers, and I made sure to avoid them at all costs. A few months into the relationship, Michael expressed that he was interested in trying sexual things with me. We went slow — I made sure I never pressured him to do anything he didn’t want to, I avoided his triggers, and frequently checked to see if everything was alright. Everything was going fine — sometimes he’d get upset or overwhelmed, but we’d stop immediately and I’d always be there to comfort him. Eventually he got a lot more comfortable with sex so it happened more often. Then the end of the semester came (we’re both in college), and he began getting really stressed. 

He was in crisis just about every day. I tried to be there for him whenever he was upset, but it was becoming extremely taxing on me and my own mental health. It got to the point that I couldn’t take it anymore, so I told him I was feeling extremely emotionally worn out and asked him to find someone else to talk to about his issues. He apologized, but he didn’t stop. In fact, it got worse. The smallest thing could send him into deep self loathing to the point that I was extremely afraid of saying anything that might set him off. He had hurt himself in front of me before, so I was always afraid of what he might do if I spoke up about how basically being his therapist was affecting me.

Needless to say, I was more than relieved when summer cam around and I could go back to my home all the way across the country. Over the summer, I finally started passing as male. I also started to realize that I didn’t feel comfortable with the romantic side of my relationship with Michael and came out to him as aromantic. He agreed to stop doing very overtly romantic things in order to make me more comfortable. However, he didn’t stop — he kept doing things that I was uncomfortable with, becoming inconsolable when I’d confront him, and telling me that it was his depression/PTSD that was making it hard for him to remember. I figured that I couldn’t be angry with him since it was his mental illness and was beyond his control, so I just sucked it up and didn’t say anything about it again. 

Summer ended and I went back to school for the fall. A month or two later, I realized I was also very uncomfortable with the sexual side of our relationship as well and ended up I coming out to him as asexual. We agreed that we’d have more of a dedicated partnership than a romantic relationship and that we wouldn’t do anything else sexual because I told him I was extremely uncomfortable with it. 

But again, even though he was a sexual assault survivor who was always pushing consent, he didn’t stop sexual advances. It would start gradually enough that I wouldn’t realize until it was too late (for example, we’d be laying down with each other in bed and suddenly I’d realize his hands were where I didn’t want them to be). At this point, I wanted to say no, but then I’d remember how he had banged his head against the wall as self-punishment and thought he didn’t deserve to live for forgetting to turn on the fan above the stove — what would he do if I told him he had done something sexual to me without his consent? Or implied that he had done the same thing that the person who assaulted him did? He had told me from the beginning of the relationship that that was his greatest fear. 

So, afraid of what he might do to himself if I spoke up, I just let it happen. I’d even comfort him afterwards when he’d get upset and tell me that he hadn’t even wanted to do it. It made absolutely no sense to me since I had asked for us to stop doing sexual things for an indefinite amount of time and now here I was, having to comfort him after he had gone ahead with sex anyways and then claimed he never wanted to do it in the first place. This happened a few times, and I blamed myself for having somehow probably pressured him — why else would he have done it? He was asexual after all, right? Anyways, I ended up breaking up with him after winter break when I realized that I wasn’t aromantic or asexual, I just liked women instead of men (at one point in my life liking women was considered gay since I was living as a girl, so bad reactions from others had pushed me to believe I was bisexual). 

I blocked Michael on every social media platform I could think of, but ended up confronting him through tumblr messaging, telling him what he had done to me and the damage it had caused. He replied by saying “I was trapped in my worst memories, and it made it hard to remember where I was, who I was with, what was talked about”. 

Now I’m trying to figure out how much he can really be held accountable for what he did. On one hand, he created an environment where saying no could be dangerous and he also initiated sex after I had withdrawn consent indefinitely. On the other hand, he had severe mental health issues. I’m struggling to figure out if I’m allowed to put the blame on him and how much his mental health issues made it so that it really wasn’t his fault. 

So basically, is he still to blame even if his mental health issues made him forget all those things? Or is it even possible that depression, PTSD, or OCD can make you forget things like that? (For context, he was still able to do fine in classes and didn’t seem extremely mentally impaired)",domesticviolence

A Letter To My Abusive Ex.,"An Open Letter To My Abusive Ex.

There was at time I felt safe with you by my side, there weren't many but this one I will carry always. See, people ask me why did you stay with him through all of that. That isn't an easy thing to explain to those who've never experienced violence and gas-lighting to the extent of diminishment of self. 
I guess I held onto that moment for deeper than I should have, perhaps because it was the only glisten of humanity I saw, even though it was for yourself. 
I was in labour with our son, far earlier than what doctors decide is viable life. We were in the hospital watching the clock, timing. You were there by my side. You were holding me telling me everything was going to be okay. You were my rock when I needed it the most. I know now that you didn't do it for me. That was an act for you and your observers because we both know that in their notes, your actions were the reason we were there.

When I look back, it is so blatantly clear. You were the hunter, I was your prey.

You used my fears and my secrets I confided to you, to chip away at my self, to wear me down and groom me into a drudge you controlled.

At every glisten of me you would suppress, with your words, your hands, and your prick. Every action, every utterance you did, stripped another layer from my spirit, what it was to be me, to live.

I couldn't see it then, I believed your lies that something must be wrong with me, though I see it now. Through your demons you battered me until who I was, was gone.

You had this power of forging me into believing everything you said, that I deserved it, that I was stupid, that I was worthless if not for that act you used against me, that I was fucked in the head.

You stripped me, in all ways, back to my bones. I had become nothing other than a shell and your slave. Even then though it wasn't good enough, you had taken away my family, my friends, marked my sanity and deprived my dignity. You still wanted more, so that Wednesday in May, you took my light too.

I was resigned. I had succumbed to your whim, this was all I am for the rest of my life until you decide my body was expendable too. I mattered no more and just waited for my death at your hands. When that didn't come (yet), you lost the control. I got out.

No longer could your words, or your fists or that grip on my wrist make me do what you wanted.

You couldn't bear people knowing all that you had done, how dare I tell. So you took that fear you induced, you took that pain you caused, you took my secrets I shared and tried to spread them in shame. You told the world trauma you inflicted on me was made up in my mind, you fought against onus and still do to this day, in your words by your postings ""I will win"".

Oh but honey, this isn't a game.

I know that in reading this, if you are ever compelled to, it probably turns you on. A small list of your achievements, you won't read this as ever having done anything wrong.
Though this isn't that. I'm not asking for recognition nor is it a gift of forgiveness, no. You don't deserve a place of peace in my heart and I don't care to give it because I am not afraid, I've already lived in hell.

I want you to know that in fact, in some way, I am grateful. See, without being completely broken I wouldn't have been able to build up. I couldn't have breathed without feeling safe, I couldn't have smiled without feeling happiness deep, I couldn't have felt without knowing strength. If not for all the torture you forced me through, I couldn't have become who I am today, proud, strong, brave and unashamed.

I did that.

You are nothing without triumph of my defeat. I am everything you don't want in me, and everything you wish people thought you could be.

I stand tall through the trauma, and the venom you spit. I'm unwavering in your last battle to make me quit because thanks to you, I have nothing to fear.
You have a lifetime of self vindicating, a lifetime of justifying incidences you won't admit but I, I have light and I have power, I own my shit. 

Its not my shame, it's yours.",domesticviolence
Family members try to fight me because I don’t let them control me.,So I’ve been the bread winner of my family for like 5 years I’m a 25 year old female who lives with my mom sister and my boyfriend. I don’t bother anyone I pretty much stay in my room and go to work. I only moved my boyfriend in to help me with bills since my mom and sister doesn’t want to get a job. They have a problem with anything me and my boyfriend do for example they have issues with what we spend our money on and places we go another example is if anything comes up missing they blame it on my boyfriend then find the items and never apologize. I never make big deals about It I just move on from it. Just recently I was on the phone talking to my friend and my sister comes banging at my door asking me why I’m talking about her which I wasn’t but even if I was how dare you break my door down and try to fight me over something your not sure is really going on. I’m very laid back I try to laugh everyday and be happy and people hate seeing that so they try to do anything to get me down. They only try to bother me when my boyfriend is at work which is funny. I feel like their jealous and bored with their lives so they want to bother me because they know I don’t like confrontation. I feel like they project all their insecurities onto me. I’m trying to save and move out but it’s hard.,domesticviolence
I’m really just talking about my problems here cause I have no one else to talk to..,"So I posted something in the night a few hours ago at like 1 am or something I’ve already deleted it by now but... it was just me explaining what my mom did.. and people were saying that it’s abuse if you haven’t seen the post (wich most likely you haven’t) I’m a 13 year old girl and I live with my mom and my older and younger brother.. my mom got diagnosed with psychosis a few years ago after we got involved with CPS they never really told us but I hear them talking about it and I found some medication that used used to treat that...(I was searching for something and came across it and googled it cuz I was curious) and also my mom has a certain way of saying that they diagnosed her.. so recently a few months ago she started (I’m so uncomfortable with the word) abusing me... the last time she hit me was two weeks ago with a plate long story short she said that I was rolling my eyes at her (I don’t know why but she always thinks that almost anytime I just look at her) yesterday... she was asking why I seemed “distant” or seemed like I didn’t really like her... so I mentioned something that happend a while ago where she strangled me.. at first she blamed it on me and said it was my fault for (something I didn’t do but she thought I did) then I went to my room and later she came and apologized... she kept on asking me to open my door eventually I did and she just hugged me and thought I forgave her I just went along with it my brothers seem to not be too bothered by any of it (they even made fun of me a few times when she hurt me) it’s like sometimes she’s just my mom and other times she hates me...

Some people in the replies kinda warned me that she’d probably do it again.. today I got scared and thought she would so this morning she got really mad because she found my older brothers keys outside and they’ve been there since yesterday she got really upset and said that anyone could’ve entered our house she started yelling at my brother who also got really mad and said that he wasn’t the one that left the keys there she said that they were his keys and he was responsible for it and he quickly tried to blame me for leaving the keys outside but I have my own keys and didn’t use his and he knows that but still started hitting and kicking my door trying to open it and threatening me all because he was tryna but my moms attention and the blame on me so he wouldn’t be yelled at or blamed for it then my mom came upstairs and he went to his room upset and then my mom started hitting and kicking my door (and blaming me for stuff that didn’t happen and I couldn’t control that also had nothing to do with the situation) I got scared because it reminded me of all the times she did that wich always led to her hurting me eventually she kicked it open like she always does she was upset but didn’t hurt me (luckily) but I could’ve made one wrong move and she would’ve... in that moment I did really wish I told someone because I got really scared but after wards I couldn’t imagine telling anyone...(i know it isn’t but it just really feels embarrassing)


so I didn’t really know what to do people in the replies from last night told me to tell someone.. but I don’t really know who I’m gonna tell... some people said my teacher but my mom chose to make me stay home because of the virus so I don’t go to school... and telling them online just seems awkward and I can’t even imagine how they’d react.
Then some people said to tell my dad.. but he only comes and visits sometimes and sometimes I text him but he doesn’t read the messages cuz he didn’t get them he was supposed to visit today but didn’t show up..(butmy mom and him are calling and playing a game with my little brother rn while my older brother plays a games with his friend) 
And then some people said tell you’re social worker well... I’ve really seen multiple people and honestly those are all people from CPS or they work close to them and I always tell them everything’s fine so telling any of them is just..embarrassing or awkward for me I don’t know how to talk to people well.. I’m always worried what they think of me.. also even though I’ve seen them a couple of times over the years it almost feels like they’re strangers.. and whenever I see them my moms there... and I have literally no evidence at all to show that what I’m saying is true I have like one bruise that’s almost completely gone and you can barely see so now I’m worried about who to tell.. how to tell them.. whether they’re gonna believe me or not..and how they’re gonna react and what they’re gonna do if I tell them.....and also people have it worse than me... the last time she hurt me was a while ago would it really count......
I know everything I said probably sounds irrational like why don’t I just tell someone why am I being like this... 
Okay so that was it for me ranting about my problems....

He's physically violent to me at times to the point where he's scarred/cut me on multiple occasions, he's beat me, said homophobic things to me, gaslit me.

To summarise, my housemate ('Alex') was escalating their behaviour of hitting, throwing stuff at me, and aggressive behaviour.

I moved out on Monday, and my housemate only caught me during my second trip and Alex asked if we could have a 'chat' and I said no.

I've since been told that Alex 'would like it if I contacted them directly as Alex would like to be able to discuss and resolve any problems which have occurred within your friendship' by a mutual friend (who doesn't know the details of the abuse).

Do I message Alex?

I was thinking along the lines of 'I understand you probably want an explanation as to why I moved out. Your behaviour when you are upset (I have personally witnessed/been on the receiving end of verbal abuse, throwing things, hitting, slapping, screaming, and more) is abusive and terrifying. When you confronted me with an issue you had out of the blue, you made me fear for my safety. I could not confront you, because it was not safe to. I left because I need to be safe.

Grandmother being Abused by son,"Hey,

first of all this is a throwaway for obvious reasons.

Since my Grandfather died
my Grandmother is being mentaly and physically abused by my uncle (her son).
She is currently staying at my house but wants to go back home because she misses home (I life about 1,5h away).
Her son has an apartment on his own but comes by her house regularly. He will threaten her and tell her shes worthless etc. And also hit her and push her around. Then wants my grandma to say sorry to him for making him angry.
My Grandmother defends him and says that he isn’t always like that. She just loves him too much to kick him out. 

Is there anyway I can help her ? I have been supporting her no matter what but she just seems to not recognise that shes being abused, since it has been increasing over time

What if?,"Throwaway acct. I’m in the middle of a shitshow with my soon to be ex husband who beat me back in late Nov. I didn’t file a police report initially or report him (he’s active mil), but did get treated and injuries documented at the ER the day after it happened. 

The situation has been strange, he’s taken on a pattern of being verbally/financially/emotionally abusive now. 

Days ago I filed the police report and gave them all supporting documentation/photos/evidence. Unfortunately the detectives in Victim Advocacy at the substation I went to have a 30 day processing period before it’s even considered for prosecution by the DA—IF it even gets that far, due to the length of time that’s passed (approx 6 months).

I also filed for divorce but due to COVID, it’s taking more time for petitions to be filed and served. I filed back in Dec, but put  it on hold because I was a dumbass and thought counseling would help. 

One thing I’m curious about. My husband has a child from a previous marriage and another from a relationship between marriages where it was “one shot one kill.” He has unofficial primary custody of the child from his first marriage (mom didn’t want to mom so they reversed their possession periods and she sent her to live w/us during the school year). Their divorce decree was never changed to reflect this. Just a notarized letter. 

The child between marriages—he had no relationship with him and wasn’t present for the birth or for the first few years (he’s 3 and I just found out my husband met him for the first time last weekend—must be guilt). 

With our youngest, shared child, I fully intend to go to blows with him over this as he’s mentioned he doesn’t care if he goes broke doing so, he’d fight me for primary custody. If it doesn’t work in his favor, will it surface that he’s got domestic abuser status and will the court (or whomever) notify the other mothers? I’m sorry if it’s a stupid question and if it’s been asked before. Thanks in advance.",domesticviolence

He tried to force me to tell people I was lying.,"I was in a relationship for 5 years. I was 14 years old when we met, 15 when we started dating, 19 when we broke up, but 20 when things were officially over. The emotional abuse was present the entire time. He would get jealous of any and everybody I came in to contact with. This goes as deep as he got angry at me during my sisters graduation party because I hugged my older male cousin. I never had guy friends. My entire high school experience was spent providing for my boyfriend because his mother didn't give him much. I payed for everything, drove him everywhere, supported every single thing he did. The domestic abuse started when I was about 18. I don't know who hit first. But I do know that he did not hold back. Sometimes Id start the fight, sometimes he would, but I was always the one that left with bruises and scars. One day he hacked into my phone and deleted all the evidence I had against him. He had given me 2 black eyes, I had finger print bruises all over my arm, he broke my phone into shattered pieces in my dorm room, pushed me against the bed so hard my knee also has a scar. The only photo I have of the abuse is one of a tortilla sized bruise with a gash on my thigh that he gave me when he grabbed me so hard in a car then pushed me out of it in a gas station parking lot and abandoned me. That was the day we broke up. A year later (after much more emotional abuse in the time between) I decided to expose him to most of my friends for what he did to me. Apparently one of them said something to him and he made a lot of fake numbers to get in contact with me (I've since changed my number) but overall he did get in contact with me. He told me I was a liar and that I need to tell everyone the truth: Hes not an abuser and is a really sweet and nice guy. He made me feel horrible. He made me feel like I ruined his life for speaking about my experiences. He told me I'm disgusting and just a white girl who wants to ruin a black males life which I would NEVER do. I would NEVER lie about domestic violence and especially not use my privilege for people to believe me. This abuse ACTUALLY HAPPENED to me and caused major trauma. Am I wrong for telling people what happened to me? Am I a horrible person? He told me every time he hit me was a byproduct of my own actions... what did I do to deserve that when I was literally a mother figure in his life while also being a girlfriend in my TEEN years?

He claps at her to get her attention like an animal, and talks down to her constantly. Recently she had their first child, and things have definitely escalated with the stress of/control issues surrounding  their new baby. Sometimes we say something to refute what he's saying if he says something such as ""Jane, you're a bad mother"", we might respond ""Jane, I think youre doing a great job"".

However, Jane has confided in private that she'd prefer if we didnt say anything as it would only make it worse for her. She says she knows he was this way when she decided to marry him and she will put up with it. This is so worrying to me as, especially during the lockdown, who knows what she is having to put up with if he hasn't been able to hold it together just for the few times we've seen them in the past 6 months. 

Their child is certainly already being affected by the yelling and vitriol of their parent's relationship... she rarely sleeps, is colicky and seems ill at ease compared with other children the same age. It could be a coincidence for the time being, or a projection on my part, but there's no way this poor girl will remain unharmed.

Recently Tom started talking about how he throws and breaks things and has outbursts of rage frequently at home directed at Jane. And a couple weeks ago he got out of his car to threaten another driver in a fit of road rage. Obviously this escalation is extremely concerning for Jane, so I am going to speak to her safely away from Tom on Monday. My question is what things should I say and how should I approach this extremely sensitive topic? and is there anything I can do for her without reporting this to the police? (there are no womens or social work groups locally)  Thank you for any help.",domesticviolence
I don’t know what to do with him anymore. What should I do?,"I’ve posted on here maybe once or twice, I’m not sure. I’ve still been trying to keep track of everything he has done but haven’t been the best at it. 
A couple days ago my friends, myself and boyfriend went out of town together in our new car. While there, he decided to go visit his SICK brother who lives 1-2 hours away. He left without letting anyone know and when we would ask where he was he would say he was at the store. We all believed him because no one had eaten all day except for himself. Fast forward, because of the current situation we told him as a group we decided he should stay at his brothers since he could potentially have corona. He went ballistic and decided to come pick up his things in order to drive all the way back home. Even though we all (in exception for our friend who already lived in the area) came together in the new car. Through the phone he called me names and a friend who kind of knew about how he treats me hung up.
After a while after he came to pick up his things and yell at me from the balcony for the second time, I might add, I called him to make sure his drive was going smoothly. I told him he hurt our friends feelings after deciding to leave and continuously lie to them. He lost it. No lie. He started screaming at the top of his lungs, “YOURE A SNAKE! YOURE A SNAKE! I KNOW HOW YOU WORK. YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO HELP ME FIX THINGS, YOU COULDVE STOPPED THIS FROM HAPPENING. I HURTY OUR FRIENDS? LET ME RAM THIS CAR INTO A WALL AND THEN I CAN REALLY HURT THEIR FEELINGS. TELL ME AGAIN I HURT THEIR FEELINGS. TELL ME AGAIN. IM THE VICTIM NOT  YOU. ITS ME. ITS ALWAYS BEEN ME.” I started crying repeating no and no begging him to calm down. And then he hung up. 
A couple days ago he got mad at me because I started crying and decided to drive our car at 100 mph weaving through traffic. He then said “I wonder what would happen if I rammed this car into that bridge over there. What do you think babe?” I had to snap out of it and talk to him about my day in order to pretend everything was fine. 
After talking with our friends, we came to the conclusion he has either DID or schizo since he hears voices all the time which tell him to “get rid of her (me).” He has even chocked me during intimacy. I’m in constant fear he will either hurt me or himself. 
In my position what would y’all do? Where can I get help for him before this gets worse? Is there someone I can call that will force him to get the help he needs?",domesticviolence
Scars from the past,"I was in a relationship with a man for 5 years. He is an alcoholic, and while he wasn't physically and sexually abusive until the very end of the relationship back in August, he was often emotionally and psychologically abusive.

Yesterday it rained where I was. The weather was quite weird for where we are and the sky was a dark cloudy grey. The weather reminded me of this trip that we took to Alaska together. By all means it should have been a great trip. We went with my best friend from college and we got to see the northern lights.

However, there was a night that we left my friends behind and it was just me and him going in search of the northern lights. He got incredibly drunk, as per usual. He was driving us back to the hotel in our rental car and he was swerving a bit on this empty country road. I asked him to please pull over because I was scared and instead of pulling over, he drove faster and started swerving on purpose. I started screaming and threatened to jump out of the moving car. I even opened the door and was ready to jump until he pulled over. I ran outside and sat in the snow and refused to come back in. Dying from hypothermia was preferable to dying in a drunken crash.

I was driving when this memory hit me and I started panicking a bit. It felt so real, like I was there again.

I got to my current boyfriend's place and told him all about it and how scared I was. My current boyfriend is an angel and accepts me even though I have all these problems. My current boyfriend told me last night that he loved me, but I couldn't say it back. How can he be so sure already??? All I could think of was how broken I am and how I'm still thinking about my ex. I'm worried that I still love my ex even though everyone around me agrees that there was abuse.",domesticviolence
I think im being abused and I just need to tell someone,"I don't even know where to start. I have a history of being sexually assaulted, depression and suicidal thoughts and attempts. My (24f) husband (26m) and I have been together 5 years, got engaged and had 2 children. We were married in march. He's always been extremely jealous and controlling, but I felt pressure to stay work things out (yeah I know stupid me). 

This year things have gotten so much worse. Im a stay at home mom, I never leave the house because he either doesn't want to watch the kids or doesn't think its fair because he doesn't have any friends. I try to encourage him to make plans with someone but he wont. He always tells me how much he hates my friends because they drink and he doesn't want me to drink too. I've gone to a bar twice in the last 3 years and I hardly ever drink at home. 

We tried marriage counseling, and the counselor suggested I get a job because I'm depressed, exhausted and desperately need to interact with adults. I'm so lonely. Then covid-19 hit and there went my job searching. Im looking for one now but every one I mention to him he shits on and says I should just stay home. ""You would just get hit on anyways"" is what he says. Ridiculous.  

I had been on zoloft to treat my depression, but it caused me to lower my sex drive. That, coupled with the stress of raising 2 babies who REFUSED to sleep, you can imagine that part of our life stopped completely. He made get off completely. I didn't want to because it my life tolerable. I became depressed again and STILL didn't want sex. Over the weeks, maybe months, he coerced me into sex so many times after I clearly said no over and over. He even touched/penetrated me in my sleep. I have no idea how many times, I've only woken up to it twice. He let me drink one night, and he got drunk too. I was too drunk to do anything and he took advantage, even hit multiple times and had bruises the next day. 

Fast forward to this month, I had started seeing a counselor, to help me through my depression and stress. I told her how exhausted I was, and suggested I need to get out of the house at least 4-6 hours a week. I talked to my husband about what she said, and he immediately attacked me. ""well what about me? You are just gonna go out and drink and find someone else"" I told him no, I was planning on going out and joining a protest with my sister, Id forgotten how passionate I am my community and being involved. He lets me go. But not without a fight. ""Why are you putting makeup on? You never do that for me!"" Yes I do. ""Why are you brushing your teeth, plan on kissing someone?"" Apparently hygiene equals cheating. It goes on until I leave. I come back and he digs through my pockets and finds my lipgloss. ""What do you need this for? It's flavored!"" It's the only lip gloss I own. ""Are you seriously saying I'm cheating because I wore lipgloss?"" He responded ""if the shoe fits!"" 

Today I was going through my Google drive and found old pics of me and my friend when she was modeling that I had pretty much forgotten about. They are from 4 years ago, some are ""promiscuous"" as in they show my butt (kinda). I'm going through them and thought he would get a laugh at how dumb and terrible they were. He flips a switch and immediately starts attacking me accusing me of hiding them from him because ""you knew I would never approve of you doing THAT!"" But back then I did show them to him, they were horrible and I only saved like 3 of them. He knew about the photoshoot. I never hid anything from him. ""You did hide them from me, and makes me wonder what else you're hiding!"" I couldn't take the accusations anymore, I said im going to my moms to drop off my sister (she witnessed everything and has seen/heard much more in past arguments). I go upstairs to put on a bra and he follows me. ""What do you need a bra for? What are you really going to?"" Why am I not allowed to wear a bra now? What the fuck? 

There's hundreds of incidents like this, the fights last for hours, sometimes days. I feel like im leaving so much out, but I cant make this post too long.

In the car with my sister, she tells me I need to get out NOW. That what he's doing is abusive but it hasn't really occurred to me. I've always felt scared around him and she explained that's his way of controlling me and now it all makes sense. I feel so stupid and hurt",domesticviolence
I need advice,"I(17F) have dealt with abusers my whole life and written about it multiple times. But this post, surprisingly isn't about me. I live in a flat, in a relatively nice neighbourhood and my neighbours are mostly fine. In september, a man who is a heroin addict moved into an appartment next to mine. We didn't have any problems with him and he didn't bother anyone. A week ago, i was home alone when i heard the door bell ring 3 times frantically. I rushed to open the door and saw an unknown woman obviously high on drugs, breathing heavily, crying and clutching her stomach. The addict was going towards her and i immediately closed the door. I was scared shitless. I didn't quite know what happened and i tried to process it but couldn't. And then yesterday, while my mom was home with me, we heard screams and cries and bangs so loud i jumped from my chair. We looked through the peep hole and i saw the same woman with the addict guy. She was running up and down the stairs, again obviously high, screaming that he was hitting her and that he took her phone so she couldn't call the police. She was ringing neighbours doorbells but no one opened because we were all so frightened. My mom said she was afraid one of them will end up dead. That lasted for over an hour. In the end she went back to the apartment with him. I felt so bad for not helping her, but i know they are both addicts and i was afraid one of them would hurt me or my mom. What should i do the next time something like this happens? I'm also afraid to call the police because they would probably arrest them both because of drugs, and that i would do more harm to her than good.",domesticviolence
So I kinda need advice (I also posted this on another subreddit),"So my mom started “kinda” abusing me a while ago here’s why I say kinda
So she first started by standing on me when she thought I was pregnant even though I was just twelve back then (a few months ago) and I had no boyfriend and it was just and irregular period (she didn’t even let me take the test) 
But then after wards she started doing stuff like trying to stab me with scissors, chasing me trough the house with knives, threatening to kill me, forcing me to take 3 strips of birth control....cause she thought I was pregnant and we are already involved with cps (they don’t know about this) and she doesn’t want my brothers (and apparently me) to get taken away from her.. 
she was also diagnosed with psychosis a few years ago.. so she kinda has this weird story that’s she keeps on saying, that’s kinda like she thinks people can read her mind , if she sees anything on internet she pretends it’s aimed directly at her and says people are bullying her (it doesn’t even have to be bad) so once I heard yelling from downstairs and then she came to my door mad and kept on telling me to open it I was scared so I kept on saying stuff to stall like “why?” “I don’t want to if ur gonna hurt me...” she ended up kicking the door open and strangling me...
She’s hit me with a broom/mop stick before 
A piece of wood (it broke, but she used the excuse that it was already breaking even though I’m sure it wasn’t) etc.
But it’s like sometimes she’s like that and other times she’s acting as if she loves me...
Like around two weeks ago is the last time she hurt me, my school changed the transportation for school and said that someone would drive the students that live far away (including me) but then changed it again and said that wasn’t gonna happen she got mad and started blaming me for it and went into my room yelling for me to call my homeroom teacher I was looking at her cuz other wise she’d probably find it disrespectful but at the same time hoping that she didn’t think I was rolling my eyes cuz she often says that I’m rolling my eyes at her when all I’m doing is just looking at her this time was no different she thought I was rolling my eyes and hit me with a plate she aimed for my head but I blocked it with my arm I got a bruise but it wasn’t that visible and I got a wound (kinda looking like a dot of blood but at the same time it wasn’t bleeding) she continued yelling at me.... 
but now around two weeks later she hasn’t hit me since then (she has insulted me once again for things I couldn’t possibly control) but today she apologized after asking why I wasn’t that close with her and seemed to be “unhappy with her” so I mentioned the fact that she strangled me and she blamed it on me said it was my fault cuz I did (once again something I couldn’t possibly control) anyway later she came to my room and just said she wanted to make up with me.. so she said just sorry and kept on talking my door was closed but she kept asking for me to open it.. eventually I got kinda tired of hearing the same thing over and over again so I opened my door cuz I knew she probably wasn’t gonna go away.. she kinda hugged me all happy like a little child when she said something like yay or yes she forgives me or something like that.. but idk she could start hurting me at anytime again.. also even if she doesn’t am I supposed to just let it go as if it never happened in the first place I feel like I’m being over dramatic for not just letting it go.. and even though she did all that a lot I barely got any bruises so was it really that bad? Also would anyone even believe me if I tell them with zero evidence... it’s not like I have nightmares or something.. sometimes I do think she’s gonna hit me again and I flinch but that’s really all....... 

(TL;DR: so my mom with psychosis started “disciplining”(for stuff I couldn’t control) (and threatening to kill me) me a while ago but the last time she did it was a few weeks ago and she apologized today, she could do it anytime again but could also not.. do idk what to do...btw I’m a 13 girl with two brothers..and my dad lives in another city he’s coming to visit tomorrow tho..(before This she acted abusive towards my stepdad (who would never hurt her btw) but he committed... a few years ago also I don’t live in the US so the rules might be a bit different here)",domesticviolence

Narcissism or legit sociopath?,"Looking back on the stories I’ve been through...I’m wondering if it’s possible my ex has more going on than just NPD. Could he be an actual sociopath? Idk...

Here’s some examples:

He brought me to a bank and had me sign a paper with a legit notary “promising to give away my unborn child”. This was against my will. The only reason I did it was so he’d give me a ride to the airport so I could leave his ass. He Harassed me all summer to give away the baby before I “corrupted it” (while I was still pregnant) THEN he tried to use this notarized paper against me in a custody dispute. Claiming to be dad of the year. (Now he’s an absent parent)

Here’s another fun one. He got me intoxicated, allowed his friend to sexually assault me. Convinced me I’d consented to it. And then a year later allowed the same friend to MOVE INTO OUR FUCKING HOUSE against my consent. And literally made me feel GUILTY because I understandably didn’t want his friend living there.... Then in front of me and this friend, he commented that he would be ok with allowing other men to have sex with me as long as he was in the room.  Like what the actual f^%%

One last one: He got me to drop out of nursing school, so I’d be able to move away with him. So I did what he said. Once we moved away I switched majors. He proceeded to try and tell me that I was a failure for dropping out of nursing school. And that my new major was worthless and I should’ve asked permission first. 




I think my ex is actually a legit sociopath. Not just NPD but like....complete psycho.",domesticviolence
Brother (38) is a massive threat towards my dad (74). Very concerned for his safety.,"If you wanna be spared years of backstory/experiences, then read only the first paragraph, Summary and Conclusion. Rest is just details explaining the type of abuse and problems my brother has caused.

&amp;#x200B;

Hey everyone,

For starters, this is a throwaway account for obvious reasons, but I'm wanting to ask the internet for some serious advice that my family may not be able to come up with ourselves. It's going to be a pretty lengthy and detail-saturated post, but it's probably best I lay it all out there to really understand the entire picture and what kind of person my brother is.

My brother (38), who lives with my dad (74), has not physically harmed my dad yet, but the possibility keeps increasing with time. What he has done though, is caused a tremendous amount of psychological stress and financial damage.

I want my dad to stop living in fear. His life honestly is not good right now, and it could be if my brother weren't in the picture. I ask for any advice in which my family can use to remove my brother from our lives, or at the very least, my dad's house.

I unfortunately live about an hour half from my dad, and my other brother lives about 30 min, but still it's too far in case there's an emergency. My dad sorta makes matters worse by protecting my brother and covering for him sometimes. He just wants peace and nothing else so he tries to sit on the fence and pretend things are fine, but other times he admits he wishes he was gone.

&amp;#x200B;

# Summary:

My brother has had consistent drug and/or mental relapses, which include several physical assaults, verbal assaults, years of jail time, and even death threats against my dad. He shows no signs or ability to reason with anyone or anything, and recently his mental state has decayed so much I don't even consider him a functional adult any longer. He's been basically unemployed for about 10 or more years now living off my dad's income.  He's basically just a hollow shell that nobody wants to be around in fear that something might trigger him. He's potentially very dangerous and at his best, he's still an enormous financial strain and source of stress.

He's had a very up-and-down life since he was 16. He's always been a pretty big troublemaker, but around 18 he was prescribed painkillers (Vicodin) for an injury he sustained. This led him down a never ending road of substance abuse. He was a functional adult back then, but just had an addiction that we all felt he could get past. The entire family was always supportive of him getting clean, but his recoveries always led to a relapse. Each time we all kept encouraging him to get better, and to try again. We were very sympathetic for him. We truly were on his side.

Unfortunately his life never had any stability in it. We believe he's gotten to a point now that he will never change. Sadly his mind just seems to be gone now from all the drugs he's done (he's admitted to mixing pills, using heroine, and a litany of methods to get high that I never heard of. There's nothing left of him that resemble the ""good"" parts of him. Now days he rambles about religion 24/7 as he's become a fanatic, and complains no one loves Jesus as much as he does and how everyone is a fake christian (even entire churches), he confuses being high with feeling the holy spirit etc. Just very unusual behavior all the time that it's just his new normal. Basically he's so unhinged lately, that he's become even more unpredictable, and that scares us.

Nobody really knows for sure if my brother has a mental disorder, has fried his brain, or is just constantly under the influence. My brother never shares doctor information, and the doctors he claims he goes to all sound fake/sketchy so I don't know the validity of anything he tells us. It doesn't help that my dad obfuscates details in his older age a lot more than he used to so we're going to only work with the information I can confirm from my own experiences or through my other brother.

There's so many incidents he's caused, I don't think I can confidently recall them all so I'll just categorize each type of incident and list the most memorable and you can read or skip ahead as you please.

&amp;#x200B;

# Car accidents:

I think he's wrecked about 6 vehicles? Maybe more? A few were ""his"" that my dad bought him, and the rest were my parents' personal vehicles. Amazingly, he hasn't harmed or killed anyone in any of his car accidents, mainly because he doesn't make it very far from his origin and crashes all by himself due to being so inebriated. All vehicles were totaled.

He's wrapped a truck around a mailbox while drunk driving.

* Flipped my mom's Trailblazer after jumping a driveway culvert and landing on a neighbors fence.
* Flipped my mom's Suburban after going into a ditch off the side of the road.
* Yelled at my mom from the passenger seat, where she became so stressed out and accidentally drove her car through their brick garage wall (everyone was okay).
* Caused a 3+ car pile up at a traffic light where he failed to stop. He got injured pretty good, but nothing serious.

His most recent wreck (early this year) and the biggest aftermath, was right after he quit his job of one week and claimed Jesus told him to ""turn the wheel right"" while on the highway. He swerved into the right-side guardrail until coming to a stop where a good Samaritan stopped to assist. My brother then attacks the man until police show up and he attacks the officer as well. It was later discovered he had shoplifted a bunch of clothes. He was arrested obviously. He was in jail for about a month, but eventually was released and showed up back at my dad's.

One of my biggest concerns here is not himself, but the safety of other drivers on the road. I fear he will get someone killed eventually. Nobody feels like they can simply take keys away from him, either. My dad begs to keep peace, and I fear he will take his anger out on my dad in a physical way when no one is there to step in. It seems like we lose any decision we make.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# Financial Burdens:

Before my mom passed away in 2016, she for the most part, kept my brother in check with her motherly presence. Since then though, my brother has only gotten worse. He was always more tolerable with my mom, but now that he directly has to deal with my dad more often, he is a lot more aggressive.

My dad is too ...nice, afraid, guilty...whatever you want to call it to simply evict my brother. Everyone knows that if he were to kick him out, his reaction would be unpredictable. Ranging anywhere from my brother getting himself killed in a car accident, overdose, violent encounter with someone, or my brother would simply not comply and remain in the house and use physical force if he had to. All of these possibilities make it hard for my dad to make a decision on what to do. Here's some facts about my brother regarding financial burdens:

* He can't hold a job. He occasionally gets a decent job but will blow it in about a month and blames the employer. I can't keep track of how many times he's been fired. He hardly looks for work, and will only consider work positions that aren't beneath him, thus he rarely gets hired anywhere. Over the last decade, he's mostly spent his time sitting at home or fishing with the use of my dad and his (now former) girlfriend's money.
* He was looking to buy a car, but when the salesman ""offended"" him, he pretended to be a bigshot and took his business across the street and literally bought a \~$70k truck that he 9000% can't afford. Somehow my dad ended up making the $700 dollar payments for him. (this is the truck that is now totaled after ""Jesus"" told him to crash it).
* He is currently a patient of a methadone clinic, and I don't know the details but I'm to understand it's not cheap.
* He receives money from my dad to go buy chewing tobacco whenever he runs out
* Just today I found out my brother stole my dad's credit card, stole my dad's car, bought himself a new phone, venmo'd himself $500 and for some reason called 911 and told the dispatcher my dad was having a heart attack and was showing signs of dementia (He wasn't and he isn't). Luckily the paramedics didn't fine my dad or anything.
* He eats a huge amount of food and it's causing my dad to have to grocery shop more often to keep the kitchen stocked.
* He generally breaks household items on accident a lot and my dad has to replace them.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# Acts of aggression:

All of these acts of aggression are him being under the influence of ""something"". When he's sober, he's typically a normal person. He comes across like a tough guy still, but generally doesn't act nearly a irrational. He doesn't drink since his teenage days really, so we can only assume he is mixing pills. When he's ""high"" he just becomes very dopey in behavior. His voice becomes lower, slower and his eyes look sleepy. However, he is at his most sensitive in this stage and feels like everyone is constantly judging him, but he reacts with aggression, mostly getting in peoples faces, spitting, headbutting, yelling etc.

I just want to be clear that nobody provokes him ever. He is 100% the bully in all situations. Every case is the same where he will take offense to something as minor as disagreeing with him on what temperature to set the oven, or telling him to give you a little space while he speaks, because he's getting spit on your face.

It'd be impossible to list every time he's verbally abused someone or made some threats, but some notable events are:

* Received a phone call in 2013 from my mom saying she and my dad were locked in their bedroom and he was trying to break the door down to get to them.
* Headbutt me sometime around 2012 to make me fight him when I was angry with him for being high and incoherently rambling to me.
* Several instances with my other brother where they got into fist-fights because he was acting belligerent and insulting my mom, and he didn't appreciate being confronted.
* Ex-friend of my brother confided this year that my brother told him he would kill my dad if my dad did not keep paying my brothers truck payments.
* I already mentioned he recently attacked a good Samaritan and police officer this year.
* Not an aggressive act, but several times he's gone schizophrenic and claimed crazy things like our nephews were inside his washing machine and sobbing that he couldn't get them out. This particular incident was around 2008 or 2009 and we later found out he mixed his methadone with other pills that caused him to hallucinate.

When he's not being hotheaded and looking to start a fight with someone, he generally is so doped out that he could pass out and fall asleep in the middle of the kitchen floor or just sleeping in his room. When he sleeps is when everyone can escape the insanity for a little bit.

&amp;#x200B;

# Conclusion:

I know some responses will be tempted to provide drug addiction help, but please try to keep in mind my family's priority is to keep my dad safe first. If my brother can be helped, then that's great, but we've all given him literally every chance to redeem himself, get help, etc  and I don't want my dad to live with him another minute if possible. He has proven time after time that he does not want any help. He is overflowing with confidence and actually thinks very highly of himself. He's convinced himself that he is superior in every way and any misfortune he's had is just the world pushing down good people.

We keep hoping he'll get arrested again and go away for an actual long time, but somehow the longest he's ever stayed in jail was a little over a year. He's a good faker when he knows he needs to be, so he knows how to fool people into thinking he's ""functional"" enough. First impression of him from the perspective of a complete stranger, and you'd just think he's a really strange guy who seems kinda toxic, but doesn't technically cross any lines.

This has been the most frustrating part. What he's doing should be illegal, but the police don't seem to care that an abusive family member can intimidate his way into being a lifelong leech on his own father. Please, please let us know if there's some program or anything out there that can help us out.

What do you do to find catharsis of the abuse?,"I can't speak up to ever voice my own opinion to him. I can't throw and break things, like he does. I can't really talk to anyone, unless I delete the evidence I was venting. I absolutely can't do anything with a hint of something being wrong, otherwise it will be punishment. I try to listen to music that speaks to me, talk to friends (whenever it's in my possibility) and vape THC oil. What do you do that helps? There's no judgement here.

To summarise, my housemate ('Alex') was escalating their behaviour of hitting, throwing stuff at me, and aggressive behaviour.

I moved out on Monday, and my housemate only caught me during my second trip and Alex asked if we could have a 'chat' and I said no.

I've since been told that Alex 'would like it if I contacted them directly as Alex would like to be able to discuss and resolve any problems which have occurred within your friendship' by a mutual friend (who doesn't know the details of the abuse).

Do I message Alex?

I was thinking along the lines of 'I understand you probably want an explanation as to why I moved out. Your behaviour when you are upset (I have personally witnessed/been on the receiving end of verbal abuse, throwing things, hitting, slapping, screaming, and more) is abusive and terrifying. When you confronted me with an issue you had out of the blue, you made me fear for my safety. I could not confront you, because it was not safe to. I left because I need to be safe. When you need to contact me about bills, post, etc, please go through \[landlord\]'",domesticviolence

Advice for outside observer,"My neighbor screams at his wife for 30 minutes at a time, like full bore top of his lungs screaming, maximum energy. He accuses her of lying, blames her for his voice being hoarse, saying that she is driving him crazy, etc. It's shocking to me. It happens maybe every 1-2 months. I never see her alone. Apparently they work in the same place, so come home together. He sounds unhinged. Sometimes she screams back but I can't hear her. I assume she's locked in a bathroom or something. There is running and banging but I don't hear any violence- yet. It sounds like mental torture. Calling police is useless to me. I don't know what to do. I fear for her safety.",domesticviolence

Grandmother being Abused by son,"Hey,

first of all this is a throwaway for obvious reasons.

Since my Grandfather died
my Grandmother is being mentaly and physically abused by my uncle (her son).
She is currently staying at my house but wants to go back home because she misses home (I life about 1,5h away).
Her son has an apartment on his own but comes by her house regularly. He will threaten her and tell her shes worthless etc. And also hit her and push her around. Then wants my grandma to say sorry to him for making him angry.
My Grandmother defends him and says that he isn’t always like that. She just loves him too much to kick him out. 

Is there anyway I can help her ? I have been supporting her no matter what but she just seems to not recognise that shes being abused, since it has been increasing over time

I would be so grateful for anyone giving advice and feel free to ask questions on detail.",domesticviolence
What if?,"Throwaway acct. I’m in the middle of a shitshow with my soon to be ex husband who beat me back in late Nov. I didn’t file a police report initially or report him (he’s active mil), but did get treated and injuries documented at the ER the day after it happened. 

The situation has been strange, he’s taken on a pattern of being verbally/financially/emotionally abusive now. 

Days ago I filed the police report and gave them all supporting documentation/photos/evidence. Unfortunately the detectives in Victim Advocacy at the substation I went to have a 30 day processing period before it’s even considered for prosecution by the DA—IF it even gets that far, due to the length of time that’s passed (approx 6 months).

I also filed for divorce but due to COVID, it’s taking more time for petitions to be filed and served. I filed back in Dec, but put  it on hold because I was a dumbass and thought counseling would help. 

One thing I’m curious about. My husband has a child from a previous marriage and another from a relationship between marriages where it was “one shot one kill.” He has unofficial primary custody of the child from his first marriage (mom didn’t want to mom so they reversed their possession periods and she sent her to live w/us during the school year). Their divorce decree was never changed to reflect this. Just a notarized letter. 

The child between marriages—he had no relationship with him and wasn’t present for the birth or for the first few years (he’s 3 and I just found out my husband met him for the first time last weekend—must be guilt). 

With our youngest, shared child, I fully intend to go to blows with him over this as he’s mentioned he doesn’t care if he goes broke doing so, he’d fight me for primary custody. If it doesn’t work in his favor, will it surface that he’s got domestic abuser status and will the court (or whomever) notify the other mothers? I’m sorry if it’s a stupid question and if it’s been asked before. Thanks in advance.",domesticviolence
I left my abuser 2 months ago and just found out I have high risk HPV...,"I’m angry and emotional. I’m only 24, and I just had a baby 6 months ago. I got a pap done about three weeks and my OB called me yesterday to tell me it was abnormal and i have high risk HPV. I got the vaccine as a little girl. The only two people I’ve ever had unprotected sex with are my rapist and my abuser. And I don’t know who I got it from because I don’t remember when my last pap was before this one.

Recently having more frequent bad dreams about abuser,It’s almost 3 am and I just woke up from a bad dream about my abusive ex. It’s been 12 years since I’ve seen him. My dreams aren’t about past abuse but just about him in general. Either he’s just there and that scares me or he’s abusing me in some way. These dreams have recently become more frequent. This last dream I escaped from a bathroom I was being held in and ran to a neighbor’s house. He found me and stabbed me with a broken off piece of wood. Then I woke up.

He tried to force me to tell people I was lying.,"I was in a relationship for 5 years. I was 14 years old when we met, 15 when we started dating, 19 when we broke up, but 20 when things were officially over. The emotional abuse was present the entire time. He would get jealous of any and everybody I came in to contact with. This goes as deep as he got angry at me during my sisters graduation party because I hugged my older male cousin. I never had guy friends. My entire high school experience was spent providing for my boyfriend because his mother didn't give him much. I payed for everything, drove him everywhere, supported every single thing he did. The domestic abuse started when I was about 18. I don't know who hit first. But I do know that he did not hold back. Sometimes Id start the fight, sometimes he would, but I was always the one that left with bruises and scars. One day he hacked into my phone and deleted all the evidence I had against him. He had given me 2 black eyes, I had finger print bruises all over my arm, he broke my phone into shattered pieces in my dorm room, pushed me against the bed so hard my knee also has a scar. The only photo I have of the abuse is one of a tortilla sized bruise with a gash on my thigh that he gave me when he grabbed me so hard in a car then pushed me out of it in a gas station parking lot and abandoned me. That was the day we broke up. A year later (after much more emotional abuse in the time between) I decided to expose him to most of my friends for what he did to me. Apparently one of them said something to him and he made a lot of fake numbers to get in contact with me (I've since changed my number) but overall he did get in contact with me. He told me I was a liar and that I need to tell everyone the truth: Hes not an abuser and is a really sweet and nice guy. He made me feel horrible. He made me feel like I ruined his life for speaking about my experiences. He told me I'm disgusting and just a white girl who wants to ruin a black males life which I would NEVER do. I would NEVER lie about domestic violence and especially not use my privilege for people to believe me. This abuse ACTUALLY HAPPENED to me and caused major trauma. Am I wrong for telling people what happened to me? Am I a horrible person? He told me every time he hit me was a byproduct of my own actions... what did I do to deserve that when I was literally a mother figure in his life while also being a girlfriend in my TEEN years? I've never felt more free in my life than not having any contact with him at all.",domesticviolence

How do I approach a friend in an abusive relationship?,"My boyfriend and I are friends with another couple, we'll call them Jane and Tom. At first we didnt notice anything awry, but their relationship soon showed its true colors in a nasty way. Jane seems subdued and as if she's walking on eggshells around Tom, but has a completely different and more vibrant personality when she's on her own. Tom more and more has been berating Jane for the tiniest things in front of us and our other friends, sometimes embarrassing Jane to the point of tears. 

He claps at her to get her attention like an animal, and talks down to her constantly. Recently she had their first child, and things have definitely escalated with the stress of/control issues surrounding  their new baby. Sometimes we say something to refute what he's saying if he says something such as ""Jane, you're a bad mother"", we might respond ""Jane, I think youre doing a great job"".

However, Jane has confided in private that she'd prefer if we didnt say anything as it would only make it worse for her. She says she knows he was this way when she decided to marry him and she will put up with it. This is so worrying to me as, especially during the lockdown, who knows what she is having to put up with if he hasn't been able to hold it together just for the few times we've seen them in the past 6 months. 

Their child is certainly already being affected by the yelling and vitriol of their parent's relationship... she rarely sleeps, is colicky and seems ill at ease compared with other children the same age. It could be a coincidence for the time being, or a projection on my part, but there's no way this poor girl will remain unharmed.

Recently Tom started talking about how he throws and breaks things and has outbursts of rage frequently at home directed at Jane. And a couple weeks ago he got out of his car to threaten another driver in a fit of road rage. Obviously this escalation is extremely concerning for Jane, so I am going to speak to her safely away from Tom on Monday. My question is what things should I say and how should I approach this extremely sensitive topic? and is there anything I can do for her without reporting this to the police? (there are no womens or social work groups locally)  Thank you for any help.",domesticviolence
I don’t know what to do with him anymore. What should I do?,"I’ve posted on here maybe once or twice, I’m not sure. I’ve still been trying to keep track of everything he has done but haven’t been the best at it. 
A couple days ago my friends, myself and boyfriend went out of town together in our new car. While there, he decided to go visit his SICK brother who lives 1-2 hours away. He left without letting anyone know and when we would ask where he was he would say he was at the store. We all believed him because no one had eaten all day except for himself. Fast forward, because of the current situation we told him as a group we decided he should stay at his brothers since he could potentially have corona. He went ballistic and decided to come pick up his things in order to drive all the way back home. Even though we all (in exception for our friend who already lived in the area) came together in the new car. Through the phone he called me names and a friend who kind of knew about how he treats me hung up.
After a while after he came to pick up his things and yell at me from the balcony for the second time, I might add, I called him to make sure his drive was going smoothly. I told him he hurt our friends feelings after deciding to leave and continuously lie to them. He lost it. No lie. He started screaming at the top of his lungs, “YOURE A SNAKE! YOURE A SNAKE! I KNOW HOW YOU WORK. YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO HELP ME FIX THINGS, YOU COULDVE STOPPED THIS FROM HAPPENING. I HURTY OUR FRIENDS? LET ME RAM THIS CAR INTO A WALL AND THEN I CAN REALLY HURT THEIR FEELINGS. TELL ME AGAIN I HURT THEIR FEELINGS. TELL ME AGAIN. IM THE VICTIM NOT  YOU. ITS ME. ITS ALWAYS BEEN ME.” I started crying repeating no and no begging him to calm down. And then he hung up. 
A couple days ago he got mad at me because I started crying and decided to drive our car at 100 mph weaving through traffic. He then said “I wonder what would happen if I rammed this car into that bridge over there. What do you think babe?” I had to snap out of it and talk to him about my day in order to pretend everything was fine. 
After talking with our friends, we came to the conclusion he has either DID or schizo since he hears voices all the time which tell him to “get rid of her (me).” He has even chocked me during intimacy. I’m in constant fear he will either hurt me or himself. 
In my position what would y’all do? Where can I get help for him before this gets worse? Is there someone I can call that will force him to get the help he needs?",domesticviolence
Scars from the past,"I was in a relationship with a man for 5 years. He is an alcoholic, and while he wasn't physically and sexually abusive until the very end of the relationship back in August, he was often emotionally and psychologically abusive.

Yesterday it rained where I was. The weather was quite weird for where we are and the sky was a dark cloudy grey. The weather reminded me of this trip that we took to Alaska together. By all means it should have been a great trip. We went with my best friend from college and we got to see the northern lights.

However, there was a night that we left my friends behind and it was just me and him going in search of the northern lights. He got incredibly drunk, as per usual. He was driving us back to the hotel in our rental car and he was swerving a bit on this empty country road. I asked him to please pull over because I was scared and instead of pulling over, he drove faster and started swerving on purpose. I started screaming and threatened to jump out of the moving car. I even opened the door and was ready to jump until he pulled over. I ran outside and sat in the snow and refused to come back in. Dying from hypothermia was preferable to dying in a drunken crash.

I was driving when this memory hit me and I started panicking a bit. It felt so real, like I was there again.

I got to my current boyfriend's place and told him all about it and how scared I was. My current boyfriend is an angel and accepts me even though I have all these problems. My current boyfriend told me last night that he loved me, but I couldn't say it back. How can he be so sure already??? All I could think of was how broken I am and how I'm still thinking about my ex. I'm worried that I still love my ex even though everyone around me agrees that there was abuse.",domesticviolence

Younger sister in abusive relationship,"My first post on this thread. For some background I’m 30 and my younger sister is 21. 
We have been generally close but she’s very introverted and to herself. 
Today I got news she gave birth. I had no idea she was pregnant she hid it from everyone except our parents and I was in the dark. 
I was ecstatic and everything until I found out her bf has hit her and cops have been involved. 
This changed everything my joy went to fear. 

The thing is that she made it sound like everything was great it wasn’t until I spoke to my dad that he told me what has been happening. 

I’m so scared for her now but don’t want to tell her I know: I’ve been casually joking she move into my house but don’t know how to go about it.

Advice for my escape plan,"Hello everyone, throwaway obviously because my abuser stalks both my main and alt accounts.

After 5 years together, and 4+ years of dealing with physical, emotional, and financial abuse, I am done. I have made a plan to move in with my cousin. Her and my best friend are the only two who have any idea what is going on in my relationship. Our lease begins the first week of July, and my god am i ready for my freedom.

Funnily enough (in a very morbid way) after I came back from the hospital today so get a sling around my arm because he tore my shoulder muscle from slamming me to the ground the other day, I got the call. “I’ve made the deposit, we move in the first week of July” I cried right there on the sidewalk. After years of abuse I’m going to be free.

My escape plan however, needs the kinks worked out. Due to the current world situation, im currently unemployed and he is working from home. I planned to leave and take my animals (all registered under my name and my name alone) when he was gone, but i now have no idea when that will happen. He has random parts hanging around the house that he’s trying to sell, i was honestly considering hiring someone in the ny/nj area to buy the part off of him and offer extra for him to drive to ship it to them so i can make my escape while he is gone. I’ve also contacted my bank to remove myself as an authorized used on our shared cc. Also our lease was up last year and we have been paying month to month so no problems there as well.

I know there is so much more that I need to do before leaving but I just want to make sure I do everything I can to keep him from finding me because I legitimately think he’ll try to kill me when he finds out. My dad is still paying for my phone while im in college so my abuser has no access to the account. I plan to change my phone number as well and tell all my fanily not to respond to any of his attempts to contact them.

Another issue is that we also go to the same university, we are both set to graduate next year. But since I am going through with this I wouldn’t feel safe at my university and plan on taking the year off. Not only for safety, but I’m going to need some serious mental health guidance after this, my grades are already in the toilet because of it so I need a break.

Other than the shared card, there’s no other money I owe him or have tied up with him anywhere.

Any advice or guidence through this time would be extremely helpful, I’ve never had to do anything like this in my life and I’m trying to do my best to protect myself and my animals. Thank you for listening.",domesticviolence
Dad is threatening my Mom if she doesn't transfer all her money to him today,"Hi,

I will first provide information about the urgent situation, and provide background information further down in the post.

I currently live in the US. My dad and mom live in Singapore with my younger brother who is in high school. My Dad has been abusive towards my mother for a long time; mostly emotionally and verbally, but has recently been physically abusive as well. My dad recently sold our house in Singapore, and put half the money from the sale into my mom's account, and my family has moved apartments a few times since.

Today he sent her a message saying that she had to transfer all the money to his account by the end of the day, and to send him her bank statements since Jan 2020. There was no explicit threat, but it is strongly implied by the history of abuse. My mom has reached out to a counsellor, who said that she needs to come in to the office in person to register for a case worker. My mom is afraid that if my dad finds out she's reached out to a counsellor, he will get violent. She is currently working from home, so is locked in her room and cannot leave until evening, after work, which is after the counsellor's office closes. We're afraid of what might happen at the end of the day if she's still at home and hasn't transferred the money (which she doesn't want to do for reasons explained below). She has reached out to the counsellor about the situation, but has not yet received a response.

She can go to my uncle's (mom's brother) house, which is where she's gone when things have gotten bad in the past. But she usually views this as a last-resort option as she doesn't like to burden her brother. She also doesn't usually leave the house during the day, so if she checks out of work and leaves to go to the counsellor's office, my dad will know something is up, and my mom doesn't like to leave my brother alone with him when he's angry.

What is the best course of action here? I understand that the laws in Singapore may be different from the laws in the US or wherever you're from, but any advice or insight is appreciated. I personally have no idea what to tell her, and feel guilty that I don't know what to do.

P.S. I have crossposted this to other subs. Please let me know if there is anywhere else I can post this to get some advice

\------

In the current apartment, my mom's monthly salary is equal to the monthly rent. My dad makes 4 times what my mom does (because she took many years off work to raise my brother and me, and is now above the age of 50). My dad refused to pay for the rent a couple of months last year. When my mom explains that she cannot cover the rent herself because she does not earn enough, he because EXTREMELY vile and abusive, and sometimes physically so. He calls her a leech (among other things), and asks her why she can't just go earn more. He also refuses to pay for anything else except for my brother's school tuition, but the rent is the biggest burden on my mom.

My mom thinks he is doing this to wipe out all of the money in her account, which would allow him to control her completely. She doesn't want to let go of it because it's all she has, and doesn't want to live with my dad after my brother graduates high school (also we don't know if he's going to pay for my brother's college. I'm a PhD student so I don't make nearly enough to support anyone).

In January of this year, my dad agreed to pay the 80% of the rent. He did so until March, and has not paid rent since. My mom only found out about this a couple of days ago from our landlord. She confronted him about this, but he again became abusive. The lease in solely in my mom's name. She has paid the rent for April, May, and June, but the money in her account is starting to drop very fast.

My dad is very weird about money. He's always trying some pseudo get-rich-quick scheme like property flipping or options trading, but he's lost a lot of money on these ventures because he has no idea what he's doing. When he gets stressed about money, he becomes abusive. He is also an alcoholic, and becomes more abusive when he's drunk. My mom is very afraid of my dad, especially when he's angry and **especially** when he's drunk. My 14 year-old brother once had to push my dad away from my mom when he was drunk and abusing her physically. She spends most of the time at home locked in her room, and this is exacerbated by the current lockdown.

My mom is reluctant to call the cops on him because she thinks it will negatively affect my brother's life, and she thinks keeping the family unit together even if only in name is worth the trauma. We are also reluctant to call the cops on him because my mom does not make enough money to afford to pay for an apartment and my brother's tuition, and still have enough money to send him to college. My aforementioned uncle is semi-wealthy and has been very generous with lending us money when we've needed it in the past, so I'm sure he will at least help, but my mom doesn't want to burden him. My uncle is the only other family we have in Singapore because we are originally from India.

I'm not sure how much evidence we have against him. I (and hopefully my brother) will vehemently testify against him about the abuse, and so will my uncle. My mother probably has chat logs of abuse on Whatsapp. I've asked her to download a voice recording app, and start recording when she thinks he is going to get abusive. I have screenshots of some of his browsing history, which is not great viewing but probably not illegal. He also tried to cheat on my mom in the past with someone from Canada (probably a catfish), and some of our extended family know about that. We have a lot of testimony against him, but not much concrete evidence of the abuse.",domesticviolence
Are there any success stories from staying with someone who hurt you? Has anyone hurt their partner and changed?,[deleted],domesticviolence
I left today,"Perhaps the least emotionally charged exchange we have ever shared between the two of us. For nearly two years now I have been buried beneath the insecurity and jealousy that had consumed me after my boyfriend had beat me outdoors in broad daylight. I’ve been on here a handful of times looking for strength and support only to wake up the next morning and call him myself. 

The jealousy comes from knowing that in his previous relationship he had never laid a hand on her. I would consistently pry as you why he was able to hurt me but not his ex. I feel like an evil person almost wishing that it had been something all his exes were exposed to, but deep down if there is any clarity or sense left in my brain I am thankful that harm never came to her - it just makes me feel as if there is something I had done to deserve it. 

I’ve left him tonight. Not because he had hurt me again but because as time continued I noticed that I became more resentful that he was now treating me kindly with respect and tenderness AFTER completely burning all of the bridges from him to my family/friends and hurting me. We had decided upon the last incident of physical abuse that he would no longer drink because he had been aggressive with me whenever he was drunk. Sometimes I lay at night and question what is compelling me to stay with a man who I would not be able to trust under the influence of alcohol, that I am fearful to drink with because I am doing all in my power to avoid a chokehold at the end of the night. 

I’ve been surrounded by my friends tonight. They have been talking to me on the phone up until I was convinced that I am tired - but once I am alone the flood of loneliness and desperation has began to sit in. But this time I hope to be better and smarter, and to instead share where I am at tonight here with a community who may also understand what I am going through. Today is day 1 without him.",domesticviolence
Not sure what to do,"I am trying to leave husband of 14 years. Marriage is religious and not civil. So I can’t take him to court for spousal support. He has made it clear that he no longer wants me around. He’s also gotten a new fiancé. He made me leave this past weekend because she and her father came to visit. He hid all my clothes, items, etc. to basically hide my existence. When I came back home, I discovered my clothes and items were in boxes and trash bags.

I only have a part time job. I’m trying to find some type of rental assistance so I can move. When I came home from work last night, I saw all the boxes in my room. They weren’t even neatly placed. He told me before I have two months to move (that’s when the lease ends). I yelled because I asked him earlier in the day if he could put my stuff back where he found it. Yet he just put all my stuff in the boxes in the middle of the room. We got into an argument and in the middle of it, he gets in my face and yells “do you want me to hit you?” I think it was the adrenaline because I said “do it and I’ll call my family and 911.” This doesn’t even make sense because my family is on the other side of the country. Yet it was the only thing I could think of. He then got his phone to record me. I said “my husband just threatened to hit me and I told him I’ll call 911 if he does.” He stopped recording after that. Eventually, I just started sobbing and it hit me that my husband threatened to hit me. I told him and he blamed me. He said I was blocking him (I honestly don’t remember doing that but he can easily push me aside if I was) and that I had spittle coming out of my mouth. I’m pretty sure he’s trying to make me seem crazy to his fiancé. He called her after. 

I don’t feel safe yet I feel I’m blowing this out of proportion. I wanted to leave but thought “there’s no where to go.” I went back to my room to try to sleep. I feel exhausted. I’m not sure what to do. I don’t want to talk to my family or friends about this. Like I don’t want anyone to overreact. I guess I just needed to talk to someone, even strangers on the Internet about this. Thanks for listening (reading) is you made it this far.",domesticviolence

Narcissism or legit sociopath?,"Looking back on the stories I’ve been through...I’m wondering if it’s possible my ex has more going on than just NPD. Could he be an actual sociopath? Idk...

Here’s some examples:

He brought me to a bank and had me sign a paper with a legit notary “promising to give away my unborn child”. This was against my will. The only reason I did it was so he’d give me a ride to the airport so I could leave his ass. He Harassed me all summer to give away the baby before I “corrupted it” (while I was still pregnant) THEN he tried to use this notarized paper against me in a custody dispute. Claiming to be dad of the year. (Now he’s an absent parent)

Here’s another fun one. He got me intoxicated, allowed his friend to sexually assault me. Convinced me I’d consented to it. And then a year later allowed the same friend to MOVE INTO OUR FUCKING HOUSE against my consent. And literally made me feel GUILTY because I understandably didn’t want his friend living there.... Then in front of me and this friend, he commented that he would be ok with allowing other men to have sex with me as long as he was in the room.  Like what the actual f^%%

One last one: He got me to drop out of nursing school, so I’d be able to move away with him. So I did what he said. Once we moved away I switched majors. He proceeded to try and tell me that I was a failure for dropping out of nursing school. And that my new major was worthless and I should’ve asked permission first. 




I think my ex is actually a legit sociopath. Not just NPD but like....complete psycho.",domesticviolence

Hey everyone,

For starters, this is a throwaway account for obvious reasons, but I'm wanting to ask the internet for some serious advice that my family may not be able to come up with ourselves.

My brother (38), who lives with my dad (74), has not physically harmed my dad yet, but the possibility keeps increasing with time. What he has done though, is caused a tremendous amount of psychological stress and financial damage.

I want my dad to stop living in fear. His life honestly is not good right now, and it could be if my brother weren't in the picture. I ask for any advice in which my family can use to remove my brother from our lives, or at the very least, my dad's house.

I unfortunately live about an hour half from my dad, and my other brother lives about 30 min, but still it's too far in case there's an emergency. My dad sorta makes matters worse by protecting my brother and covering for him sometimes. He just wants peace and nothing else so he tries to sit on the fence and pretend things are fine, but other times he admits he wishes he was gone.

# Summary:

My brother has had consistent drug and/or mental relapses, which include several physical assaults, verbal assaults, years of jail time, and even death threats against my dad. He shows no signs or ability to reason with anyone or anything, and recently his mental state has decayed so much I don't even consider him a functional adult any longer. He's been basically unemployed for about 10 or more years now living off my dad's income.  He's basically just a hollow shell that nobody wants to be around in fear that something might trigger him. He's potentially very dangerous and at his best, he's still an enormous financial strain and source of stress.

He's had a very up-and-down life since he was 16. He's always been a pretty big troublemaker, but around 18 he was prescribed painkillers (Vicodin) for an injury he sustained. This led him down a never ending road of substance abuse. He was a functional adult back then, but just had an addiction that we all felt he could get past. The entire family was always supportive of him getting clean, but his recoveries always led to a relapse. Each time we all kept encouraging him to get better, and to try again. We were very sympathetic for him. We truly were on his side.

Unfortunately his life never had any stability in it. We believe he's gotten to a point now that he will never change. Sadly his mind just seems to be gone now from all the drugs he's done (he's admitted to mixing pills, using heroine, and a litany of methods to get high that I never heard of. There's nothing left of him that resemble the ""good"" parts of him. Now days he rambles about religion 24/7 as he's become a fanatic, and complains no one loves Jesus as much as he does and how everyone is a fake christian (even entire churches), he confuses being high with feeling the holy spirit etc. Just very unusual behavior all the time that it's just his new normal. Basically he's so unhinged lately, that he's become even more unpredictable, and that scares us.

Nobody really knows for sure if my brother has a mental disorder, has fried his brain, or is just constantly under the influence. My brother never shares doctor information, and the doctors he claims he goes to all sound fake/sketchy so I don't know the validity of anything he tells us. It doesn't help that my dad obfuscates details in his older age a lot more than he used to so we're going to only work with the information I can confirm from my own experiences or through my other brother.

There's so many incidents he's caused, I don't think I can confidently recall them all so I'll just categorize each type of incident and list the most memorable and you can read or skip ahead as you please.

&amp;#x200B;

# Car accidents:

I think he's wrecked about 6 vehicles? Maybe more? A few were ""his"" that my dad bought him, and the rest were my parents' personal vehicles. Amazingly, he hasn't harmed or killed anyone in any of his car accidents, mainly because he doesn't make it very far from his origin and crashes all by himself due to being so inebriated. All vehicles were totaled.

He's wrapped a truck around a mailbox while drunk driving.

* Flipped my mom's Trailblazer after jumping a driveway culvert and landing on a neighbors fence.
* Flipped my mom's Suburban after going into a ditch off the side of the road.
* Yelled at my mom from the passenger seat, where she became so stressed out and accidentally drove her car through their brick garage wall (everyone was okay).
* Caused a 3+ car pile up at a traffic light where he failed to stop. He got injured pretty good, but nothing serious.

His most recent wreck (early this year) and the biggest aftermath, was right after he quit his job of one week and claimed Jesus told him to ""turn the wheel right"" while on the highway. He swerved into the right-side guardrail until coming to a stop where a good Samaritan stopped to assist. My brother then attacks the man until police show up and he attacks the officer as well. It was later discovered he had shoplifted a bunch of clothes. He was arrested obviously. He was in jail for about a month, but eventually was released and showed up back at my dad's.

One of my biggest concerns here is not himself, but the safety of other drivers on the road. I fear he will get someone killed eventually. Nobody feels like they can simply take keys away from him, either. My dad begs to keep peace, and I fear he will take his anger out on my dad in a physical way when no one is there to step in. It seems like we lose any decision we make.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# Financial Burdens:

Before my mom passed away in 2016, she for the most part, kept my brother in check with her motherly presence. Since then though, my brother has only gotten worse. He was always more tolerable with my mom, but now that he directly has to deal with my dad more often, he is a lot more aggressive.

My dad is too ...nice, afraid, guilty...whatever you want to call it to simply evict my brother. Everyone knows that if he were to kick him out, his reaction would be unpredictable. Ranging anywhere from my brother getting himself killed in a car accident, overdose, violent encounter with someone, or my brother would simply not comply and remain in the house and use physical force if he had to. All of these possibilities make it hard for my dad to make a decision on what to do. Here's some facts about my brother regarding financial burdens:

* He can't hold a job. He occasionally gets a decent job but will blow it in about a month and blames the employer. I can't keep track of how many times he's been fired. He hardly looks for work, and will only consider work positions that aren't beneath him, thus he rarely gets hired anywhere. Over the last decade, he's mostly spent his time sitting at home or fishing with the use of my dad and his (now former) girlfriend's money.
* He was looking to buy a car, but when the salesman ""offended"" him, he pretended to be a bigshot and took his business across the street and literally bought a \~$70k truck that he 9000% can't afford. Somehow my dad ended up making the $700 dollar payments for him. (this is the truck that is now totaled after ""Jesus"" told him to crash it).
* He is currently a patient of a methadone clinic, and I don't know the details but I'm to understand it's not cheap.
* He receives money from my dad to go buy chewing tobacco whenever he runs out
* Just today I found out my brother stole my dad's credit card, stole my dad's car, bought himself a new phone, venmo'd himself $500 and for some reason called 911 and told the dispatcher my dad was having a heart attack and was showing signs of dementia (He wasn't and he isn't). Luckily the paramedics didn't fine my dad or anything.
* He eats a huge amount of food and it's causing my dad to have to grocery shop more often to keep the kitchen stocked.
* He generally breaks household items on accident a lot and my dad has to replace them.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# Acts of aggression:

All of these acts of aggression are him being under the influence of ""something"". When he's sober, he's typically a normal person. He comes across like a tough guy still, but generally doesn't act nearly a irrational. He doesn't drink since his teenage days really, so we can only assume he is mixing pills. When he's ""high"" he just becomes very dopey in behavior. His voice becomes lower, slower and his eyes look sleepy. However, he is at his most sensitive in this stage and feels like everyone is constantly judging him, but he reacts with aggression, mostly getting in peoples faces, spitting, headbutting, yelling etc.

I just want to be clear that nobody provokes him ever. He is 100% the bully in all situations. Every case is the same where he will take offense to something as minor as disagreeing with him on what temperature to set the oven, or telling him to give you a little space while he speaks, because he's getting spit on your face.

It'd be impossible to list every time he's verbally abused someone or made some threats, but some notable events are:

* Received a phone call in 2013 from my mom saying she and my dad were locked in their bedroom and he was trying to break the door down to get to them.
* Headbutt me sometime around 2012 to make me fight him when I was angry with him for being high and incoherently rambling to me.
* Several instances with my other brother where they got into fist-fights because he was acting belligerent and insulting my mom, and he didn't appreciate being confronted.
* Ex-friend of my brother confided this year that my brother told him he would kill my dad if my dad did not keep paying my brothers truck payments.
* I already mentioned he recently attacked a good Samaritan and police officer this year.
* Not an aggressive act, but several times he's gone schizophrenic and claimed crazy things like our nephews were inside his washing machine and sobbing that he couldn't get them out. This particular incident was around 2008 or 2009 and we later found out he mixed his methadone with other pills that caused him to hallucinate.

When he's not being hotheaded and looking to start a fight with someone, he generally is so doped out that he could pass out and fall asleep in the middle of the kitchen floor or just sleeping in his room. When he sleeps is when everyone can escape the insanity for a little bit.

&amp;#x200B;

# Conclusion:

I know some responses will be tempted to provide drug addiction help, but please try to keep in mind my family's priority is to keep my dad safe first. If my brother can be helped, then that's great, but we've all given him literally every chance to redeem himself, get help, etc  and I don't want my dad to live with him another minute if possible. He has proven time after time that he does not want any help. He is overflowing with confidence and actually thinks very highly of himself. He's convinced himself that he is superior in every way and any misfortune he's had is just the world pushing down good people.

We keep hoping he'll get arrested again and go away for an actual long time, but somehow the longest he's ever stayed in jail was a little over a year. He's a good faker when he knows he needs to be, so he knows how to fool people into thinking he's ""functional"" enough. First impression of him from the perspective of a complete stranger, and you'd just think he's a really strange guy who seems kinda toxic, but doesn't technically cross any lines.

This has been the most frustrating part. What he's doing should be illegal, but the police don't seem to care that an abusive family member can intimidate his way into being a lifelong leech on his own father. Please, please let us know if there's some program or anything out there that can help us out.

Thank you so much for reading this wall of text.",domesticviolence
What do you do to find catharsis of the abuse?,"I can't speak up to ever voice my own opinion to him. I can't throw and break things, like he does. I can't really talk to anyone, unless I delete the evidence I was venting. I absolutely can't do anything with a hint of something being wrong, otherwise it will be punishment. I try to listen to music that speaks to me, talk to friends (whenever it's in my possibility) and vape THC oil. What do you do that helps? There's no judgement here.

I left and now they're trying to contact me.,"I had a previous post explaining why I left ( [https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/gwv22q/am\_i\_at\_risk\_here\_or\_just\_overreacting\_long/](https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/gwv22q/am_i_at_risk_here_or_just_overreacting_long/)  )

To summarise, my housemate ('Alex') was escalating their behaviour of hitting, throwing stuff at me, and aggressive behaviour.

I moved out on Monday, and my housemate only caught me during my second trip and Alex asked if we could have a 'chat' and I said no.

I've since been told that Alex 'would like it if I contacted them directly as Alex would like to be able to discuss and resolve any problems which have occurred within your friendship' by a mutual friend (who doesn't know the details of the abuse).

Do I message Alex?

I was thinking along the lines of 'I understand you probably want an explanation as to why I moved out. Your behaviour when you are upset (I have personally witnessed/been on the receiving end of verbal abuse, throwing things, hitting, slapping, screaming, and more) is abusive and terrifying. When you confronted me with an issue you had out of the blue, you made me fear for my safety. I could not confront you, because it was not safe to. I left because I need to be safe. When you need to contact me about bills, post, etc, please go through \[landlord\]'",domesticviolence

Advice for outside observer,"My neighbor screams at his wife for 30 minutes at a time, like full bore top of his lungs screaming, maximum energy.

Grandmother being Abused by son,"Hey,

first of all this is a throwaway for obvious reasons.

Since my Grandfather died
my Grandmother is being mentaly and physically abused by my uncle (her son).
She is currently staying at my house but wants to go back home because she misses home (I life about 1,5h away).
Her son has an apartment on his own but comes by her house regularly. He will threaten her and tell her shes worthless etc. And also hit her and push her around. Then wants my grandma to say sorry to him for making him angry.
My Grandmother defends him and says that he isn’t always like that. She just loves him too much to kick him out. 

Is there anyway I can help her ? I have been supporting her no matter what but she just seems to not recognise that shes being abused, since it has been increasing over time

I would be so grateful for anyone giving advice and feel free to ask questions on detail.",domesticviolence
What if?,"Throwaway acct. I’m in the middle of a shitshow with my soon to be ex husband who beat me back in late Nov. I didn’t file a police report initially or report him (he’s active mil), but did get treated and injuries documented at the ER the day after it happened. 

The situation has been strange, he’s taken on a pattern of being verbally/financially/emotionally abusive now. 

Days ago I filed the police report and gave them all supporting documentation/photos/evidence. Unfortunately the detectives in Victim Advocacy at the substation I went to have a 30 day processing period before it’s even considered for prosecution by the DA—IF it even gets that far, due to the length of time that’s passed (approx 6 months).

I also filed for divorce but due to COVID, it’s taking more time for petitions to be filed and served. I filed back in Dec, but put  it on hold because I was a dumbass and thought counseling would help. 

One thing I’m curious about. My husband has a child from a previous marriage and another from a relationship between marriages where it was “one shot one kill.” He has unofficial primary custody of the child from his first marriage (mom didn’t want to mom so they reversed their possession periods and she sent her to live w/us during the school year). Their divorce decree was never changed to reflect this. Just a notarized letter. 

The child between marriages—he had no relationship with him and wasn’t present for the birth or for the first few years (he’s 3 and I just found out my husband met him for the first time last weekend—must be guilt). 

With our youngest, shared child, I fully intend to go to blows with him over this as he’s mentioned he doesn’t care if he goes broke doing so, he’d fight me for primary custody. If it doesn’t work in his favor, will it surface that he’s got domestic abuser status and will the court (or whomever) notify the other mothers? I’m sorry if it’s a stupid question and if it’s been asked before. Thanks in advance.",domesticviolence

my best friend is being abused,"the title says it all. my best friend (19 f) is being abused, both physically and mentally by her boyfriend, and i don’t know what to do or how to help her. she hasn’t been responding to my texts, which is normal she takes a long time to reply sometimes but this time something felt off. i get a bunch of IG dms from her today explaining her dad took away her phone and keys because her neighbor told her dad about her and her boyfriend. i assume he sees them sneaking in and out and smoking weed outside. she told me she’s depressed and being abused and that she has bruises and cuts all over body from both being hurt from her boyfriend and trying to harm herself as well. her jaw is messed up and her tooth is chipped too. she told me he keeps getting mad at her for little things and they just end up in a screaming match and denies that the marks on her body are from him and only from her. but they’re not obviously. he’s really bipolar and unstable in my opinion and this has been ongoing. he also makes her have sex when she’s not in the mood and then gets mad when she doesn’t want to do things. she’s even having troubling remembering things because it’s happening so often and she can’t recall everything to tell me. i’ve known about the verbal abuse but i think this is the first time she’s confided in me about the physical abuse. i’m so mad writing this and i was so mad reading her messages because he’s the biggest piece of shit i’ve ever met. he’s nice in person but it’s all an act. she said there’s so much she’s never told me and i’m just really worried about her. she’s really close with her sister but i don’t know if she’s telling her any of this. i think she’s texting me from a laptop or an ipad or something because she currently doesn’t have her phone and she’s just messaging me when she gets a chance to. i just don’t know how i can support her when i can’t see her or be with her and i want that piece of shit out of her life. he’s ruining her. please someone help me.",domesticviolence
"I’m confused, alone and afraid.","I’m currently in a relationship and we’ve been going for 5 years. This is my first and only boyfriend in my 25 years of life. In the beginning everything was beautiful and I felt so loved but then things changed. A year and a half into the relationship I found out my bf would masturbate to pictures of his girl best friends and even to pictures of his sister in laws. I asked him to stop since he was so close to them and even asked him to stop hanging out with them if he saw them in any way other then as friends. He told me he felt nothing for them and what he was doing was normal and had no emotional connection. He said he didn’t even want to have real sex with them. I began to get jealous and insecure so I would check his phone often and realized he continued to do it. I didn’t leave him because that was my first bf and felt like I loved him. One day he got annoyed that I kept asking him to unfriend them on social media and screamed at me saying “you get your feelings hurt because you want to. I’m going to keep doing this and it’s your fault if your feelings get hurt.” I should’ve taken that as a sign and left. 

As time went by my jealousy would get worse and my confidence levels no longer existed. I became so needy to the point where I would ask what he was doing all the time and he got fed up and slapped me. Again, I didn’t take that as a sign cause I loved him. 

In November 2018 my mom kicked me out of the house because I got into an argument with one of her sisters. Of course she took their side and I was out on the streets. I lived in my car for a few days since I have no other family and occasionally my bf would sneak me into his house. I had a job but I had just started so I didn’t have money for my own place. His mom let me stay there for the remainder of the year until I was able to find my own please. I ended up getting pregnant and I told him about it...his reaction was to get mad, slap me, grab me by the hair and tell me I was stupid for not taking care of myself. He said he was too young to end his life and he didn’t want anything of it. 

January 2nd 2019 he forced me to get an abortion. I was afraid to live on the streets again and had nowhere to go so I remained in his house. I said I wasn’t going to get an abortion and that I could keep the baby and take care of it myself and he wouldn’t have to worry about it. He continued to beat me and said if I didn’t go thru with the abortion he’d beat it out of me. I passed out in the waiting room of the abortion clinic because I was so scared and didn’t want to go through with it. One of the nurses took me to the back and gave me some Coca Cola to help my blood pressure levels. I remember crying so much and not being able to tell her why. When I heard the little heart beat I couldn’t contain myself yet I was so afraid. I was 8 weeks. The 2nd visit I had to speak to a counselor before the procedure and I was hoping she’d ask me if it was my choice and if I really wanted to go through with it. I wanted to hear her say that if it was against my will she could help. She didn’t. Instead she explained the procedure and showed me how it would work with a little model on her desk. I was so afraid about many things yet I did nothing about it. I was sedated via an IV and given Valium. I remember waking up crying so much because I knew it was over and my baby was gone. I was heavily sedated but I remember feeling my shirt was drenched in tears and the nurse had to walk me out to the car where my bf was waiting. She told him I was heavily sedated and that I wouldn’t stop crying. She said he had to make sure I ate and comfort me. I cried the whole way home and pretty much the whole day. I hated myself and still do. Till this day I hate myself more than him because I didn’t do anything to stop this. I was alone and couldn’t tell anyone other then him what was happening to me. I had no place to go other than his house. 

As time went by things changed. He became nicer, the beatings stop for a little bit until he moved in with me to my new place. When we get into serious arguments he tends to pull my hair or push me or punch me in the face. I’ve wanted to report him to the cops several times but he never leaves any signs. He’s also verbally abusive and emotionally. I’ve never bled, he hasn’t left any noticeable bruises and he’s never pulled hair out of my head to show as evidence. I feel like if I say anything they won’t believe me and it will make things worse when he comes back home. 

I also looked up domestic violence signs and I’m afraid they’ll charge me for domestic violence since I would check his phone without permission and invade his privacy in social media. I don’t want to go to jail. I never called him names and never laid a hand on him not even in self defense. 

I’m sorry this post is so long but I just had to vent. Can anyone help me or guide me? Please don’t be harsh with me in regards to the abortion or all the things I’m allowing him to do. I already hate myself enough and I’m just afraid since I have no one else but him.",domesticviolence
Husband of 4 years arrested today after holding me down and choking me,"Not the first time of him choking me but will be the last.
My husband of 4 years has lied to me from day one of marriage. He is a drug addict and never disclosed this information to me until after we were married. 
He was clean after we got married for about 10 months, then has relapsed on and off for 3 years.
Today was horrible all I saw was murder in his eyes all while him yelling at me that if I just listened for once and shut up we could talk and move on.
It’s been 4 years of mental, emotional and financial abuse. 
All while he makes/made me feel like if I just did better he would too.
I realize now his problems are not my problem or my fault.

Am I victimizing myself or was this intentional?,"I (26f) ended a 7 month relationship with my boyfriend (21m) a month and a half ago. He had always expressed to me how bad his anger used to be and how it's under control now. I never saw anything overly aggressive apart from some trust and control issues that weren't huge. 

When Covid began, we quarantined together and were working out in his workshop daily. We began to argue a bit as it was too much at once to be with each other 24/7. One night at the gym/shop, he was joking around and choked me but he grabbed me extremely hard and I instantly panicked because my vision went and I couldn't breathe. I finally got him to let go and I noticed that I felt out of body, my eyes were hurting, head hurting, etc. He just walked away back to his workout. I made it clear I wasn't mad but that I was in pain so I decided to sit out of the workout in fear of passing out. He then got angry and told me we had to leave, he got very quiet in car and asked me if I needed to go the hospital but with such a cold tone in his voice. I said no and we came home. He continued to be very annoyed with me and when I asked what was going on he said that ""it's always something that ruins his workout and when he can't workout he gets angry"". I felt very sad that this happened and I did not want him to cut his workout short and I was not angry. 

A week goes by and the fights got worse and I couldn't deal with it anymore. The night before we ended things, we got into a fight that really was silly but he got very angry. So much so that he went extremely red and got scary. He was screaming at me to ""come here"" because I wouldn't come near him. He went outside and punched the door in and was screaming. 

I hadn't seen him like what before and it was really scary. Things have ended and we haven't talked in about a month but I am finding myself caught up on the choking, I am thinking about it a lot, having nightmares about it... Worried that he was angry at himself for this happening again to him (I'm assuming here but maybe it's happened before?) 

I am unsure if it was truly a mistake in which I am finding something small and victimizing myself or finding the one thing to cling to to help me get over him. Or, was it intentional? The uncertainty just has me questioning it a lot. Any advice?",domesticviolence
The police ignored my domestic violence complaint - what do I do?,"So I just called the police tonight - ironic given what's going on with the protests - because it sounded like a man was hitting a woman in the apartment stairwell, and children were crying the background. The police said they would investigate. 

The police just drove by twenty minutes later and left without even stopping. The couple had already gone inside, but I told them what floor it was on. I called the police department back and asked why they didn't knock on any doors or even come inside the apartment. The department said that the incident was marked as ""cleared"" with no report on what happened. But I know that they didn't do anything. I waited for an hour and no one came.

When the fighting started I was like, well fuck, this is why we need the police I guess. But then the police didn't do anything... Is this normal? Are they just feeling spiteful right now? What else do I do? I know this isn't about me, but I'm a survivor and I feel like I have to do something. :(",domesticviolence

Advice Needed: How do I help my mother in an abusive relationship when she won’t talk to me about it?,"After my parents divorce a few years ago my mom met her now husband. He forced her to move 13 hours away from us (2 kids, 1 grandkid) and I now have very little contact with her. I have seen her once in 3 years and she was covered in bruises and other family members tell me a little bit about the abuse she encounters. But I think she is ashamed to tell me (her daughter) how bad things truly are. When we seldomly talk she pretends her life is doing just fine, and even brags how much better her abuser is than my dad. I am heart broken for her and want to help but I don’t know how to address it with her without angering her and/or him and potentially putting her in danger or losing that relationship I have with her.",domesticviolence

Abusive coparent,"So I cannot have a conversation with my ex. Every time we talk - he insults me. I have been nothing but politically correct, keeping the conversation neutral. 

He calls me disgusting, manipulative, evil, awful. Yesterday he called me gross on 3 occasions because I attempted to put up a boundary. 

Does this reflect badly on him? Or can he just get away with this? Will a judge not care? It feels really unfair that he would just be able to call me names in every single interaction and not have any consequence. 

I then question why I can’t insult him back, you know? That would feel more fair. Right now he’s just walking all over me with insults. Coming and going as he pleases and beating my ego to a pulp. 

Example: “how are the kids doing? I wouldn’t expect you to give me any real information though, because you’re a piece of shit and awful person. But I’m wondering if they can talk on the phone?”

“Sure...what time”

“8pm. I won’t play your games. That’s when I’ll be calling. Don’t be typical and gross/manipulative and miss the call.”

Like I’m in tears every time he texts because I’ve never felt so hopeless. It feels really vulnerable not being able to defend myself. Or can I? Will a judge not care if I yell and scream at him and tell him to back off? I want to tell him to go $&amp;%^ himself the next time he insults me. I’m tired of ignoring it or just saying “ok”. I’m TIRED of letting him walk all over me!",domesticviolence

Younger sister in abusive relationship,"My first post on this thread. For some background I’m 30 and my younger sister is 21. 
We have been generally close but she’s very introverted and to herself. 
Today I got news she gave birth. I had no idea she was pregnant she hid it from everyone except our parents and I was in the dark. 
I was ecstatic and everything until I found out her bf has hit her and cops have been involved. 
This changed everything my joy went to fear. 

The thing is that she made it sound like everything was great it wasn’t until I spoke to my dad that he told me what has been happening. 

I’m so scared for her now but don’t want to tell her I know: I’ve been casually joking she move into my house but don’t know how to go about it.

Advice for my escape plan,"Hello everyone, throwaway obviously because my abuser stalks both my main and alt accounts.

After 5 years together, and 4+ years of dealing with physical, emotional, and financial abuse, I am done. I have made a plan to move in with my cousin. Her and my best friend are the only two who have any idea what is going on in my relationship. Our lease begins the first week of July, and my god am i ready for my freedom.

Funnily enough (in a very morbid way) after I came back from the hospital today so get a sling around my arm because he tore my shoulder muscle from slamming me to the ground the other day, I got the call. “I’ve made the deposit, we move in the first week of July” I cried right there on the sidewalk. After years of abuse I’m going to be free.

My escape plan however, needs the kinks worked out. Due to the current world situation, im currently unemployed and he is working from home. I planned to leave and take my animals (all registered under my name and my name alone) when he was gone, but i now have no idea when that will happen. He has random parts hanging around the house that he’s trying to sell, i was honestly considering hiring someone in the ny/nj area to buy the part off of him and offer extra for him to drive to ship it to them so i can make my escape while he is gone. I’ve also contacted my bank to remove myself as an authorized used on our shared cc. Also our lease was up last year and we have been paying month to month so no problems there as well.

I know there is so much more that I need to do before leaving but I just want to make sure I do everything I can to keep him from finding me because I legitimately think he’ll try to kill me when he finds out. My dad is still paying for my phone while im in college so my abuser has no access to the account. I plan to change my phone number as well and tell all my fanily not to respond to any of his attempts to contact them.

Another issue is that we also go to the same university, we are both set to graduate next year. But since I am going through with this I wouldn’t feel safe at my university and plan on taking the year off. Not only for safety, but I’m going to need some serious mental health guidance after this, my grades are already in the toilet because of it so I need a break.

Other than the shared card, there’s no other money I owe him or have tied up with him anywhere.

Any advice or guidence through this time would be extremely helpful, I’ve never had to do anything like this in my life and I’m trying to do my best to protect myself and my animals. Thank you for listening.",domesticviolence
Dad is threatening my Mom if she doesn't transfer all her money to him today,"Hi,

I will first provide information about the urgent situation, and provide background information further down in the post.

I currently live in the US. My dad and mom live in Singapore with my younger brother who is in high school. My Dad has been abusive towards my mother for a long time; mostly emotionally and verbally, but has recently been physically abusive as well. My dad recently sold our house in Singapore, and put half the money from the sale into my mom's account, and my family has moved apartments a few times since.

Today he sent her a message saying that she had to transfer all the money to his account by the end of the day, and to send him her bank statements since Jan 2020. There was no explicit threat, but it is strongly implied by the history of abuse. My mom has reached out to a counsellor, who said that she needs to come in to the office in person to register for a case worker. My mom is afraid that if my dad finds out she's reached out to a counsellor, he will get violent. She is currently working from home, so is locked in her room and cannot leave until evening, after work, which is after the counsellor's office closes. We're afraid of what might happen at the end of the day if she's still at home and hasn't transferred the money (which she doesn't want to do for reasons explained below). She has reached out to the counsellor about the situation, but has not yet received a response.

She can go to my uncle's (mom's brother) house, which is where she's gone when things have gotten bad in the past. But she usually views this as a last-resort option as she doesn't like to burden her brother. She also doesn't usually leave the house during the day, so if she checks out of work and leaves to go to the counsellor's office, my dad will know something is up, and my mom doesn't like to leave my brother alone with him when he's angry.

What is the best course of action here? I understand that the laws in Singapore may be different from the laws in the US or wherever you're from, but any advice or insight is appreciated. I personally have no idea what to tell her, and feel guilty that I don't know what to do.

P.S. I have crossposted this to other subs. Please let me know if there is anywhere else I can post this to get some advice

\------

In the current apartment, my mom's monthly salary is equal to the monthly rent. My dad makes 4 times what my mom does (because she took many years off work to raise my brother and me, and is now above the age of 50). My dad refused to pay for the rent a couple of months last year. When my mom explains that she cannot cover the rent herself because she does not earn enough, he because EXTREMELY vile and abusive, and sometimes physically so. He calls her a leech (among other things), and asks her why she can't just go earn more. He also refuses to pay for anything else except for my brother's school tuition, but the rent is the biggest burden on my mom.

My mom thinks he is doing this to wipe out all of the money in her account, which would allow him to control her completely. She doesn't want to let go of it because it's all she has, and doesn't want to live with my dad after my brother graduates high school (also we don't know if he's going to pay for my brother's college. I'm a PhD student so I don't make nearly enough to support anyone).

In January of this year, my dad agreed to pay the 80% of the rent. He did so until March, and has not paid rent since. My mom only found out about this a couple of days ago from our landlord. She confronted him about this, but he again became abusive. The lease in solely in my mom's name. She has paid the rent for April, May, and June, but the money in her account is starting to drop very fast.

My dad is very weird about money. He's always trying some pseudo get-rich-quick scheme like property flipping or options trading, but he's lost a lot of money on these ventures because he has no idea what he's doing. When he gets stressed about money, he becomes abusive. He is also an alcoholic, and becomes more abusive when he's drunk. My mom is very afraid of my dad, especially when he's angry and **especially** when he's drunk. My 14 year-old brother once had to push my dad away from my mom when he was drunk and abusing her physically. She spends most of the time at home locked in her room, and this is exacerbated by the current lockdown.

My mom is reluctant to call the cops on him because she thinks it will negatively affect my brother's life, and she thinks keeping the family unit together even if only in name is worth the trauma. We are also reluctant to call the cops on him because my mom does not make enough money to afford to pay for an apartment and my brother's tuition, and still have enough money to send him to college. My aforementioned uncle is semi-wealthy and has been very generous with lending us money when we've needed it in the past, so I'm sure he will at least help, but my mom doesn't want to burden him. My uncle is the only other family we have in Singapore because we are originally from India.

I'm not sure how much evidence we have against him. I (and hopefully my brother) will vehemently testify against him about the abuse, and so will my uncle. My mother probably has chat logs of abuse on Whatsapp. I've asked her to download a voice recording app, and start recording when she thinks he is going to get abusive. I have screenshots of some of his browsing history, which is not great viewing but probably not illegal. He also tried to cheat on my mom in the past with someone from Canada (probably a catfish), and some of our extended family know about that. We have a lot of testimony against him, but not much concrete evidence of the abuse.",domesticviolence
Are there any success stories from staying with someone who hurt you? Has anyone hurt their partner and changed?,[deleted],domesticviolence
I left today,"Perhaps the least emotionally charged exchange we have ever shared between the two of us. For nearly two years now I have been buried beneath the insecurity and jealousy that had consumed me after my boyfriend had beat me outdoors in broad daylight. I’ve been on here a handful of times looking for strength and support only to wake up the next morning and call him myself. 

The jealousy comes from knowing that in his previous relationship he had never laid a hand on her. I would consistently pry as you why he was able to hurt me but not his ex. I feel like an evil person almost wishing that it had been something all his exes were exposed to, but deep down if there is any clarity or sense left in my brain I am thankful that harm never came to her - it just makes me feel as if there is something I had done to deserve it. 

I’ve left him tonight. Not because he had hurt me again but because as time continued I noticed that I became more resentful that he was now treating me kindly with respect and tenderness AFTER completely burning all of the bridges from him to my family/friends and hurting me. We had decided upon the last incident of physical abuse that he would no longer drink because he had been aggressive with me whenever he was drunk. Sometimes I lay at night and question what is compelling me to stay with a man who I would not be able to trust under the influence of alcohol, that I am fearful to drink with because I am doing all in my power to avoid a chokehold at the end of the night. 

I’ve been surrounded by my friends tonight. They have been talking to me on the phone up until I was convinced that I am tired - but once I am alone the flood of loneliness and desperation has began to sit in. But this time I hope to be better and smarter, and to instead share where I am at tonight here with a community who may also understand what I am going through. Today is day 1 without him.",domesticviolence
Not sure what to do,"I am trying to leave husband of 14 years. Marriage is religious and not civil. So I can’t take him to court for spousal support. He has made it clear that he no longer wants me around. He’s also gotten a new fiancé. He made me leave this past weekend because she and her father came to visit. He hid all my clothes, items, etc. to basically hide my existence. When I came back home, I discovered my clothes and items were in boxes and trash bags.

I only have a part time job. I’m trying to find some type of rental assistance so I can move. When I came home from work last night, I saw all the boxes in my room. They weren’t even neatly placed. He told me before I have two months to move (that’s when the lease ends). I yelled because I asked him earlier in the day if he could put my stuff back where he found it. Yet he just put all my stuff in the boxes in the middle of the room. We got into an argument and in the middle of it, he gets in my face and yells “do you want me to hit you?” I think it was the adrenaline because I said “do it and I’ll call my family and 911.” This doesn’t even make sense because my family is on the other side of the country. Yet it was the only thing I could think of. He then got his phone to record me. I said “my husband just threatened to hit me and I told him I’ll call 911 if he does.” He stopped recording after that. Eventually, I just started sobbing and it hit me that my husband threatened to hit me. I told him and he blamed me. He said I was blocking him (I honestly don’t remember doing that but he can easily push me aside if I was) and that I had spittle coming out of my mouth. I’m pretty sure he’s trying to make me seem crazy to his fiancé. He called her after. 

I don’t feel safe yet I feel I’m blowing this out of proportion. I wanted to leave but thought “there’s no where to go.” I went back to my room to try to sleep. I feel exhausted. I’m not sure what to do. I don’t want to talk to my family or friends about this. Like I don’t want anyone to overreact. I guess I just needed to talk to someone, even strangers on the Internet about this. Thanks for listening (reading) is you made it this far.",domesticviolence

Narcissism or legit sociopath?,"Looking back on the stories I’ve been through...I’m wondering if it’s possible my ex has more going on than just NPD. Could he be an actual sociopath? Idk...

Here’s some examples:

He brought me to a bank and had me sign a paper with a legit notary “promising to give away my unborn child”. This was against my will. The only reason I did it was so he’d give me a ride to the airport so I could leave his ass. He Harassed me all summer to give away the baby before I “corrupted it” (while I was still pregnant) THEN he tried to use this notarized paper against me in a custody dispute. Claiming to be dad of the year. (Now he’s an absent parent)

Here’s another fun one. He got me intoxicated, allowed his friend to sexually assault me. Convinced me I’d consented to it. And then a year later allowed the same friend to MOVE INTO OUR FUCKING HOUSE against my consent. And literally made me feel GUILTY because I understandably didn’t want his friend living there.... Then in front of me and this friend, he commented that he would be ok with allowing other men to have sex with me as long as he was in the room.  Like what the actual f^%%

One last one: He got me to drop out of nursing school, so I’d be able to move away with him. So I did what he said. Once we moved away I switched majors. He proceeded to try and tell me that I was a failure for dropping out of nursing school. And that my new major was worthless and I should’ve asked permission first. 




I think my ex is actually a legit sociopath. Not just NPD but like....complete psycho.",domesticviolence

"My boyfriend hit me, I know I should leave, what’s stopping me?","My boyfriend has a temper, he gets in a mood where he gets mad often and then he will start casually calling me a bitch and making passive aggressive comments. Two years ago he stole my phone out of my hands to read what I was saying to my friend. I was talking to her because he’d said he hates my voice and my face, I’m annoying and he wants me to go away. He also threw me on the floor that time. 

About a year ago we had a fight in the restaurant we worked at and he called me a fucking bitch shouted go fuck yourself in front of everyone and stormed out. We didn’t speak for three months and he was angry all that time. Eventually I’d left my bag in the restaurant overnight and he came in one morning screaming about how much he hates me and dumped my stuff into the toilet. 

After that he sincerely apologised for being so crazy and we became friends. After many months we got back together, now we are living together with his dad in the country because our restaurant closed down and we lost our jobs. Yesterday he got angry and I tried to get him to talk to me, he kneed me in the face threw me on the ground and punched me. I said I’m definitely leaving and organised my friend to come and get me when it’s the right time. 

Then he talked to me about it, at first he said it was my fault, id wanted him to hit me and taunted him. I said that’s not what happened and eventually he was sorry and said he would not do it again. But when I asked him what he would do instead or how he was going to work on it he got angry again and said I should work on my social issues like “not knowing when to shut up”. I said I need time to get over it and later on decided to make the peace. 

I KNOW that literally everything in this situation points to that I should leave because he’s going to do it again, he blames me for it and thinks I deserve it, and isn’t going to even try to change. I am basically ready to go and can call my friend at any time. But I can’t bring myself to. Does anyone know what’s going on? Do I want to stay? Has anyone else felt like this?

TLDR; boyfriends temper got out of control and he got violent for the third time in our relationship, he’s not sorry and I know I should leave but can’t bring myself to, help.",domesticviolence
tips for organizing 3 years of documented abuse for DVCPO hearing,"I need help and I can't imagine I'm the only one who's ever found the documentation process challenging, so if anyone has ANY advice on the following I would be so so grateful for your insight &lt;3

1) I've done my best to document my ex partner's abuse over the past 3 years as best I could (still things I wish I'd done, but even so, I have a LOT) - thousands of highly abusive text messages, video recordings, voice messages, paperwork on the 7 times he's been institutionalized (yes, seven). I finally reached my limit with his abusive texts and INCESSANT calling and went full no contact about three months ago. But a few days ago I realized he'd been driving past my house /parking there etc. and Im terrified. My attorney said the best move forward is to file for a stalking protection order, which is great because I'm tired of living in fear, but it also means that I have no fewer than 14 days to get all of this evidence I've collected together for the hearing.

2) I've been working to build a timeline / narrative / documentation with exhibits for MONTHS and I'm still nowhere near close to being done. It's super triggering and as a single mom of a toddler, it's not like I have tons of time on my hands. I work full time. I give my daughter 110% of my fully engaged self, and then I have to sit down and go through all this stuff after I put her to bed and clean the house. 

How does anyone manage to do all of this? I feel like I'm trying to drink water from a firehose. I can't risk not providing the courts all of the information to show how truly unsafe he is but I'm also not a machine. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to organize thousands of text messages/videos quickly (and in a way that would be accepted by a court?). I've downloaded apps, paid for software, but I'm still drowning in this process. 

Teach me your survival stories. There's got to be something that I'm not doing right (or just not doing at all) because I simply can't imagine that any person, especially a person who is suffering from PTSD due to extreme abuse, can just pull all this together at the drop of a hat.

Hope all of you are healthy, safe and well right now - and for those of you who are not, I hope you find the validation, hope, and information you need to keep yourself safe. -In solidarity, SL",domesticviolence

I was visiting a childhood friend today. We haven't seen each other in a year and decided to have a small party/gathering with some friends at his place. His parents were away for the evening and would come back later that evening. Since he lives quite far away, he invited me to stay over night and go home the next day. 
After the party we went upstairs to his room and watched a movie. His father was downstairs in the living room watching tv and his mom went to sleep in the room next to us.
At some point late that night, we heard some glass breaking downstairs. We thought his father might have dropped a plate or something, so we didn't go to check on him. However, mom woke up and went downstairs to see what happened. 
They had a short argument and then she started screaming and called for my friend. He went to the living room and I stayed in his room. I heard his mom yell that he (his dad) hit her in the face. She stormed off and locked herself in her room. My friend cleaned up the mess downstairs and came back upstairs and didn't say a word for the rest of the night. We finished the movie and I went to bed in another room upstairs.

[CA] DV restraining order help,"hello all I have a 3 year restraining order against my childrens father due to physical abuse and stalking (also have sole physical and legal custody of children). Stalking was so bad I moved out of town 1 year ago. Yesterday I got a message request from a burner account of his telling me he worked for UPS and knows my address, even went as far as to tell me where I was -city wise- . Said hes opening up a new case on me to get the kids back and that I need to stop ""running from him"". Spooked me very much considering the circumstances, so I reported it. Cop came out and saw my evidence and screen recording etc, said ""alright this looks good to me, let me take your order and get pictures of it in my car"" when he came back he said the order was popping up in his system as ""not served"" therefore charges couldnt be pressed on their behalf.  I called the city I'd fled from and had the civil rights rep email me my court transcripts that prove he was present at our last court date in August 2019 in attempt to modify the restraining &amp; custody order (it was denied). At the end of the 2019 court transcript, it reads ""Restraining Order(s) heretofore made to remain in effect"" I called police back in current city to ask if someone could take my report now that I had this information, someone took it and forwarded it to the DA. Very solid evidence. The officer just said they may run into an obstacle with the fact that it says ""not served"" in their system when it comes to the DA. I just made the report friday, at the August 2019 court date I presented evidence that he was still a threat and it wasnt addressed at all, so I have thin faith going into this and feel like this just may jeopardize my children and I and anger the restrained party more, especially if nothing will be done.

First time my bf of almost 4 years choked me,"I’m new to reddit, but I truly feel so alone and genuinely have no idea who to talk to or what to do. My bf (25) and I (25f) were driving home from a birthday party tonight and he asked me why I was in a bad mood. I started responding by saying I felt like he left me during the party and practically acts like we don’t know each other while interacting with everyone else, especially girls. I told him it hurts my feelings and he told me I have a mouth I should use it if I want to feel included. Which I did! I was talking to people, but I just felt like (and this is how I usually feel in groups with him) that he was specifically ignoring me, like wouldn’t even look at me. And I didn’t want to be that annoying girlfriend who can’t make her own friends or needs to be babysat at a party which I’m not, I just don’t know if I’m being unreasonable about wanting him to acknowledge me more even with just a touch or a little consideration while we’re out and hanging with people. But I probably shouldn’t have brought it up because he had been drinking pretty heavily and was already upset about some information he found out earlier in the night. So anyway I get done telling him how I feel and the fight starts escalating to him screaming at me and then I start screaming back and then while we’re stopped at a stop light he starts choking me for about 10-15 seconds I think, I’m not sure how long it was because I couldn’t breathe and I was terrified. I threw the car in park and ran out onto the sidewalk as far away as I could. He then got in the drivers seat and then drove off. I called his sister to pick me up and when I got home he apologized, but I told him I wanted him to go. He then proceeded to tell me that the months of couples therapy that we have been in has all been a lie and we should be honest that our relationship is shit. I ask him to leave again and he goes. He then calls me about 30 minutes later apologizing and saying he was just angry at me and he’s very sorry for being physical and that he only said the hurtful thing about couples therapy because he was very upset and he didn’t mean it at all, he just wanted to say something to hurt me.

I just don’t know what to do. I’m so confused. I love him and we live together and have always planned on eventually getting married. He definitely has a bad temper and has been very disrespectful in the past, like telling me to shut the fuck up when I tell him how I feel etc. but I can’t help thinking I’m just miserable to be around and I’m very selfish and can only talk about me and how things make ME feel, which is why he’s constantly pissed off when I bring things up and why he got physical tonight.

Yesterday he did it in public and someone called the police but I covered for him. Today he lied to me and I called him out on it and he slammed my head against the ground pull chunks out of my hair, choked me and left bruises and scratch my body.

My problem is, for some reason I still love him and I don't want to hurt him or leave him, I don't know what to do, I can't stop crying and fearing for my sons safety

Please help me.",domesticviolence
Do I contact neighbor who witnessed abuse six years ago?,"Me and my stbx had fights more frequent and violent about seven to six years ago. It all escalated when I screamed in tears at my partner not to hit me anymore. He didn't stop of course so I was after him, too, I was yelling, and everyone may heard. Including my neighbor, a woman in 30s, with three kids. She was trying to get in contact me later when I got my first kid. She was nice, but nosy. My partner suspected she was talking in neighborhood about him abusing him. One day she came to our door to hand us a cake she made but he just closed the doors in front of her face and we never talked since.

However we are both active on local forum, but we never comment directly. She said in one post that she was also a victim of abuse but she escaped and now has a good marriage. I suppose she wanted to get in contact with me to help me. Or not. I can't really figure that out since she was approaching him, too, outdoor and acted nice. I suppose she attracted him at one period and he would probably try to establish an affair with her, like he did recently with another neighbor, but all turned down when he thought she is badmouthing him everywhere.

Anyway, I'm now in a question do I tell her something. I'm leaving him and I don't want her to feel bad about what happened inbetween since he is an asshole. But she already knows that.",domesticviolence
Can’t sleep - scared he’ll come here...,"So it’s the middle of the night.

Three nights ago he broke the protection order - by coming here in the middle of the night and smashing through the door with a metal pole.

He’s out on bail. But he’s already broken it by calling.

Court is this week. But he’s already threatened suicide to try and get us to talk to him. He’s said no one loves him or cares. He’s spreading lies about us.

This is hell. I need sleep but I can’t.

We have video evidence since we’ve got security cameras, but the police didn’t seem interested in seeing it.

It looks really bad.

He hasn’t cared about the police’s rules before.
He says it’s our fault he’s in trouble with them at all. That it means we don’t care about him.

He doesn’t care that he could end up in jail. He doesn’t care about what he’s doing and how it’s hurting us. He only cares that all of this makes him look bad to others, and he thinks it’s our fault if people find out.

I’m just worried the police won’t do anything.",domesticviolence
my best friend is being abused,"the title says it all. my best friend (19 f) is being abused, both physically and mentally by her boyfriend, and i don’t know what to do or how to help her. she hasn’t been responding to my texts, which is normal she takes a long time to reply sometimes but this time something felt off. i get a bunch of IG dms from her today explaining her dad took away her phone and keys because her neighbor told her dad about her and her boyfriend. i assume he sees them sneaking in and out and smoking weed outside. she told me she’s depressed and being abused and that she has bruises and cuts all over body from both being hurt from her boyfriend and trying to harm herself as well. her jaw is messed up and her tooth is chipped too. she told me he keeps getting mad at her for little things and they just end up in a screaming match and denies that the marks on her body are from him and only from her. but they’re not obviously. he’s really bipolar and unstable in my opinion and this has been ongoing. he also makes her have sex when she’s not in the mood and then gets mad when she doesn’t want to do things. she’s even having troubling remembering things because it’s happening so often and she can’t recall everything to tell me. i’ve known about the verbal abuse but i think this is the first time she’s confided in me about the physical abuse. i’m so mad writing this and i was so mad reading her messages because he’s the biggest piece of shit i’ve ever met. he’s nice in person but it’s all an act. she said there’s so much she’s never told me and i’m just really worried about her. she’s really close with her sister but i don’t know if she’s telling her any of this. i think she’s texting me from a laptop or an ipad or something because she currently doesn’t have her phone and she’s just messaging me when she gets a chance to. i just don’t know how i can support her when i can’t see her or be with her and i want that piece of shit out of her life. he’s ruining her. please someone help me.",domesticviolence
"I’m confused, alone and afraid.","I’m currently in a relationship and we’ve been going for 5 years. This is my first and only boyfriend in my 25 years of life. In the beginning everything was beautiful and I felt so loved but then things changed. A year and a half into the relationship I found out my bf would masturbate to pictures of his girl best friends and even to pictures of his sister in laws. I asked him to stop since he was so close to them and even asked him to stop hanging out with them if he saw them in any way other then as friends. He told me he felt nothing for them and what he was doing was normal and had no emotional connection. He said he didn’t even want to have real sex with them. I began to get jealous and insecure so I would check his phone often and realized he continued to do it. I didn’t leave him because that was my first bf and felt like I loved him. One day he got annoyed that I kept asking him to unfriend them on social media and screamed at me saying “you get your feelings hurt because you want to. I’m going to keep doing this and it’s your fault if your feelings get hurt.” I should’ve taken that as a sign and left. 

As time went by my jealousy would get worse and my confidence levels no longer existed. I became so needy to the point where I would ask what he was doing all the time and he got fed up and slapped me. Again, I didn’t take that as a sign cause I loved him. 

In November 2018 my mom kicked me out of the house because I got into an argument with one of her sisters. Of course she took their side and I was out on the streets. I lived in my car for a few days since I have no other family and occasionally my bf would sneak me into his house. I had a job but I had just started so I didn’t have money for my own place. His mom let me stay there for the remainder of the year until I was able to find my own please. I ended up getting pregnant and I told him about it...his reaction was to get mad, slap me, grab me by the hair and tell me I was stupid for not taking care of myself. He said he was too young to end his life and he didn’t want anything of it. 

January 2nd 2019 he forced me to get an abortion. I was afraid to live on the streets again and had nowhere to go so I remained in his house. I said I wasn’t going to get an abortion and that I could keep the baby and take care of it myself and he wouldn’t have to worry about it. He continued to beat me and said if I didn’t go thru with the abortion he’d beat it out of me. I passed out in the waiting room of the abortion clinic because I was so scared and didn’t want to go through with it. One of the nurses took me to the back and gave me some Coca Cola to help my blood pressure levels. I remember crying so much and not being able to tell her why. When I heard the little heart beat I couldn’t contain myself yet I was so afraid. I was 8 weeks. The 2nd visit I had to speak to a counselor before the procedure and I was hoping she’d ask me if it was my choice and if I really wanted to go through with it. I wanted to hear her say that if it was against my will she could help. She didn’t. Instead she explained the procedure and showed me how it would work with a little model on her desk. I was so afraid about many things yet I did nothing about it. I was sedated via an IV and given Valium. I remember waking up crying so much because I knew it was over and my baby was gone. I was heavily sedated but I remember feeling my shirt was drenched in tears and the nurse had to walk me out to the car where my bf was waiting. She told him I was heavily sedated and that I wouldn’t stop crying. She said he had to make sure I ate and comfort me. I cried the whole way home and pretty much the whole day. I hated myself and still do. Till this day I hate myself more than him because I didn’t do anything to stop this. I was alone and couldn’t tell anyone other then him what was happening to me. I had no place to go other than his house. 

As time went by things changed. He became nicer, the beatings stop for a little bit until he moved in with me to my new place. When we get into serious arguments he tends to pull my hair or push me or punch me in the face. I’ve wanted to report him to the cops several times but he never leaves any signs. He’s also verbally abusive and emotionally. I’ve never bled, he hasn’t left any noticeable bruises and he’s never pulled hair out of my head to show as evidence. I feel like if I say anything they won’t believe me and it will make things worse when he comes back home. 

I also looked up domestic violence signs and I’m afraid they’ll charge me for domestic violence since I would check his phone without permission and invade his privacy in social media. I don’t want to go to jail. I never called him names and never laid a hand on him not even in self defense. 

I’m sorry this post is so long but I just had to vent. Can anyone help me or guide me? Please don’t be harsh with me in regards to the abortion or all the things I’m allowing him to do. I already hate myself enough and I’m just afraid since I have no one else but him.",domesticviolence
Husband of 4 years arrested today after holding me down and choking me,"Not the first time of him choking me but will be the last.
My husband of 4 years has lied to me from day one of marriage. He is a drug addict and never disclosed this information to me until after we were married. 
He was clean after we got married for about 10 months, then has relapsed on and off for 3 years.
Today was horrible all I saw was murder in his eyes all while him yelling at me that if I just listened for once and shut up we could talk and move on.
It’s been 4 years of mental, emotional and financial abuse. 
All while he makes/made me feel like if I just did better he would too.
I realize now his problems are not my problem or my fault. 
It hurts , but being alive and not dead is more important than trying to continue to see the good he could be.

my cousin is physically/emotionally abusing his girlfriend (and mother of his children). how do i help her?,"my cousin and his girlfriend have a newborn together (3months) and he has taken in his girlfriends son (8y/o). they both live with my aunt in her apartment. his girlfriend has never spoken to me directly, but has opened up to other family members about the abuse going on. my cousin has put his hands on his girlfriend multiple times (once while she was carrying their baby) and he refuses to let her work, forcing her to be financially dependent on him. he is constantly disrespecting her and sometimes my aunt joins him. the girlfriend understands she must leave and is trying to save up to move in with family in a different state, but you can understand how difficult this is for her. how can i help her? what organizations should i tell her to look into?

When do they stop getting to you?,"When does your abusive ex stop getting to you? It’s been 3 weeks no contact, and the girl he cheated on me with just texted me rubbing their relationship in my face. She’s claiming to be pregnant with his child, and who knows, it is probably true despite his vehement denies. 
I feel like this has greatly  reopened the wounds I was working on healing. 
I didn’t respond and blocked the number, but she always finds a way to message me. He’s currently incarcerated, and I broke down and messaged him to tell her to leave me alone. Then blocked his ability to respond. 
I just want to completely delete him from my memory, but part of me is wishing he’d reach out and tell me how much he misses me. How sorry he is for all the pain he’s caused. Deep down, a part of me hopes he gets out of jail and realizes what he lost, and begs for me to take him back. 
I’ve started talking to other people, but it feels like I’m being disingenuous cause I am still trying to get over this trauma bond. 
Why am I feeling this way about someone who almost killed me on multiple occasions? Please tell me I will get over this soon.",domesticviolence
Am I victimizing myself or was this intentional?,"I (26f) ended a 7 month relationship with my boyfriend (21m) a month and a half ago. He had always expressed to me how bad his anger used to be and how it's under control now. I never saw anything overly aggressive apart from some trust and control issues that weren't huge. 

When Covid began, we quarantined together and were working out in his workshop daily. We began to argue a bit as it was too much at once to be with each other 24/7. One night at the gym/shop, he was joking around and choked me but he grabbed me extremely hard and I instantly panicked because my vision went and I couldn't breathe. I finally got him to let go and I noticed that I felt out of body, my eyes were hurting, head hurting, etc. He just walked away back to his workout. I made it clear I wasn't mad but that I was in pain so I decided to sit out of the workout in fear of passing out. He then got angry and told me we had to leave, he got very quiet in car and asked me if I needed to go the hospital but with such a cold tone in his voice. I said no and we came home. He continued to be very annoyed with me and when I asked what was going on he said that ""it's always something that ruins his workout and when he can't workout he gets angry"". I felt very sad that this happened and I did not want him to cut his workout short and I was not angry. 

A week goes by and the fights got worse and I couldn't deal with it anymore. The night before we ended things, we got into a fight that really was silly but he got very angry. So much so that he went extremely red and got scary. He was screaming at me to ""come here"" because I wouldn't come near him. He went outside and punched the door in and was screaming. 

I hadn't seen him like what before and it was really scary. Things have ended and we haven't talked in about a month but I am finding myself caught up on the choking, I am thinking about it a lot, having nightmares about it... Worried that he was angry at himself for this happening again to him (I'm assuming here but maybe it's happened before?) 

I am unsure if it was truly a mistake in which I am finding something small and victimizing myself or finding the one thing to cling to to help me get over him. Or, was it intentional? The uncertainty just has me questioning it a lot. Any advice?",domesticviolence
The police ignored my domestic violence complaint - what do I do?,"So I just called the police tonight - ironic given what's going on with the protests - because it sounded like a man was hitting a woman in the apartment stairwell, and children were crying the background. The police said they would investigate. 

The police just drove by twenty minutes later and left without even stopping. The couple had already gone inside, but I told them what floor it was on. I called the police department back and asked why they didn't knock on any doors or even come inside the apartment. The department said that the incident was marked as ""cleared"" with no report on what happened. But I know that they didn't do anything. I waited for an hour and no one came.

When the fighting started I was like, well fuck, this is why we need the police I guess. But then the police didn't do anything... Is this normal? Are they just feeling spiteful right now? What else do I do? I know this isn't about me, but I'm a survivor and I feel like I have to do something. :(",domesticviolence

Advice Needed: How do I help my mother in an abusive relationship when she won’t talk to me about it?,"After my parents divorce a few years ago my mom met her now husband. He forced her to move 13 hours away from us (2 kids, 1 grandkid) and I now have very little contact with her. I have seen her once in 3 years and she was covered in bruises and other family members tell me a little bit about the abuse she encounters. But I think she is ashamed to tell me (her daughter) how bad things truly are. When we seldomly talk she pretends her life is doing just fine, and even brags how much better her abuser is than my dad.

My mom wishes I was never born,"I posted this in r/mentalHealth but I thought posting here might garner more specific responses

This is my first personal post to a forum like this in a really long time. I've always been made fun of and attacked for not having the textbook, loving relationship with my mom. This has made it really difficult to ask for help from anyone, as I'm used to my feelings being rejected. I'm in college now, but I've had this issue for my entire life. I live with my mom--my dad passed when I was young so its been the two of us for a really long time. She works a high-stress job and has always expected me to take school as seriously as she does her work. This means never hanging out with my friends after school if I don't want her calling and texting me a million times. If it were up to her, I'd be chained to a desk doing work 24/7 with a gag in my mouth. In middle school I was bullied to the point of self harm but she never even made an attempt to address the problem, saying that I was only 'being a baby' because I didn't want to do more work. When I told her what I was doing to myself she fully didn't believe me, calling me a pussy. I was 13. This attitude has persisted. Whenever other people are around us, she pretends as if we have this caring relationship when the reality is we really don't. She's good at acting as if it's true, so when we're at dinner with her friends and she says all these things about how hard I work all it does is make my blood boil. She calls me nicknames that she makes up on the spot and sends me looks as if she actually expects me to do the same. I'm not sure how sick in the head she is: i don't know if she actually believes that I love her or if this is all manipulation of me and her friends. The one person who's believed me is our neighbor, but even she only believed me when I was old enough for her to and when I had been telling her about the abuse for years on end. Whenever people leave the two of us alone, she goes on tirades about how I've failed her. I admit it's not just her that is nasty towards me, now that I'm older I know what she's doing is wrong and I call hr out on it. Probably not in the best ways, but I promise you I would never reciprocate the same energy she's sent my way. I've shown up to school with bruises more times than I can count and no one has ever thought twice about it or said anything to me. She's threatened me with her boyfriends and co-workers, saying that if I don't comply she's gonna get her boyfriend to beat me. People tell me I'm outgoing and confident, so I'm sure it's easy for people to laugh about the problems I have with my mom, believing that I'm exaggerating to be funny. A couple years ago I posted on socials that I got kicked out of the house on a school night in the middle of winter, and all the responses were ""haha epic"". I've convinced myself that the only reaction people will have to me talking about my mom issues is either laughter or disgust because that's been 99% of the responses. Whenever I bring up how she's treated me to her face, she denies everything. She even denies me hurting myself, she denies ever hitting me. This has driven me to the point of insanity. I know that she's never going to change so I need to find better ways of handling her. I've never had a conversation with someone who's had a similar experience but I'm hoping posting this will help me with that. I know there're people like me out there, I wish I had an easier time talking about it so that I could find them. I don't want my horrible relationship and experiences with her to carry over into other aspects of my life as I become an adult and move away. I have a really hard time dealing with her and she ruins a lot of my days. I wish I knew how to prevent her from doing this to me. I know that my anger towards her won't just go away if I move away and never respond to her, I have to process and heal. If anyone has advice on how to lessen her affect on me and how to process traumatizing childhood events I would appreciate it. Also, if there are more specific forums surrounding familial abuse I'm really looking to find support for this. Thank you",domesticviolence
Just need a space to vent,"I totally know my relationship is all wrong and pretty toxic. I've never been even particularly with a SO until I met my current one. We have been together about 4 years. 
This is a throwaway and I'll change small insignificant details to keep myself safe.

He is a little older than me but really immature. Hes so angry, all the time. The smallest things, an argument over me dropping a tiny bit of food can end up in him threatening to throw furniture at me.
I know its totally wrong. We bought a new house recently and I've had food and drink thrown over me, totally humiliating although it doesn't hurt.

I'm a stay at home worker with the stuff thats going on at the minute. He's not. I clean daily, cook everything including his meals for the night shifts he works.

But he says I do nothing. Just accuses me daily of playing on the Xbox all day (I definitely do not. 1 hour at most, or not at all). 

I'm feisty too and not one to take loads of abuse but it gets so out of hand and he either threatens me, throws things at me or breaks stuff and has hurt me before. He once pulled me round the garden by my hair and I lost chunks of it. 

So why do I feel no anger once it's done? Why am I so forgiving, and just want to love him and be loved? Cos when things are good they're awesome and about 10 mins after hes finished being like that I just want things to be fine and theres never any hard feelings on my part. I'm totally in love and just want to get on with stuff. Thats not normal is it, but I cant shake it off.

Also sometimes I feel guilty because of things I said or did when retaliating or to protect myself. I once kicked out at him because I was scared and caused a nasty bruise. Thats makes me feel like I cant tell anyone because I've done wrong too.

Why does my brain and my heart tell me I love him and to stay? Why arent I running for the hills?",domesticviolence
Police abolition and domestic abuse/stalking: question?,"Hey all! I consider myself an abolitionist when it comes to policing. I have a friend (white woman) who got out of a physically and emotionally abusive relationship (with a Black man) about a year ago. He beat her, threatened to kill her, and pulled a gun on her many times. When the relationship ended, she filed a restraining order against him; that order has now expired, but her ex continues to stalk her and try and get in contact with her. 

However, after educating herself further and in light of all that is happening right now regarding police violence and murder against Black people, she does not feel right filing for a second restraining order or reporting him to the police, or involving them at all in the matter. At the same time, she is afraid for her life and believes that he would kill her given the opportunity. I am really at a loss for what to say or how to help and despite my readings on the subject of abolition; I have no idea how to help her stay safe in the immediate present and am not sure what advice to give or what direction to point her in. Does anyone have any experience with a situation like this and have any insight to offer?",domesticviolence

"Push from the stairs, choke, lock in the room, kicked, punched, hit by the metal stick, it’s all about love?","For 4 years,,, the relationship was so beautiful, full of compassion, until i move to another country to stay with my husband, he start destroy my stuffs, he destroy my favorite ukulele which i have that for long time,, 
I love him so much, i make that as a reason i always forgive him again and again, he is very controlling with money as well, everytime i got my salary he will check my bank account and ask me to transfer my half salary to his saving account, and once again i do that because i love him, he have bigger salary than me but still i do it coz of “Love” and i realize he have anger issues, i try to help him to go to the anger management program, counselling, but non of it is works,,
I try to remember what he is done to me,,, too many,, 

The reasons was he fill his brain with dating site, chat with his online gf,, 
Once i told off the online gf,, the gf will tell my husband, and he start punishing me, even i just bck from work and tired,, he just all over me with the rude words, and metal stick on his hand hit my body,,,, 
I learn self defence but one it comes to someone that you love, you only can stare at him and thinking that why this happened to me? why he do this to me? Full of why? Why? 
With big expectation that he will change one day! 
Then few days passed, he will start apologize to me and take me shoping, buy the luxury stuff that i don’t ask and i don’t like,,, 
I feel like a robot! I am not being my self , i am happy person, and be with him i am scare.
One day i bring ceramic cupboard from overseas, just because it’s scratch a lil bit from the flight, he destroy that in front of me, throw to my self, once again i only cry cry and thinking why me? What my fault ? Am i deserve this?

And it’s happening to me!!!! 

One day i take one step forward,, i see the advertisement about domestic violence, and i start to call that number, they book me appointment for seeing the advocate, then i met her (my husb dunno about it) 
I tell him i go shoping , then i sneak to the DV advocates office, 
When i met her, i tell her about everything,, and she said i must leave him , i said i’m not ready, because i still believe in him, he will change for me, i want good marriage, and i want once marriage for forever,,,have a family,,, 

Second visit i arrange with DV advocate, and still same i answer i not ready to leave,,,because “i love him”

After 6 months from my last visit to DV advocate, it’s normal day, after work, i cleaning, laundry, cooking,,
When i hang laundry (he help me hang the laundry) he found out that his note inside his shorts is damage, he start being furious to me,, call me “fucking moron” “what an idiot” “useless cunt” ,, over the note :(
He start lock me in the laundry room, then he go through my phone for checking if i message anyone,, i scream “help help” no one hear me,, i just crying,, not crying because i am hurt physically , but i am crying because i am hurt inside,, mentally hurt :(( ,,,, this is my husband,, he supposed to protect me,, love me,, comfort me,,, makes me happy,,, but he is not :((

Then for 30 mins im crying in the room,, he let me out,, he not allow me sleeping on the bed “if i found out in the morning you sleeping on the bed, i will punch your fcking face” 
And once again,, i start crying,, not because i sleep on the floor, i can sleep everywhere doesnt matter for me i am easy, but i am crying because my husband treat me worse than animal,, until now i still remember how mentally hurt i am at that time thinking, he supposed to be the one that protect me....

My sacrifice is nothing...
I am wasting my time...
My marriage is a joke...
He lied to me the whole entire time...

No one in this world deserve domestic violence,,
They not love you if they hurt you!

She was sweet to me,"She was sweet to me.

God, was she charming. She swept me off my feet the moment we met, I don't usually fall for people 

but she had everything I liked. She was tall (6ft) and butch and I was smitten by her protectiveness and how she treated me. 

She bought me dinners (I never paid for a single thing, she wouldn't let me pay or even tip myself), jewelry, clothes, took me out, just all that kind of stuff. It was a first to me to have someone treat me so... I don't know like I was special. She made me feel special. It was ok at first. 

Then at home one day she's talking about work, complaining about something, and I made a sarcastic quip about the situation. Don't even remember what I said, next thing I know I'm holding onto the side of my face because she's smacked me across my cheek. I just kinda sat there shocked and asked 

if she really just hit me, she said she didn't mean to hit me that hard. I didn't know what to do so I just said it was ok, it was a mistake and a one time thing, we went to bed. 

My life changed after that night. She became demanding, scary, intimidating. I'm 5'3 140lbs, she was 6' and little over 300lbs, so she constantly used her large frame to back me into corners while berating me over something I said or did, restraining me if I ever tried to get away, pinning me against walls to show she was stronger than I was. Stuff like that. 

One bad night we went to a bar, I went to the patio to smoke and another woman followed me and started hitting on me, asking to buy me another drink. I was explaining I was here with someone when my girlfriend walked out and flipped the fuck out. She walked over and I guess her look or something sent the other woman scurrying away, while I began to be yelled at about being a lying, cheating whore (the usual go to). 

I was tired that night so I got up and walked away, out of the bar while figuring out how the fuck I was going to get home. She of course followed me, and I blame myself for letting her pull me into an alley. I should have stayed in view of other people. Well she screamed at me some more, wouldn't 

stop grabbing me and she finally pushed too hard and I stumbled backwards and smashed my face into the cement wall and suddenly I found myself spitting out one of my teeth as it was cracked and broken by the impact. 

I still fucking stayed. I started crying and she hugged me and apologized, we went home and I just laid in bed while she did whatever she wanted to me and waited for her to be done and fall asleep so I could just cry into my pillow. 

It became all the time. The hits became routine. Around her friends (I was not allowed to speak to my friends cause the me being a whore and all) she would make fun of me for being mentally ill, that I was so stupid I had to drop out of college, she had to take care of me, ect ect. If I said something she didn't like she'd pinch me and twist (like sitting at the table she could pretend to pat my thigh while really she was punishing me for what I said). 

She quickly learned the key was not to hit me in the face or choke me because that leaves bruises where people could see. So my chest/ribs, lower back, and legs were all fair game. 

I never realized others noticed when I was once again explaining walking awkwardly because I fell (again), or ran into a door (again), or slipped in the shower. The excuses were bullshit to everyone but they whispered to each other never asked if I was ok. 

She convinced me to get off my meds for my bipolar disorder. She told me she liked me manic 

because I was better in bed. So I stopped, my depression became worse, I was becoming more isolated and had no one to talk to, and my anxiety was at it's worst in my life.

But I didn't tell anyone what was going on. I felt like I deserved it. I hated myself, so it seemed fitting to be hit and degraded since I was so self loathing. 

Then someone did reach out. 

I got a text from an unknown person, asking if she had the right number. I said yes, who is this? 

They wouldn't tell me who they were, just they were friends with my girlfriend and they thought something was going on. She or he told me they had been in an abusive relationship in the past and every time they saw me with my partner they could see something was up. They also informed me she was making fun of me (like were teenagers not in our mid 20's) to her group of friends. 

Apparently, she would mock my depression and said I was nasty, that I threatened to kill myself if she left me, that I pulled out my hair, cut myself for attention, discussed our bedroom activities and showed pictures I had sent her sexting in the past. 

I was humiliated. But it was the last straw, I don't know what clicked but I realized I needed to get the fuck out, this needed to end now. 

So while she was at work I gathered all my things and left, went back to my parents home, and just sat in one of the bedrooms crying for hours and throwing up because I was terrified she was going to come after me. She sent me some vile texts and I eventually had to block her on everything as she was harassing the fuck out of me. 

The things I trusted her enough to tell her, like being raped as a child, was all used against me. She told anyone who would listen the things I told her in confidence. But I wasn't mad, I was numb. So what? I asked myself, I could easily disprove or correct the things she was saying so I thought screw her. 

I told my psych what had been going on and he was very supportive, told me I was worth more than someone abusing me, I didn't deserve it, he was just really nice about it. He didn't make me feel like it was my fault and that felt good. Hell, it just felt good telling someone what had been going on since I had bottled it up for over a year.

I'm back on meds now and in a lot better place than I was just three months ago. I'm working on coping with substance abuse (being drunk made being hit not hurt as badly, and I preferred being able to pass out while she used my body how she wanted in bed) and it's a struggle but without being abused and scared all the time I think I might be able to work on that now. 

I know this was a long rambling rant but I just am so bewildered why I put up with the abuse for so 

long. I'm a victims advocate, I've helped others escape abuse from partners (it's really rampant in the 

LGBT community, just not talked about as much), but I couldn't leave myself because she broke me 

down. I still think sometimes it all happened to another person, as I don't know who that person was 

who was playing the victim role.

I don't know where this is going so I'm going to end this here. Thanks for listening/reading. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to see red flags before it gets too bad? This is now the second partner in my life who has turned abusive, although this one was the worst by far, but I really feel like I am to blame since this keeps happening. 

Thanks ya'll.",domesticviolence

Trapped and Potential Prevention,"Say your sibling is growing increasingly aggressive over the last year.

Landlord looking for help with loud domestic violence in front yard,"Hi, I’m looking for advice on how to be an ally in this situation - even if that advice is “don’t do anything”. I am located in Missouri. 

I am a new landlord and my new tenants are generating multiple complaints from the neighbors regarding extremely loud and aggressive fights in the front yard of the house. 1 of the parties is aggressive and the other is not. Both of the parties are in the lease. 

I have not discussed with the tenants yet because I don’t know how. This type of disturbance may violate provisions of the lease that call for “quiet enjoyment of the neighbors”, although I feel strongly that attempting to evict the whole household would be harmful to the victim. 

What should I do now? Open to all suggestions, thank you for your time.",domesticviolence
Being used as a punching bag for my sister,"My younger sister (I’m 24F and she’s 19) starting going to an MMA gym 3 years ago and she started hurting me shortly after that. We live together in the same house and she does it all the time. A list of just some of the things she’s done to me:

-dislocated my shoulders. 
-broke my ankle. 
-broke my ribs by kicking me. 
-punched my chest and collapsed my lung. 
-punched my stomach hard enough to make me throw up.
-wrecked my face (with punches and knees) left me with bleeding lips, swollen eyes.

I would say that she beats me up at least once a week. It just happens at random and I keep saying I’m sorry but I don’t even know what I did wrong. I hardly eat now, because of how she hurts my stomach. I’m 6’1 and I barely weigh 122 (used to be about 155 before this started). I have no energy and I’m desperately hungry all the time. When I beg her to stop she says that because of how tall I am, I should be able to take the beatings. I have a boyfriend and he just laughed me off and said the same thing, that my sister is so much smaller than me so she can’t be hurting me that bad. My mom who’s house we live in says the same thing and laughs at me for complaining. When I had to go to the hospital for all those injuries she just said that my sister was being a little rough and didn’t mean any harm. The thing is, she hits me so hard. It really hurts and it leaves me in pain for days afterward. I’m so tired of being in pain and being hungry and feeling sick and all the rest of it.",domesticviolence

"My boyfriend hit me, I know I should leave, what’s stopping me?","My boyfriend has a temper, he gets in a mood where he gets mad often and then he will start casually calling me a bitch and making passive aggressive comments. Two years ago he stole my phone out of my hands to read what I was saying to my friend. I was talking to her because he’d said he hates my voice and my face, I’m annoying and he wants me to go away. He also threw me on the floor that time. 

About a year ago we had a fight in the restaurant we worked at and he called me a fucking bitch shouted go fuck yourself in front of everyone and stormed out. We didn’t speak for three months and he was angry all that time. Eventually I’d left my bag in the restaurant overnight and he came in one morning screaming about how much he hates me and dumped my stuff into the toilet. 

After that he sincerely apologised for being so crazy and we became friends. After many months we got back together, now we are living together with his dad in the country because our restaurant closed down and we lost our jobs. Yesterday he got angry and I tried to get him to talk to me, he kneed me in the face threw me on the ground and punched me. I said I’m definitely leaving and organised my friend to come and get me when it’s the right time. 

Then he talked to me about it, at first he said it was my fault, id wanted him to hit me and taunted him. I said that’s not what happened and eventually he was sorry and said he would not do it again. But when I asked him what he would do instead or how he was going to work on it he got angry again and said I should work on my social issues like “not knowing when to shut up”. I said I need time to get over it and later on decided to make the peace. 

I KNOW that literally everything in this situation points to that I should leave because he’s going to do it again, he blames me for it and thinks I deserve it, and isn’t going to even try to change. I am basically ready to go and can call my friend at any time. But I can’t bring myself to. Does anyone know what’s going on? Do I want to stay? Has anyone else felt like this?

TLDR; boyfriends temper got out of control and he got violent for the third time in our relationship, he’s not sorry and I know I should leave but can’t bring myself to, help.",domesticviolence
tips for organizing 3 years of documented abuse for DVCPO hearing,"I need help and I can't imagine I'm the only one who's ever found the documentation process challenging, so if anyone has ANY advice on the following I would be so so grateful for your insight &lt;3

1) I've done my best to document my ex partner's abuse over the past 3 years as best I could (still things I wish I'd done, but even so, I have a LOT) - thousands of highly abusive text messages, video recordings, voice messages, paperwork on the 7 times he's been institutionalized (yes, seven). I finally reached my limit with his abusive texts and INCESSANT calling and went full no contact about three months ago. But a few days ago I realized he'd been driving past my house /parking there etc. and Im terrified. My attorney said the best move forward is to file for a stalking protection order, which is great because I'm tired of living in fear, but it also means that I have no fewer than 14 days to get all of this evidence I've collected together for the hearing.

2) I've been working to build a timeline / narrative / documentation with exhibits for MONTHS and I'm still nowhere near close to being done. It's super triggering and as a single mom of a toddler, it's not like I have tons of time on my hands. I work full time. I give my daughter 110% of my fully engaged self, and then I have to sit down and go through all this stuff after I put her to bed and clean the house. 

How does anyone manage to do all of this? I feel like I'm trying to drink water from a firehose. I can't risk not providing the courts all of the information to show how truly unsafe he is but I'm also not a machine. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to organize thousands of text messages/videos quickly (and in a way that would be accepted by a court?). I've downloaded apps, paid for software, but I'm still drowning in this process. 

Teach me your survival stories. There's got to be something that I'm not doing right (or just not doing at all) because I simply can't imagine that any person, especially a person who is suffering from PTSD due to extreme abuse, can just pull all this together at the drop of a hat.

Hope all of you are healthy, safe and well right now - and for those of you who are not, I hope you find the validation, hope, and information you need to keep yourself safe. -In solidarity, SL",domesticviolence

My friends father just beat his wife while I was at a sleepover.,"This is a throwaway account to protect everyone involved in this incident.
This is also the first time I'm posting something on reddit but I'm completely lost and I don't know what else to do.
I was visiting a childhood friend today. We haven't seen each other in a year and decided to have a small party/gathering with some friends at his place. His parents were away for the evening and would come back later that evening. Since he lives quite far away, he invited me to stay over night and go home the next day. 
After the party we went upstairs to his room and watched a movie. His father was downstairs in the living room watching tv and his mom went to sleep in the room next to us.
At some point late that night, we heard some glass breaking downstairs. We thought his father might have dropped a plate or something, so we didn't go to check on him. However, mom woke up and went downstairs to see what happened. 
They had a short argument and then she started screaming and called for my friend. He went to the living room and I stayed in his room. I heard his mom yell that he (his dad) hit her in the face. She stormed off and locked herself in her room. My friend cleaned up the mess downstairs and came back upstairs and didn't say a word for the rest of the night. We finished the movie and I went to bed in another room upstairs.

It's almost 4 in the morning and I can't sleep. I'm afraid and I don't know what to do. My parents divorced because of domestic violence when I was little and it broke my family and I can't stand the thought of it happening again to my friends family. I love them very much and they seemed to be the perfect family.
Should I try to talk to them in the morning?

[CA] DV restraining order help,"hello all I have a 3 year restraining order against my childrens father due to physical abuse and stalking (also have sole physical and legal custody of children). Stalking was so bad I moved out of town 1 year ago. Yesterday I got a message request from a burner account of his telling me he worked for UPS and knows my address, even went as far as to tell me where I was -city wise- . Said hes opening up a new case on me to get the kids back and that I need to stop ""running from him"". Spooked me very much considering the circumstances, so I reported it. Cop came out and saw my evidence and screen recording etc, said ""alright this looks good to me, let me take your order and get pictures of it in my car"" when he came back he said the order was popping up in his system as ""not served"" therefore charges couldnt be pressed on their behalf.  I called the city I'd fled from and had the civil rights rep email me my court transcripts that prove he was present at our last court date in August 2019 in attempt to modify the restraining &amp; custody order (it was denied). At the end of the 2019 court transcript, it reads ""Restraining Order(s) heretofore made to remain in effect"" I called police back in current city to ask if someone could take my report now that I had this information, someone took it and forwarded it to the DA. Very solid evidence. The officer just said they may run into an obstacle with the fact that it says ""not served"" in their system when it comes to the DA. I just made the report friday, at the August 2019 court date I presented evidence that he was still a threat and it wasnt addressed at all, so I have thin faith going into this and feel like this just may jeopardize my children and I and anger the restrained party more, especially if nothing will be done.

First time my bf of almost 4 years choked me,"I’m new to reddit, but I truly feel so alone and genuinely have no idea who to talk to or what to do. My bf (25) and I (25f) were driving home from a birthday party tonight and he asked me why I was in a bad mood. I started responding by saying I felt like he left me during the party and practically acts like we don’t know each other while interacting with everyone else, especially girls. I told him it hurts my feelings and he told me I have a mouth I should use it if I want to feel included. Which I did! I was talking to people, but I just felt like (and this is how I usually feel in groups with him) that he was specifically ignoring me, like wouldn’t even look at me. And I didn’t want to be that annoying girlfriend who can’t make her own friends or needs to be babysat at a party which I’m not, I just don’t know if I’m being unreasonable about wanting him to acknowledge me more even with just a touch or a little consideration while we’re out and hanging with people. But I probably shouldn’t have brought it up because he had been drinking pretty heavily and was already upset about some information he found out earlier in the night. So anyway I get done telling him how I feel and the fight starts escalating to him screaming at me and then I start screaming back and then while we’re stopped at a stop light he starts choking me for about 10-15 seconds I think, I’m not sure how long it was because I couldn’t breathe and I was terrified. I threw the car in park and ran out onto the sidewalk as far away as I could. He then got in the drivers seat and then drove off. I called his sister to pick me up and when I got home he apologized, but I told him I wanted him to go. He then proceeded to tell me that the months of couples therapy that we have been in has all been a lie and we should be honest that our relationship is shit. I ask him to leave again and he goes. He then calls me about 30 minutes later apologizing and saying he was just angry at me and he’s very sorry for being physical and that he only said the hurtful thing about couples therapy because he was very upset and he didn’t mean it at all, he just wanted to say something to hurt me.

I just don’t know what to do. I’m so confused. I love him and we live together and have always planned on eventually getting married. He definitely has a bad temper and has been very disrespectful in the past, like telling me to shut the fuck up when I tell him how I feel etc. but I can’t help thinking I’m just miserable to be around and I’m very selfish and can only talk about me and how things make ME feel, which is why he’s constantly pissed off when I bring things up and why he got physical tonight.

Am I at risk here or just overreacting? (Long),"I have been in lockdown with a housemate ('Alex') for over 2 months now. Alex has been having really loud arguments with their partner ('Taylor'), has been screaming at them, crying, shouting abuse at them, and often throws things. They have since taken a 'relationship break' - Alex and Taylor are still talking but are not broaching emotional topics that could lead to arguments or having sexual discussions. They agreed that they are no longer 'dating' but may revisit a relationship once they can see each other in person again, but also provided some caveats that Alex work on their emotional regulation and Taylor work on their communication.

Alex had been listening to love songs on repeat, looking through old photos, and hasn't been doing any of the work they promised to do on their emotions. They have stated that they can't help their trauma or what triggers them, and they believe that allowances should be made for them. Alex asked for my advice, and I gave it honestly - saying that relationships require compromise and triggers (while valid) can sometimes be irrational. Alex told me that one of their triggers was being controlled, which means they can never compromise. I agreed that controlling behaviour isn't good in a relationship. But I added that if a friend asks you to change something that upsets them, and it doesn't cause too much of an issue for you, it makes sense to try and change that for that friend. (Thinking in my head that Taylor has asked Alex to stop referring to them as derogatory names such as 'b*tch', 'd*ck', and others which are too offensive to type here.) Alex appeared to agree with me and even did some work and chatted to their therapist about it (over video chat).

A few days ago, Alex had a friend sitting outside on the street and we were all having socially distanced drinks. Alex got a bit drunk (on second drink?) and interrupted Alex's friend mid-sentence to shout at me: ""We need to stop this narrative that Alex can't have healthy relationships!"" (Yes referring to themselves in the 3rd person is common.)

It came out of nowhere. I was in the middle of paying for dinner which Alex had chosen and been all to happy to have me pay for.

Me: ""I'm sorry what are you talking about?""

Alex: ""You saying that I can never have healthy relationships is hurtful and unhelpful and it needs to stop!""

Me: ""I never said that you couldn't-""

Alex: ""I don't care. That's what it felt like and it hurts and it needs to stop!""

Me: ""But I never said that and I don't think that. I just said compromise is needed in a relationship. I am not validating what you think I said when I didn't say that and don't think that at all.""

Alex: ""I DON'T CARE!!!! YOU NEED TO STOP!!""

Alex's friend interrupts this and says that we shouldn't have this conversation while drunk. Alex takes a while to calm down but then talks to their friend while I'm sat feeling really afraid and still ordering and paying for dinner.

Alex's friend leaves and Alex goes upstairs and starts shouting on the phone to someone upstairs.

I'm quite afraid because Alex has thrown things at me and 'play hit' me a few times when frustrated (not hard enough to bruise but hard enough to hurt). I had a serious chat with Alex every single time and they keep pushing the boundary, like throwing things at the wall next to my head instead of at me. I've seen how loud and shouty Alex can get while upset, and I know it won't hurt me physically but I don't want to be screamed at or have things thrown at me. I also am concerned that Alex thinks that how what people say makes them feel matters more than what they said (this was a common theme with their arguments with Taylor too) so if I do try and talk about it Alex might not understand what I'm saying or get really really angry at me.

It escalated today. I spoke to my sister at 3pm in my closet in my bedroom and Alex apparently overheard? I've been sat in the living room all evening working on my laptop, when I went in the next room to take a call from my other sister.

Alex messaged me: Hey gal, if you’re going to have calls about me you’ll need to either go elsewhere to have them or keep your voice down And also if you need to move out then go ahead

Me: I'm talking about graduation photos?

Alex: Earlier you weren't.  I don’t know or care what you’re talking about now

Me: Okay

Alex:  But earlier really upset me, and instead of stewing I’m going to tell you  And tell you in future not to say hurtful things so loudly 

Me: I'm actually good thanks. Cool will do.

Alex: *thumbs up*

It turns out that Alex asked Taylor if anyone would have reason to be scared of Alex getting violent when angry or upset and Taylor had to remind Alex that Taylor had been hit, slapped, and had things thrown at them when Alex was upset. But that doesn't seem to be the answer Alex was looking for.

Then everything happened so fast I don’t remember too much I do remember him grabbing and pushing me again . My son helped me up I had scratch on my face and neck . My phone cracked my thumb hurt and my wrist. Later I found a bruise on the back of my arm. I discovered it because I was in pain the next morning

My son said the scratch from my face must be because when he came in I was on the table. Not A big table ,those little ones you use in the living room to eat.

I dont know if I should report it. I cslled today the police station  and was told I can report it anytime time.

Sorry for the format but my phone is cracked and not working well. 

I know it’s my decision but I don’t know what todo. He said he’s leaving but he has no where to go. I do want him out he tried to hug me the next day but this isn’t the first time . I know i did wrong by throwing a water bottle . There’s no excuse for that ! I know.

I didnt accept his apology because he’s done it before and I’m confused how he saw me on the floor my son had to help me up while I was crying with scratches and it didn’t click “ i messed up“ that hurt as well .

Idk if i should report it",domesticviolence
For my senior film I made an animation based on my experience with domestic abuse from my family. Please give it a watch! (more details in the comments),,domesticviolence
The time I finally broke and nearly killed my sister,"**My older sister was my abuser.**


It started small I guess. When I was really young we were like normal, hateful siblings. She would call me names. I would do things to spite her. I guess that was all how it was supposed to be at the time.


Elementary school was different. My mom worked until late at night, no dad in the picture. My sister would chase me around the house and beat me. She would ridicule and insult me the moment I left my room, like some sort of obsession.


As she got older, she became increasingly hostile toward me. She would attack me and chase me to my room, where I would close the door and lock it behind me. She learned to ""pick"" those easy house knobs, so I spent a lot of my elementary school home time with one hand on the door lock and the other hand playing with legos. I vividly remember my counselor asking if my mother tried to hurt me because of the bruises on my body. Thats another story though.


When I got into middle school, she moved on from abusing me. She got into drugs and began to abuse my family instead. My possessions were stolen, scary men came in and out of the house at night and my mother was an emotionally shattered husk. I just became hateful and numb.


I guess thats a really concise way to summarize a lifetime of abuse. There is so much to say, I just wanted to get you caught up.



--------------------------
**The story you probably came for:**


I was 15. I was laying on my bunkbed listening to music on my little speaker set. My phone was connected through an aux cord. I wish that detail didnt matter.


My sister was walking around the house. I could hear the floorboards creeking. I wasnt afraid, but her presence in the house always made me have some primal sense of alertness and anxiety. I was listening to the floorboards and approximating her position in the house, something I did normally.


At some point, she came into my room. This already put me on alert - she usually avoided my room. She just came in and started looking around my room. 


She focused in on my phone and my speaker set and scowled at them. ""You have an aux cord?""


""Yeah,"" I replied, ""just one of those cheap ones so I can connect my phone"" (I was always trying to downplay and mitigate conflict)


She replied with ""I want an aux cord"", followed by an awkward silence. 


I dont know what to say. She isnt getting my aux cord. ""Yeah mom and I found it at goodwill"".


She was examining the cord. ""Mom never gets me nice things.""


I dont know what to say, again. Luckily though, she walked out of the room.


As she walks out of my room and into the hallway, I hear her continuing to speak. It sounds like she is complaining, but I cant make out what she is saying. As she walks down the hallway away from my room, she starts to get louder. It gets to a point where she is screaming something at me from the other side of the house.


I am trying to avoid conflict. I go to my door and I shut it and lock both the door and the *bolt lock* that was installed on my door to protect me from her.


I hear the floorboards again, accompanied by further loud complaints. She is walking back to my room.


She stops at my door and turns the knob. She is obviously pissed that I locked it. ""Open the door.""


I figure with the bolt lock, Im in a position of power. She can fuck right off. ""No. I'm not fighting with you. Please leave.""


She continues. ""Open. The. Door.""


""No. I'm not opening it.""


""Open the fucking door.""


I just dont reply. I tend to lock up when I dont know what to say.


There is a moment of silence. My heart is beating out of my chest.


Suddenly, **BANG**, she kicks the fucking door! Adrenaline shoots through me. She kicks the door again. ""OPEN THIS FUCKING DOOR NOW"".


I dont know what to do. I text my mom. I know she cant help. She keeps kicking the door. The door is holding great. So glad I have a bolt lock.


She stops. I feel instantly relieved. Im thinking to myself that she must have tired herself out... But I dont hear the floorboards. She hasnt left, she is still in front of the door.


Im waiting for her to leave when she starts kicking the door again. She is shouting, but I cant understand what she is saying. I can hear the wood of the door being stressed and I start panicking


I had a shotgun under my bed. It wasnt loaded. I pulled it out and I pointed it at the door. 


I shouted ""(Sister), dont fucking come in here! I have a gu-"" and the door crashes open. The bolt lock has broken right through the frame of the door, which has been splintered. My sister is standing on the other side of the door watching me


**So here I am, pointing a unloaded shotgun at my sister, hoping to use it to bluff her off. *But she takes a step forward***.


(Sister): ""What are you going to do, shoot me?"" She takes another step toward me


""Do it! Fucking shoot me, (slur)! Shoot me!"" She takes another step foward.


""(Slur) (slur)! Fucking kill me!"" Another step


Suddenly she starts sprinting at me, screaming. 


What happened is a blur in my memory, but the next thing I know, I have her pinned to the wall outside my room and the shotgun has scratched a long line in the floor from being thrown down the hallway


Adrenaline was pumping through me. My heart was beating harder than I had ever felt before. She was kicking me. I felt nothing at all. No pain. 


I grabbed her by her throat. I remember her making this terrible choking sound and scratching at her neck. With my other hand, god, forgive me, I just started beating her. I had never fought anyone, I had never thrown a real punch, I had never done anything like that.


Its hard to describe, but it felt like something primal took over. I really just started beating her. Beating her as hard as I could. She was resisting and I just pushed her against the wall harder and beat her more. I was screaming in her face. Screaming about how she was the reason my mother is suicidal, and she is the reason that I camt be happy and..


I have this image burned into my mind, I stopped hitting her for a moment and I just remember there being blood on the wall next to her face and her nose just oozing blood, and I expect to see a look of pain on her face..


.. but.. she just smiled at me. This fucking crazy, wicked, demonic smile. I felt like I was beating a literal monster. She smiled at me and I just went back to beating her. I remember her tooth cutting my finger and I remember not feeling it and just continuing to beat her.


It was the most sickening, primal feeling. It was like I lost control. It was like my body wanted her *dead*. I am not a violent person at all but this was something else entirely.


So I beat her and beat her and beat her. At some point I come to my senses and I drop her. She starts screaming the moment I release her and starts hitting my face. 


Right away, like a reflex, I tackled her back up against the wall and I just started beating her again. Again and again and again and again and again. Once again, I had this primal voice telling me to beat her until she died.


I didnt. I dropped her a second time. This time she fell on her ass. She started crying loudly and jumped out of the hallway into the kitchen and ran into her room. I could hear her crying loudly from the hallway.


I went over and picked the shotgun up off the ground and I went in my room. I sat in the corner of the room and I loaded the shotgun. I pointed it at the door and I called 911.



-----------
**Aftermath**


The police came and my mom rushed home. The police were treating it like I was the abuser to my sister - they were talking about how I was going to be charged with some kind of felony assault (dofferent rules for 'domestic violence?') and I was trying to explain myself and they just werent having it at all. 


My mom arrived and started yelling at the officers, saying I had been abused all my life and how dare they ignore that she kicked in my bolt locked door and etc.. the officers just sounded pissed that they had to take a different angle at the situation


An officer came over to me and asked me what gun I pointed at my sister. I lied to them. I told them I pointed a BB gun at my sister. I didnt. I pointed a shotgun at her.


My sister told them I threatened her with a shotgun. They said it was my word versus hers, and that if it was the shotgun, I would be charged with something or another


Well.. my mom stepped in. She said i always tell the truth and that I wouldnt have done it. She took my side even though I was lying. I could see my sister break down emotionally all over again even through her bloodied face. The police decided to go with my side of the story and literally nothing happened.


No charges. No arrest. My sister had a deviated septum and I wouldnt be blown away if i caused brain damage. But literally there were no consequences. I still dont understand why I wasnt arrested when I had obviously beat the absolute shit out of her


---------


So... Yeah. Long story I guess.


Im 21 now.. that was when I was 15. She moved out shortly after that and is dying of hepatitis in another state now. I probably should feel bad for her, but I dont. I forgive her but I dont think I will ever feel empathy for her.


Im so glad I was never charged though. That would have ruined my chances at a nursing career. I'm two years into nursing school, and despite my abuse, I think I am doing okay in life.

I probably sound all dark and edgy. Sorry guys. Im really a nice guy I think. I just cant get this out of my mind today. I think i just needed to get that memory off of my mind.

I love you guys. Thank you for reading",domesticviolence
I told my therapist about arguments with my dad,"Yesterday I told my therapist about arguments with my dad she said its domestic abuse and emotional and that she will speak to her supervisor if I give her consent. I said it's not as simple as that cos the relationship is complicated and that I don't want to just throw the word abuse around. I also said I didn't want to get anyone into trouble. She said she would approach it delicately because of these reasons. She also said she would talk to me next week and wouldn't take any action after speaking with supervisor without my consent.

I regret giving consent now. Should I email her and tell her I don't want her to speak to her?

How would I word it?

I'm kinda freaking out I love my dad and I don't want him to get into trouble I just wanted to talk things through with someone.

Laying here thinking about committing suicide,"Another fight. Anytime I bring up my feelings I get screamed at. He gets so angry. He wants to hit me again I know it. I see it in his face. And he says it. He wants to hit me. He hates me. He told me I am exhausting. 

We got into a fight about sex. I have a high libido. It’s been over 2 weeks. He told me we could have sex tonight. It got a little late and he told me he was tired. I was disappointed. He knew I was upset. Started screaming at me to take my clothes off or get the fuck out and go live on the street. 

I was terrified. I had to close my eyes while he was in my face yelling at me. Staring at me. Like he hates me. He told me to leave in the morning. He says I won’t because I “don’t have anyone else” and he’s probably right. I don’t have anyone else. 

I don’t know what to do. I feel so empty. I am so tired of this. He’s cheated before and gets so angry he has to reassure me it won’t happen again. So mad. About everything. He’s mad when I’m anxious or sad or upset. He constantly gaslights me. I’m just so, so sad and feel so alone. 

My best friend in the whole world, truly my soulmate, died in 2013. I wish she was here more than anything. I’m 29, 30 next month. And all I want is someone to love me. Someone who kisses me and hugs me when they get home from work. Someone who looks at me like they love me. 

I’ll never have that. I will probably stay in this relationship. And he’ll either kill me or I will kill myself.",domesticviolence
I can hear my neighbour being abused.,"Yesterday I called the police on my neighbours for the 2nd time in 2 weeks. In case it's relevant, I live in the UK.

The first time, I heard lots of loud yelling, screaming, and crying. It was only the woman crying. I could also hear furniture and objects moving around loudly so I called the police. They came and as far as I'm aware, they spoke to the woman (I think the man had left the apartment by the time the police arrived).

Yesterday I heard them fighting again but this time it sounded like the situation had escalated. I definitely heard someone get slapped and based on what I could hear them saying (in Spanish), it was the woman who was slapped. She kept yelling ""respect me! Don't hurt me!"" over and over. It was extremely distressing. Called the police again and within 30 minutes I could see the cop outside my neighbour's building's door. A few minutes later the policeman calls me and says nobody is opening the door but 3 second later he says ""nevermind, someone's opened up"" and that was that/

This morning the police calls me again and says that they couldn't find the apartment yesterday. They went to the right address but couldn't find the right apartment within the building. There are max 3 apartments/flats in that building so I find this really surprising. The police said they will try and find them again today but I find it so strange that they couldn't find the apartment because 2 weeks ago they could. It's like the police aren't making a note of these things.

Anyway, I'm just wondering... is there anything else I can do in this situation to help? I've already recorded a couple of their fights on voice notes (the police seem to have no interest in this) and called the police twice. But if I keep hearing this woman getting abused, is there anything else I can do? Do I just keep calling the police? I fear for her safety and not to make this about me but it's extremely distressing to overhear domestic violence and feel like there's nothing I can do to help. The couple that I hear fighting speak Spanish and so do I... not sure if that's relevant but thought I'd mention it. I don't know this couple personally and I haven't even seen them. I just know they live in the building next to mine.

Thank you",domesticviolence
Am I wrong for cutting my MIL off?,"My husband is in jail for domestic violence charges from me. My MIL, his mom has been calling me selfish for having an order of protection and talking behind my back. My husbands brothers gf sent me screenshots of my MIL and the brothers conversation of her talking crap about me(the wife) and the other gf. I have always been respectful and nice to her but the comments and her talking crap is making me feel so crappy and even harder for me to move forward and heal. The screenshots really showed me the true side of her and I want nothing to do with her anymore, besides she will always take her own sons side. We have kids and she has never wanted to see them/ hangout with him up until my husband went to jail. I feel like she just comes over to get information and pretends like she understands me. I have not confronted her, and not planning on it because I feel like it’s just a waste of my energy and peace.",domesticviolence
What reason if my do they give you,"Does your Abuser ever tell you why they hit you?like what triggers them that in their head they think it’s ok?

My husband said it’s because I disrespect him with my words. I have said some things in the past but I don’t think that’s A reason. So is he going to smack everyone that disrespects him?! 

This recent incident i did disrespect him but 
After he pushed me etc. I was so Angry for what he did I told him tht I hate him and hope he dies. No excuse to say that I know trust me I know. I was so angry thinking why when we argue does he have to smack me.im tired of getting smacked or pushed 
We can’t take back words Nd I’m sorry.

[USA] DV situation with 2 kids,"TL;DR: abusive, stalker baby daddy still harassing us and im concerned for what may happen when the order is up) -read for more background but that's about it-

We are almost 2 years into the 3 year domestic violence restraining order/ sole custody to mom order granted january of 2019 (as there was a lot of physical violence). He began to physically (home and work) and cyber stalk me. I called police multiple times and made reports, they claimed they couldnt find him so it was dismissed (including a time he said I was being held captive and beat in my house to the point where a fucking police team almost knocked down my door, he got away with it). In august 2019 he summoned me to court to change the custody order, a judge denied it because he made no moves to start/finish court appointed tasks. (a 52 week batterer class and a grip of other stuff) during that hearing, I submitted a lot of evidence proving he was still a threat and none of it was addressed. After the court date, the stalking became so much I LITERALLY MOVED OUT OF TOWN for the safety of myself and my kids. All hes been doing since October 2019 is cyber stuff to which I ignore because he didnt know where I was. Got some messages yesterday from a new burner account of his. I usually just brush these off but he literally told me he worked for UPS and then told me my location, when I have made sure not to tell ANYONE. I'm constantly begging and pleading with him to leave me alone. I'm waiting on a couple calls back, so I thought I'd ask the good ol people of reddit, what can I expect out of this? I'm at the prime age of dumb fuck 19 and have no clue what to prepare myself for. Can I take this to court to prove further harassment? What good would that do me? Would this get me anywhere? God almighty, what the hell is gonna happen with my kids one this order is up? I've never thought about terminating his rights and I dont even know if its an option but considering we are almost 2 years into this and nothing has changed, I dont know what to do. I'm unsure how to post pictures on here so I'll type each text he sent (just for clarity and severity purposes-as to whether I can do anything) 

""Just so you know I'm taking care of the DV classes. We will have a court date soon. Also you're welcome for paying that child support check. You got $332 but I got 1350 and when I'm finished I'll be able to have my sons back in my life..
 -lifes looking up for me 🙏
-take care babymama send my boys lots of love and tell them daddys coming home soon
-also congrats on your new kid. Always knew youd let anyone shoot cum between your legs. I was just the unfortunate one
-see you soon
soon
-I can care less if you talk to me now
now
-I dont expect behavior from someone as immature as you
-cause you will have to deal with me now
-not trying to scare you, just a heads up
-so you can stop running from me cause you're gonna need to know the court case some how
-you created this dont be upset cause you cant clean up your mess
-you knew you could never really get rid of me
-There’s nothing you can say. I have a lady now who’s family took me in and removed the toxic dysfunctional traits that I grew up around. Showing the better way to handle things. I work for ups getting paid 28 and hour
-And the best part is I even pay my child support and that wasn’t enough for you to consider being mature
-But I’ve finally gotten shit for myself but I’ll never be complete with my sons out in *my location*  not knowing who their father is.""
He sent all that before I could even respond to one message. And any message after that is blaming me for the downfall of himself. I screen shot and screen recorded the texts as they came in. I'm so scared this is gonna go nowhere. Someone ease my mind.",domesticviolence
Hits his new girlfriend and his ex,"I don’t know if this is allowed but the police aren’t doing anything so I thought I should go to the internet for help. My friends ex was an abusive, manipulative person who cheated and hit her multiple times. The cops would only say to leave him and wouldn’t charge him with anything because they didn’t see the crime happen. Even after they broke up he stole money and some of her belongings.(some stuff because he wanted to like makeup and stuff he wouldn’t need) so all I’m ask is you text and call this pos and let him know people support his ex girlfriend! And don’t tolerate abuse! He moves to Washington from LA or we would still be trying to get the law involved. But here’s his number so feel free to call or text. Even repost please, if you know my friend and saw he face after what happened you would be f$&amp;king angry. Here’s his number (310) 850-4549 his name is chase btw",domesticviolence
My mom wishes I was never born,"I posted this in r/mentalHealth but I thought posting here might garner more specific responses

This is my first personal post to a forum like this in a really long time. I've always been made fun of and attacked for not having the textbook, loving relationship with my mom. This has made it really difficult to ask for help from anyone, as I'm used to my feelings being rejected. I'm in college now, but I've had this issue for my entire life. I live with my mom--my dad passed when I was young so its been the two of us for a really long time. She works a high-stress job and has always expected me to take school as seriously as she does her work. This means never hanging out with my friends after school if I don't want her calling and texting me a million times. If it were up to her, I'd be chained to a desk doing work 24/7 with a gag in my mouth. In middle school I was bullied to the point of self harm but she never even made an attempt to address the problem, saying that I was only 'being a baby' because I didn't want to do more work. When I told her what I was doing to myself she fully didn't believe me, calling me a pussy. I was 13. This attitude has persisted. Whenever other people are around us, she pretends as if we have this caring relationship when the reality is we really don't. She's good at acting as if it's true, so when we're at dinner with her friends and she says all these things about how hard I work all it does is make my blood boil. She calls me nicknames that she makes up on the spot and sends me looks as if she actually expects me to do the same. I'm not sure how sick in the head she is: i don't know if she actually believes that I love her or if this is all manipulation of me and her friends. The one person who's believed me is our neighbor, but even she only believed me when I was old enough for her to and when I had been telling her about the abuse for years on end. Whenever people leave the two of us alone, she goes on tirades about how I've failed her. I admit it's not just her that is nasty towards me, now that I'm older I know what she's doing is wrong and I call hr out on it. Probably not in the best ways, but I promise you I would never reciprocate the same energy she's sent my way. I've shown up to school with bruises more times than I can count and no one has ever thought twice about it or said anything to me. She's threatened me with her boyfriends and co-workers, saying that if I don't comply she's gonna get her boyfriend to beat me. People tell me I'm outgoing and confident, so I'm sure it's easy for people to laugh about the problems I have with my mom, believing that I'm exaggerating to be funny. A couple years ago I posted on socials that I got kicked out of the house on a school night in the middle of winter, and all the responses were ""haha epic"". I've convinced myself that the only reaction people will have to me talking about my mom issues is either laughter or disgust because that's been 99% of the responses. Whenever I bring up how she's treated me to her face, she denies everything. She even denies me hurting myself, she denies ever hitting me. This has driven me to the point of insanity. I know that she's never going to change so I need to find better ways of handling her. I've never had a conversation with someone who's had a similar experience but I'm hoping posting this will help me with that. I know there're people like me out there, I wish I had an easier time talking about it so that I could find them. I don't want my horrible relationship and experiences with her to carry over into other aspects of my life as I become an adult and move away. I have a really hard time dealing with her and she ruins a lot of my days. I wish I knew how to prevent her from doing this to me. I know that my anger towards her won't just go away if I move away and never respond to her, I have to process and heal. If anyone has advice on how to lessen her affect on me and how to process traumatizing childhood events I would appreciate it. Also, if there are more specific forums surrounding familial abuse I'm really looking to find support for this. Thank you",domesticviolence
Just need a space to vent,"I totally know my relationship is all wrong and pretty toxic. I've never been even particularly with a SO until I met my current one. We have been together about 4 years. 
This is a throwaway and I'll change small insignificant details to keep myself safe.

He is a little older than me but really immature. Hes so angry, all the time. The smallest things, an argument over me dropping a tiny bit of food can end up in him threatening to throw furniture at me.
I know its totally wrong. We bought a new house recently and I've had food and drink thrown over me, totally humiliating although it doesn't hurt.

I'm a stay at home worker with the stuff thats going on at the minute. He's not. I clean daily, cook everything including his meals for the night shifts he works.

But he says I do nothing. Just accuses me daily of playing on the Xbox all day (I definitely do not. 1 hour at most, or not at all). 

I'm feisty too and not one to take loads of abuse but it gets so out of hand and he either threatens me, throws things at me or breaks stuff and has hurt me before. He once pulled me round the garden by my hair and I lost chunks of it. 

So why do I feel no anger once it's done? Why am I so forgiving, and just want to love him and be loved? Cos when things are good they're awesome and about 10 mins after hes finished being like that I just want things to be fine and theres never any hard feelings on my part. I'm totally in love and just want to get on with stuff. Thats not normal is it, but I cant shake it off.

Also sometimes I feel guilty because of things I said or did when retaliating or to protect myself. I once kicked out at him because I was scared and caused a nasty bruise. Thats makes me feel like I cant tell anyone because I've done wrong too.

Why does my brain and my heart tell me I love him and to stay? Why arent I running for the hills?",domesticviolence
Police abolition and domestic abuse/stalking: question?,"Hey all! I consider myself an abolitionist when it comes to policing. I have a friend (white woman) who got out of a physically and emotionally abusive relationship (with a Black man) about a year ago. He beat her, threatened to kill her, and pulled a gun on her many times. When the relationship ended, she filed a restraining order against him; that order has now expired, but her ex continues to stalk her and try and get in contact with her. 

However, after educating herself further and in light of all that is happening right now regarding police violence and murder against Black people, she does not feel right filing for a second restraining order or reporting him to the police, or involving them at all in the matter. At the same time, she is afraid for her life and believes that he would kill her given the opportunity. I am really at a loss for what to say or how to help and despite my readings on the subject of abolition; I have no idea how to help her stay safe in the immediate present and am not sure what advice to give or what direction to point her in. Does anyone have any experience with a situation like this and have any insight to offer?",domesticviolence

I never ""had to"" stand on my own feet.
I never ""got to"" stand on my own feet.

I am now 30&lt;F and need to break any and all ties, I am going under.

She was sweet to me,"She was sweet to me.

God, was she charming. She swept me off my feet the moment we met, I don't usually fall for people 

but she had everything I liked. She was tall (6ft) and butch and I was smitten by her protectiveness and how she treated me. 

She bought me dinners (I never paid for a single thing, she wouldn't let me pay or even tip myself), jewelry, clothes, took me out, just all that kind of stuff. It was a first to me to have someone treat me so... I don't know like I was special. She made me feel special. It was ok at first. 

Then at home one day she's talking about work, complaining about something, and I made a sarcastic quip about the situation. Don't even remember what I said, next thing I know I'm holding onto the side of my face because she's smacked me across my cheek. I just kinda sat there shocked and asked 

if she really just hit me, she said she didn't mean to hit me that hard. I didn't know what to do so I just said it was ok, it was a mistake and a one time thing, we went to bed. 

My life changed after that night. She became demanding, scary, intimidating. I'm 5'3 140lbs, she was 6' and little over 300lbs, so she constantly used her large frame to back me into corners while berating me over something I said or did, restraining me if I ever tried to get away, pinning me against walls to show she was stronger than I was. Stuff like that. 

One bad night we went to a bar, I went to the patio to smoke and another woman followed me and started hitting on me, asking to buy me another drink. I was explaining I was here with someone when my girlfriend walked out and flipped the fuck out. She walked over and I guess her look or something sent the other woman scurrying away, while I began to be yelled at about being a lying, cheating whore (the usual go to). 

I was tired that night so I got up and walked away, out of the bar while figuring out how the fuck I was going to get home. She of course followed me, and I blame myself for letting her pull me into an alley. I should have stayed in view of other people. Well she screamed at me some more, wouldn't 

stop grabbing me and she finally pushed too hard and I stumbled backwards and smashed my face into the cement wall and suddenly I found myself spitting out one of my teeth as it was cracked and broken by the impact. 

I still fucking stayed. I started crying and she hugged me and apologized, we went home and I just laid in bed while she did whatever she wanted to me and waited for her to be done and fall asleep so I could just cry into my pillow. 

It became all the time. The hits became routine. Around her friends (I was not allowed to speak to my friends cause the me being a whore and all) she would make fun of me for being mentally ill, that I was so stupid I had to drop out of college, she had to take care of me, ect ect. If I said something she didn't like she'd pinch me and twist (like sitting at the table she could pretend to pat my thigh while really she was punishing me for what I said). 

She quickly learned the key was not to hit me in the face or choke me because that leaves bruises where people could see. So my chest/ribs, lower back, and legs were all fair game. 

I never realized others noticed when I was once again explaining walking awkwardly because I fell (again), or ran into a door (again), or slipped in the shower. The excuses were bullshit to everyone but they whispered to each other never asked if I was ok. 

She convinced me to get off my meds for my bipolar disorder. She told me she liked me manic 

because I was better in bed. So I stopped, my depression became worse, I was becoming more isolated and had no one to talk to, and my anxiety was at it's worst in my life.

But I didn't tell anyone what was going on. I felt like I deserved it. I hated myself, so it seemed fitting to be hit and degraded since I was so self loathing. 

Then someone did reach out. 

I got a text from an unknown person, asking if she had the right number. I said yes, who is this? 

They wouldn't tell me who they were, just they were friends with my girlfriend and they thought something was going on. She or he told me they had been in an abusive relationship in the past and every time they saw me with my partner they could see something was up. They also informed me she was making fun of me (like were teenagers not in our mid 20's) to her group of friends. 

Apparently, she would mock my depression and said I was nasty, that I threatened to kill myself if she left me, that I pulled out my hair, cut myself for attention, discussed our bedroom activities and showed pictures I had sent her sexting in the past. 

I was humiliated. But it was the last straw, I don't know what clicked but I realized I needed to get the fuck out, this needed to end now. 

So while she was at work I gathered all my things and left, went back to my parents home, and just sat in one of the bedrooms crying for hours and throwing up because I was terrified she was going to come after me. She sent me some vile texts and I eventually had to block her on everything as she was harassing the fuck out of me. 

The things I trusted her enough to tell her, like being raped as a child, was all used against me. She told anyone who would listen the things I told her in confidence. But I wasn't mad, I was numb. So what? I asked myself, I could easily disprove or correct the things she was saying so I thought screw her. 

I told my psych what had been going on and he was very supportive, told me I was worth more than someone abusing me, I didn't deserve it, he was just really nice about it. He didn't make me feel like it was my fault and that felt good. Hell, it just felt good telling someone what had been going on since I had bottled it up for over a year.

I'm back on meds now and in a lot better place than I was just three months ago. I'm working on coping with substance abuse (being drunk made being hit not hurt as badly, and I preferred being able to pass out while she used my body how she wanted in bed) and it's a struggle but without being abused and scared all the time I think I might be able to work on that now. 

I know this was a long rambling rant but I just am so bewildered why I put up with the abuse for so 

long. I'm a victims advocate, I've helped others escape abuse from partners (it's really rampant in the 

LGBT community, just not talked about as much), but I couldn't leave myself because she broke me 

down. I still think sometimes it all happened to another person, as I don't know who that person was 

who was playing the victim role.

I don't know where this is going so I'm going to end this here. Thanks for listening/reading. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to see red flags before it gets too bad? This is now the second partner in my life who has turned abusive, although this one was the worst by far, but I really feel like I am to blame since this keeps happening. 

Thanks ya'll.",domesticviolence

Trapped and Potential Prevention,"Say your sibling is growing increasingly aggressive over the last year. And that person comes to you on what has turned into a daily basis to blow off steam about parents saying stuff like I hope they die, constantly critiquing every little word said as it is a negative towards them, saying they can’t be stopped because this person has been getting in shape with the intention to fight them one day (if it comes to it), relating everything back to to parents for every mistake this person ever makes, etc. To the point I’m genuinely fearful for their lives as well as my own. 

How does one go about this situation? Would it be beneficial to have recordings of said conversations which include physical and biological warfare threats? Along with ramblings of vitriol. But not really any acts of violence yet.

Thank you and stay safe.",domesticviolence

Landlord looking for help with loud domestic violence in front yard,"Hi, I’m looking for advice on how to be an ally in this situation - even if that advice is “don’t do anything”. I am located in Missouri. 

I am a new landlord and my new tenants are generating multiple complaints from the neighbors regarding extremely loud and aggressive fights in the front yard of the house. 1 of the parties is aggressive and the other is not. Both of the parties are in the lease. 

I have not discussed with the tenants yet because I don’t know how. This type of disturbance may violate provisions of the lease that call for “quiet enjoyment of the neighbors”, although I feel strongly that attempting to evict the whole household would be harmful to the victim. 

What should I do now? Open to all suggestions, thank you for your time.",domesticviolence
Being used as a punching bag for my sister,"My younger sister (I’m 24F and she’s 19) starting going to an MMA gym 3 years ago and she started hurting me shortly after that. We live together in the same house and she does it all the time. A list of just some of the things she’s done to me:

-dislocated my shoulders. 
-broke my ankle. 
-broke my ribs by kicking me. 
-punched my chest and collapsed my lung. 
-punched my stomach hard enough to make me throw up.
-wrecked my face (with punches and knees) left me with bleeding lips, swollen eyes.

I would say that she beats me up at least once a week. It just happens at random and I keep saying I’m sorry but I don’t even know what I did wrong. I hardly eat now, because of how she hurts my stomach. I’m 6’1 and I barely weigh 122 (used to be about 155 before this started). I have no energy and I’m desperately hungry all the time. When I beg her to stop she says that because of how tall I am, I should be able to take the beatings. I have a boyfriend and he just laughed me off and said the same thing, that my sister is so much smaller than me so she can’t be hurting me that bad. My mom who’s house we live in says the same thing and laughs at me for complaining. When I had to go to the hospital for all those injuries she just said that my sister was being a little rough and didn’t mean any harm. The thing is, she hits me so hard. It really hurts and it leaves me in pain for days afterward. I’m so tired of being in pain and being hungry and feeling sick and all the rest of it.",domesticviolence
It never ends,"Feeling pretty low, thought I'd post.

My wife was on the downhill of an abusive marriage when we met.  Initially we were just friends, but I made her feel better, so she could take more of his abuse but also stand up for herself more.  He had stopped being physically violent by that point, he's 6'3 265+, so for him it was more verbal and punching walls or threats since he had established he could best her up anytime he just had to remind her.

She hid most of it, but I became a huge issue for them and I got used to him calling to threaten me ect once she grew numb.

Fast forward a few years, she left, eventually we got married, good times.  But they had joint custody and he started back up, screaming at her (after convincing  her she couldn't record), threatening and intimidating ect.  It escalated into stalking while I was deployed and that's when she finally told me the whole history and it clicked just how violent he could get.  Cops wouldn't take it seriously (NC isn't too progressive), and I started learning how little the system knows about its own laws.  I got smarter, but it takes FOREVER to build a case on someone who now knows they are being watched, dozens of reports, cops know him it's just waiting for a big blowup now.  The assumption is I'm here to protect her now, problem is they also tell me how fast I'll get arrested for doing it.

Brings us to today.  We show up to drop her daughter off, in the police station parking lot like always.  Ex gets out with his mom.  Daughter walks over to grandma, they go to get in his van.  He's still standing there.  I say nothing, no eye contact, wait until my wife is in the car, and as I'm getting in he starts coming towards us.  I pull out my phone, start trying to record and he starts bowing up saying he wants to fight ect.  She's yelling how rediculous this is, tells me to just go.  His mom grabs him, we pull off.

Wife doesn't stop yelling though because......

SHE IS YELLING AT ME!!! 

Now shes mad because she thinks I instigated it.  Same guy that called to cancel her daughters counseling appointment yesterday, same guy who immediately started blowing her phone up about me today being there, like I always am, on and on.

She knows he's dangerous and violent, and uses any excuse to not let their daughter call (1 call on his time a month, maybe) but when does reality set in for her that what he's doing is controlling and he wants to isolate her, so trying to get along with him is a no win game.  He has repeatedly tried to lure her out alone for various reasons and even shown up at times when he doesn't think I'll be there.

It feels some days like I can't win.",domesticviolence
6 months later,"It has been 6 months since I left an emotional, sexual, and physically abusive relationship. I still have trouble sleeping at night after taking sleeping medications.

I don’t know what to do it seems like every day it just gets worse and I can’t make it go away.

I now live in a healthy safe home but I still can’t get over what happened. Does anyone have anything that helped them sleep after being abused?

Cannot Afford a divorce,"Hello, I am a seventeen year old living in a house with two parents, a sister, and a dog., United States

My father has been emotionally abusing my mother for a while now, with offs and ons, but it always resorts back to him emotionally abusing my mother. I do not wish to go into much detail, but everyone in my family (mother, myself, sister) have politely told our father how he constantly emotionally abuses my mother. At this point, it is impossible to speak to him, as no matter what you will say, no matter how polite, any constructive criticism you give him will result in him blaming you for ""attacking"" him. He will constantly start screaming at my mother when she is asking questions that a normal wife would ask her husband, like ""Hey I saw you went out for a bit, where did you go?"" in the politest, kindest manner possible. No matter what she does, says, anything, he screams at her constantly.

My family is in the lower middle class. We live in an apartment that is by far the cheapest in my area, and we cannot afford to separate. My mother works tirelessly at her job throughout the day, only to have to clean the house, clean up my father's messes, deal with his emotional abuse, care for her children. There are little opportunities for different places that we can move into. My sister is in college, and it is already hard enough to pay for that, let alone move out and go through all of the costs to do that. Since school is currently online due to COVID-19, internet is a necessity and that threatens to go away based on its cost. 

My father cannot be trusted with money. As a child, I would obtain birthday and Christmas money, and I would often save it up for years at a time, just for my father to ""borrow"" hundreds of dollars and never pay it back. He is an untrustworthy, lying, quick-to-anger, self-centered, emotionally abusing man.

Another problem is our dog. We were lucky enough to make an agreement with our landlords to even have a dog in the first place, and it will be hard to find a place that will allow dogs. We would also need to be able to afford to move our stuff.  We will also be paying for my college after next year.

We do not know what to do.",domesticviolence
How to have a conversation with your abuser,"Hello, I am 21 and am thinking of how to have a conversation with my once physically and emotionally abusive father. This is not to say he still isn't abusive because he is, it just isn't nearly as often. It might be once a year or so.

He has beaten me, my mother, and my siblings. Mainly when we were younger but once we got older we would always step in to defend our mother and we would just kind of get hit because we were in the middle. My sister claims that he has denied that I ever even experienced any of his abuse. However, everything is so real and I was there and endured his abuse for my whole childhood. He also drinks a lot and got arrested for drunk driving last year. However, he is a functioning alcoholic and never misses a day of work because of it. He is our main provider and always has been, but in the past, he has used that to his advantage by threatening us if we ever called the police. 

I do love him. and I care for him and I want him to apologize and sincerely mean it. I am just not sure how to address this or have a conversation with him about the way his abuse has made me feel. Our family has never had this conversation. It's as if we always ignore the fact that he would become a monster at night and terrorize our home. Many nights that felt like a complete nightmare due to his actions. I don't know how to approach the situation or if speaking to him about this and expecting an apology is unrealistic.",domesticviolence
Cannot Afford a divorce,,domesticviolence
How ABA conditioned me to be abused and raped- TW for rape," I was born in 1995 to a very young married couple. My infancy was good; I was held a lot by my parents and my mom stayed home all day with me. Both of my parents have said I was a very happy and giggly baby and a joy to be around. This was all going to change, however.

When I was a year old, we got evicted from our apartment and moved in with my grandparents. My parents’ marriage crumbled and my dad had to move out. He looked at me sleeping in my crib that day, knowing he had to leave, expecting to never see me again. Through my childhood I was told my dad didn’t want to raise me anymore and it was also implied to be due to me being diagnosed with Autism.

I was diagnosed with Autism and put through ABA inspired therapies in order to function as normally as possible. My grandmother especially pushed me to make eye contact and let people hug me, no matter how I felt. I couldn’t appear to be a rude child to anyone she knew, so I let people do it. 

When I was in after school daycare, I was told by the workers that I had to share my toys with other children. It went as far as the workers allowing other children to take stuff from me/not punishing them if they did.

By the time I got to my teen years, my grandmother was still washing me in the bath when I stayed over. I had been pushing her to let me bathe on my own since I hit puberty but she refused to allow it. She thought that due to my Autism, I was incapable of bathing. She used the same rationale to justify dressing me and helping me into bathing suits long after I was capable.

I got involved with two internet predators, both of whom consumed my life. Both of them would require me to keep in constant contact, preventing me from developing a social life. 

I dated a man whose mother was especially abusive towards me. She would yell at me, threaten me, and treat me like a small child. Her son rarely ever defended me against her and often said I deserved it.

My next partner was no better. We were long distance and he was sexually aggressive very early on, demanding that I send him sexual pictures. This eventually became videos, which had to happen weekly minimum. He used sex as a punishment for any and all infractions. If I said the wrong thing, took too long coming home, or didn’t tell him about a purchase I made, he would punish me by forcing me to get naked over Skype. I would be forced to finger myself or do whatever he told. I had to inflict pain on myself for his own pleasure.

I visited him last year and his attitude towards me changed. A couple days into the visit, he got angry with me for fidgeting too much in my sleep. He spent the morning yelling at me and then apologized. He took me out for coffee to try to “repair our bond”

A few days later, I went to bed at around 2 in the morning. He was still awake so he continued to watch TV for another few minutes. He eventually came to bed and started touching me while I was trying to sleep. He felt me up under my clothes and tried to have sex with me, despite me trying to sleep. I asked him to please stop and told him I wanted to sleep. He said no and continued to touch me, also starting to remove my clothes. I started to cry and pleaded with him to stop. He got angry with me and told me to go into the bathroom. I got up and sat on the floor in his bathroom for probably 20 minutes until he grabbed me and pushed me to his bed.

Once he got me to the bed, he said he was going to give me something to cry about. He pushed me down and pulled my bottoms off. He forced himself inside me and thrusted as hard as he could. I asked him to please stop but he continued even harder. He continued for around 15 to 20 minutes as I cried, frozen. He suddenly stopped and apologized. I stayed unable to move until I coaxed myself into pulling my pants up. He said he would never do it again and I just lay there, still frozen. I did not sleep well that night.

On another occasion, we got into an argument. After yelling at me and telling me I was nothing but an arrogant brat, he placed his hands on my neck. He pressed down and choked me for a minute. Not long enough for me to lose consciousness, but long enough to let me know who was in charge. I knew then he could kill me if he wanted to.

I am pleased to say I am doing better now. My rapist and I have split up and I am now with a lovely man. He knows about all of my trauma and never uses it against me. Now, when I cry, instead of being told I’m stupid or spoiled, I get cuddles and love. My boyfriend allows and encourages me to go for walks, to have friends, etc. He’s been there through the hard times and the easy times. I am slowly learning to trust him and feel loved.",domesticviolence
Should I stay or go?,"I am F20 and live with my two parents who are highly emotionally manipulative and toxic to each other. I'm in a situation where from the time I was born up until I was around 16, my dad was heavily physically abusive to me, my mom, and my little brother. When I say that, I mean fits that lasted upwards of three to six hours where he would throw all of us against walls, grab our jaws so hard that it hurt to eat for several days, pull our hair, throw us on the floor and kick us, tackle us to the floor, jump on top of us and scream and spit in our face, and at times, beat our bodies with his fists. I was constantly hiding bruises at school, I remember at least one occasion where my mom hid her black eye with sunglasses from the repairman fixing our sink, and oftentimes I the abuse was so heavy I thought my dad might not realize his own strength and would accidentally kill me. I lived in constant terror.

As you can imagine, I was heavily traumatized as a kid. To make matters worse, my parents also raised me in an extremely strict religious cult, and because of the rules (particularly regarding clothing &amp; appearance), I was heavily mocked, bullied, and rejected at school and nearly every other social situation I have ever been in. When I was 12, my parents pulled me out of school because I was cutting myself (I didn't do this for attention; I did it on my thighs, which were covered at all times even in the summer due to the dress code rules, but my mom walked in on me changing), and they thought the bullying was the cause of it. Basically, they homeschooled me, except they both worked full time, so I was pretty much left alone in the house, and nearly the only social situation interaction I got until I began college was when I went to the cult church, where most of the people were mean and bullied me.

During my childhood years, my mom took 24 hours a semester and rushed to get 8 yrs of school done in 3.5 yrs, along with several certifications. What I watched her go through was brutal and intense; I watched her have so many meltdowns getting through all that school while raising my brother and I, but she was scared it might get to a point that she would have to flee for our lives, and she was terrified she wouldn't be able to support us. She went from having a few hours at a community college from years ago to being a highly educated professional and working as a controller, and making a decent amount more financially than my dad does. When that happened, she stood up to him and stopped the hours long fits and physical abuse.

Basically, I'm in a situation where the physical abuse and emotional manipulation, the years of isolation, and the bullying have created a cocktail where I'm struggling to be mentally stable, though I've mostly dealt with this by being a perfectionist. I was not educated well during the years I was isolated, however, I was already so far ahead because my parents had high standards and began teaching my brother and I upper level math in elementary, so I was able to get into community college early and didn't struggle with math until I hit pre-cal. I was always made to read a lot, too, so I tended to excel in the non-math courses. As a youth, to cope with my pain, I embraced the fantasy of being perfect, and I ended up doing things like getting up at 4 AM to work out amd teaching myself to speak a second language fluently. However, I struggle with bulimia, it's better now, but it was horrible for years, I have really bad OCD and compulsions, and while I got on Lexapro for the first time in February and it's absolutely changed my life, all the flashbacks and things I'm dealing with still make it really hard to cope.

Anyway, my parents are better now that my dad doesn't physically abuse me, but my parents are still heavily emotionally manipulative and it takes a toll on me. Tonight, they yelled at me for something I never said for five hours; I'm not exaggerating. I begged them that I just wanted to go; I'm always respectful to them. They literally ran around the room, threw things like a chair and a dip machine, my mom threw two iron weights against the floor so hard they broke, they screamed at the top of their lungs, and all of the emotional manipulation and twisted logic was just a lot. Now that I'm on anxiety meds and my boyfriend has come into my life and has actually pointed out bow twisted their logic is and validated my feelings/assured me that their insults to me are unfounded, I cope better, but it still hurts, and tonight left me so exhausted and drained. I cried to the point I was dehydrated. 

But, my problem is, back to my perfectionism, I set my sights on medical school a few years ago because I thought it would give me self worth, but I've actually come to love medicine. I'm going to be a senior after I finish my summer classes, I've gotten through most of the more difficult classes and have a high GPA, and with all the research I've done on GPA, the MCAT, ECs, etc., I genuinely believe I'll be able to get in. My parents are very financially generous, and they're paying for everything, including my education (even though I try to offer to pay for things, they won't let me). My mom is extremely controlling; she called my boss a month after I was fired for something minor where a lot of other employees agreed the boss had it out for me, but it was whatever, and chewed the boss out. That humiliated me. The idea of a parent calling their nearly 21 year old child's boss a month after that child was let go is so inappropriate and embarrassing, but both parents believe that's their right as parents because they pay the bills. My mom found out I lost my virginity last year, and she is mad I haven't apologized to her for that. I lied and said I only had sex with my boyfriend one time and am not sexually active, but she treats my boyfriend like trash now and hates him even though he's an amazing guy, and she loved him before she knew that. She was extremely angry when she found out I was in his bedroom this weekend, even though it was daytime and his parents were right outside in the living room. She questions me on everything, her control exhausts me. I spend several hours a day doing chores, I'm highly responsible, don't drink, smoke, use drugs, etc., am very respectful and don't back talk, but she will not stop seeing me as a child.

So, I have one year left until I'm done with my bachelor's. I'm scared my GPA might drop if I have to work full time while I'm taking classes like O-Chem 2, and I also need to study for the MCAT. The fact that they're paying for everything, and I don't have to pay my own way makes it easier to shadow, research, etc. I'm already on the home stretch, and I know that if by some chance I didn't get into medical school, I'd be stuck with a biology degree I can't do a lot with, and I'd have to give up my dream. I don't know what to do. It sounds silly that I legitimately fear they might beat me again some day. I keep my phone with me, so I can call 911 if that were to happen. I hate having that kind of fear in my own house. But I'm so scared of striking out on my own and not getting in and being screwed.

What would you all do in this situation? Try to hold out and keep a phone close by in case anything happens? I don't think my life is in danger, but I do think I could be decently injured (I don't predict it, but it wouldn't surprise me). They put their hands on me forcefully now, especially my mom, but they don't abuse me. Are there options where I could move out and get into medical school, too? Could I take out loans? My parents have access to my bank account and would take that, my phone, and my car. I'm going to start my own bank account for my next job and hope they don't say anything, but if I were to strike out right now, I'd essentially have nothing to my name. Help...",domesticviolence
Is this what I think it is?,"Abuse basically. 

This morning I started a probably unwarranted argument about something that was getting to me. I was honest with how I felt about the situation. I talked exclusively about how I felt not how he made me felt. I feel this is an important difference.

Anyway he blew up big time and said the following things. I’m struggling to digest and this is not the first time he has said some of these things (if not some other really worse things in the past)

Please help me to process and to see a way. I’m struggling.

Need some advice for talking about domestic abuse as an outsider who has never experienced it myself or had a conversation about it before,"My gf &amp; mother have just had their whole lives uprooted and forced to move across country to get away from her abusive brother after he attempted to kill himself. 

He was emotionally, physically, financially and spiritually abusive towards both of them from a young age (12, he is now 20). He suffers from being bipolar, manic depressive which often result mood swings and violent outbursts and also addiction issues with drugs and alcohol. 

Late last year they were both forced to kick him out of their home and put a restraining order on him after one of his outbursts, where he pushed my SO through the conservatory door, nearly bringing the door down on top of her. He had at that point also punched several holes in the plasterboard of their home and threatened both her and her mother physically and self-harmed i89with a piece of glass in front of them. It got to the point where the police were called and he had to be arrested and detained for 24 hours. 

I also am aware that whilst living with them, he stole from his mother and her continuously and was very controlling around his mothers comings and going.

This isn't the only outburst there has been where something like this has happened and not the first time he has made an attempt on his life. 

I don't know if its worth mentioning but the father has never really been around. Their mother and he divorced when my gf and her brother were very young and never really made an effort to be in their lives afterwards, only seeing them every few months, turning up drunk, or leaving them alone to go to the pub, drug addictions, and generally just being a spiteful and mean person, etc.

Im trying to be there for both of them as best as i can but I've never had this conversation before and know very little about the topic. I've done some research myself already but there's so much out there that i don't know where to begin. Could anyone send me some links to useful articles or sites or ted talks?

Tl;dr: send me all of your useful information about surviving domestic abuse and how to talk it so i can help my gf and her mum.",domesticviolence
Am I at risk here or just overreacting? (Long),"I have been in lockdown with a housemate ('Alex') for over 2 months now. Alex has been having really loud arguments with their partner ('Taylor'), has been screaming at them, crying, shouting abuse at them, and often throws things. They have since taken a 'relationship break' - Alex and Taylor are still talking but are not broaching emotional topics that could lead to arguments or having sexual discussions. They agreed that they are no longer 'dating' but may revisit a relationship once they can see each other in person again, but also provided some caveats that Alex work on their emotional regulation and Taylor work on their communication.

Alex had been listening to love songs on repeat, looking through old photos, and hasn't been doing any of the work they promised to do on their emotions. They have stated that they can't help their trauma or what triggers them, and they believe that allowances should be made for them. Alex asked for my advice, and I gave it honestly - saying that relationships require compromise and triggers (while valid) can sometimes be irrational. Alex told me that one of their triggers was being controlled, which means they can never compromise. I agreed that controlling behaviour isn't good in a relationship. But I added that if a friend asks you to change something that upsets them, and it doesn't cause too much of an issue for you, it makes sense to try and change that for that friend. (Thinking in my head that Taylor has asked Alex to stop referring to them as derogatory names such as 'b*tch', 'd*ck', and others which are too offensive to type here.) Alex appeared to agree with me and even did some work and chatted to their therapist about it (over video chat).

A few days ago, Alex had a friend sitting outside on the street and we were all having socially distanced drinks. Alex got a bit drunk (on second drink?) and interrupted Alex's friend mid-sentence to shout at me: ""We need to stop this narrative that Alex can't have healthy relationships!"" (Yes referring to themselves in the 3rd person is common.)

It came out of nowhere. I was in the middle of paying for dinner which Alex had chosen and been all to happy to have me pay for.

Me: ""I'm sorry what are you talking about?""

Alex: ""You saying that I can never have healthy relationships is hurtful and unhelpful and it needs to stop!""

Me: ""I never said that you couldn't-""

Alex: ""I don't care. That's what it felt like and it hurts and it needs to stop!""

Me: ""But I never said that and I don't think that. I just said compromise is needed in a relationship. I am not validating what you think I said when I didn't say that and don't think that at all.""

Alex: ""I DON'T CARE!!!! YOU NEED TO STOP!!""

Alex's friend interrupts this and says that we shouldn't have this conversation while drunk. Alex takes a while to calm down but then talks to their friend while I'm sat feeling really afraid and still ordering and paying for dinner.

Alex's friend leaves and Alex goes upstairs and starts shouting on the phone to someone upstairs.

I'm quite afraid because Alex has thrown things at me and 'play hit' me a few times when frustrated (not hard enough to bruise but hard enough to hurt). I had a serious chat with Alex every single time and they keep pushing the boundary, like throwing things at the wall next to my head instead of at me. I've seen how loud and shouty Alex can get while upset, and I know it won't hurt me physically but I don't want to be screamed at or have things thrown at me. I also am concerned that Alex thinks that how what people say makes them feel matters more than what they said (this was a common theme with their arguments with Taylor too) so if I do try and talk about it Alex might not understand what I'm saying or get really really angry at me.

It escalated today. I spoke to my sister at 3pm in my closet in my bedroom and Alex apparently overheard? I've been sat in the living room all evening working on my laptop, when I went in the next room to take a call from my other sister.

Alex messaged me: Hey gal, if you’re going to have calls about me you’ll need to either go elsewhere to have them or keep your voice down And also if you need to move out then go ahead

Me: I'm talking about graduation photos?

Alex: Earlier you weren't.  I don’t know or care what you’re talking about now

Me: Okay

Alex:  But earlier really upset me, and instead of stewing I’m going to tell you  And tell you in future not to say hurtful things so loudly 

Me: I'm actually good thanks. Cool will do.

Alex: *thumbs up*

It turns out that Alex asked Taylor if anyone would have reason to be scared of Alex getting violent when angry or upset and Taylor had to remind Alex that Taylor had been hit, slapped, and had things thrown at them when Alex was upset. But that doesn't seem to be the answer Alex was looking for.

long distance boyfriend is being abused,i have a long distance boyfriend living about 400 miles away in another country. i recently found out that his father physically abuses him and occasionally his dog. he’s not old enough to leave the house yet and i’m not sure what i can really do since i’m not in the same country. he isn’t taking it seriously since he’s used to it and it’s been happening since he was a child. is there anything i can do to help him?,domesticviolence
Should i report him,"My husband has smacked or pushed me. This week he pushed me And I fell really hard and the floor was wet. He pushed me once so i threw a bottle water at him. Then everything happened so fast I don’t remember too much I do remember him grabbing and pushing me again . My son helped me up I had scratch on my face and neck . My phone cracked my thumb hurt and my wrist. Later I found a bruise on the back of my arm. I discovered it because I was in pain the next morning

My son said the scratch from my face must be because when he came in I was on the table. Not A big table ,those little ones you use in the living room to eat.

I dont know if I should report it. I cslled today the police station  and was told I can report it anytime time.

Sorry for the format but my phone is cracked and not working well. 

I know it’s my decision but I don’t know what todo. He said he’s leaving but he has no where to go. I do want him out he tried to hug me the next day but this isn’t the first time . I know i did wrong by throwing a water bottle . There’s no excuse for that ! I know.

I didnt accept his apology because he’s done it before and I’m confused how he saw me on the floor my son had to help me up while I was crying with scratches and it didn’t click “ i messed up“ that hurt as well .

Idk if i should report it",domesticviolence
For my senior film I made an animation based on my experience with domestic abuse from my family. Please give it a watch! (more details in the comments),,domesticviolence
The time I finally broke and nearly killed my sister,"**My older sister was my abuser.**


It started small I guess. When I was really young we were like normal, hateful siblings. She would call me names. I would do things to spite her. I guess that was all how it was supposed to be at the time.


Elementary school was different. My mom worked until late at night, no dad in the picture. My sister would chase me around the house and beat me. She would ridicule and insult me the moment I left my room, like some sort of obsession.


As she got older, she became increasingly hostile toward me. She would attack me and chase me to my room, where I would close the door and lock it behind me. She learned to ""pick"" those easy house knobs, so I spent a lot of my elementary school home time with one hand on the door lock and the other hand playing with legos. I vividly remember my counselor asking if my mother tried to hurt me because of the bruises on my body. Thats another story though.


When I got into middle school, she moved on from abusing me. She got into drugs and began to abuse my family instead. My possessions were stolen, scary men came in and out of the house at night and my mother was an emotionally shattered husk. I just became hateful and numb.


I guess thats a really concise way to summarize a lifetime of abuse. There is so much to say, I just wanted to get you caught up.



--------------------------
**The story you probably came for:**


I was 15. I was laying on my bunkbed listening to music on my little speaker set. My phone was connected through an aux cord. I wish that detail didnt matter.


My sister was walking around the house. I could hear the floorboards creeking. I wasnt afraid, but her presence in the house always made me have some primal sense of alertness and anxiety. I was listening to the floorboards and approximating her position in the house, something I did normally.


At some point, she came into my room. This already put me on alert - she usually avoided my room. She just came in and started looking around my room. 


She focused in on my phone and my speaker set and scowled at them. ""You have an aux cord?""


""Yeah,"" I replied, ""just one of those cheap ones so I can connect my phone"" (I was always trying to downplay and mitigate conflict)


She replied with ""I want an aux cord"", followed by an awkward silence. 


I dont know what to say. She isnt getting my aux cord. ""Yeah mom and I found it at goodwill"".


She was examining the cord. ""Mom never gets me nice things.""


I dont know what to say, again. Luckily though, she walked out of the room.


As she walks out of my room and into the hallway, I hear her continuing to speak. It sounds like she is complaining, but I cant make out what she is saying. As she walks down the hallway away from my room, she starts to get louder. It gets to a point where she is screaming something at me from the other side of the house.


I am trying to avoid conflict. I go to my door and I shut it and lock both the door and the *bolt lock* that was installed on my door to protect me from her.


I hear the floorboards again, accompanied by further loud complaints. She is walking back to my room.


She stops at my door and turns the knob. She is obviously pissed that I locked it. ""Open the door.""


I figure with the bolt lock, Im in a position of power. She can fuck right off. ""No. I'm not fighting with you. Please leave.""


She continues. ""Open. The. Door.""


""No. I'm not opening it.""


""Open the fucking door.""


I just dont reply. I tend to lock up when I dont know what to say.


There is a moment of silence. My heart is beating out of my chest.


Suddenly, **BANG**, she kicks the fucking door! Adrenaline shoots through me. She kicks the door again. ""OPEN THIS FUCKING DOOR NOW"".


I dont know what to do. I text my mom. I know she cant help. She keeps kicking the door. The door is holding great. So glad I have a bolt lock.


She stops. I feel instantly relieved. Im thinking to myself that she must have tired herself out... But I dont hear the floorboards. She hasnt left, she is still in front of the door.


Im waiting for her to leave when she starts kicking the door again. She is shouting, but I cant understand what she is saying. I can hear the wood of the door being stressed and I start panicking


I had a shotgun under my bed. It wasnt loaded. I pulled it out and I pointed it at the door. 


I shouted ""(Sister), dont fucking come in here! I have a gu-"" and the door crashes open. The bolt lock has broken right through the frame of the door, which has been splintered. My sister is standing on the other side of the door watching me


**So here I am, pointing a unloaded shotgun at my sister, hoping to use it to bluff her off. *But she takes a step forward***.


(Sister): ""What are you going to do, shoot me?"" She takes another step toward me


""Do it! Fucking shoot me, (slur)! Shoot me!"" She takes another step foward.


""(Slur) (slur)! Fucking kill me!"" Another step


Suddenly she starts sprinting at me, screaming. 


What happened is a blur in my memory, but the next thing I know, I have her pinned to the wall outside my room and the shotgun has scratched a long line in the floor from being thrown down the hallway


Adrenaline was pumping through me. My heart was beating harder than I had ever felt before. She was kicking me. I felt nothing at all. No pain. 


I grabbed her by her throat. I remember her making this terrible choking sound and scratching at her neck. With my other hand, god, forgive me, I just started beating her. I had never fought anyone, I had never thrown a real punch, I had never done anything like that.


Its hard to describe, but it felt like something primal took over. I really just started beating her. Beating her as hard as I could. She was resisting and I just pushed her against the wall harder and beat her more. I was screaming in her face. Screaming about how she was the reason my mother is suicidal, and she is the reason that I camt be happy and..


I have this image burned into my mind, I stopped hitting her for a moment and I just remember there being blood on the wall next to her face and her nose just oozing blood, and I expect to see a look of pain on her face..


.. but.. she just smiled at me. This fucking crazy, wicked, demonic smile. I felt like I was beating a literal monster. She smiled at me and I just went back to beating her. I remember her tooth cutting my finger and I remember not feeling it and just continuing to beat her.


It was the most sickening, primal feeling. It was like I lost control. It was like my body wanted her *dead*. I am not a violent person at all but this was something else entirely.


So I beat her and beat her and beat her. At some point I come to my senses and I drop her. She starts screaming the moment I release her and starts hitting my face. 


Right away, like a reflex, I tackled her back up against the wall and I just started beating her again. Again and again and again and again and again. Once again, I had this primal voice telling me to beat her until she died.


I didnt. I dropped her a second time. This time she fell on her ass. She started crying loudly and jumped out of the hallway into the kitchen and ran into her room. I could hear her crying loudly from the hallway.


I went over and picked the shotgun up off the ground and I went in my room. I sat in the corner of the room and I loaded the shotgun. I pointed it at the door and I called 911.



-----------
**Aftermath**


The police came and my mom rushed home. The police were treating it like I was the abuser to my sister - they were talking about how I was going to be charged with some kind of felony assault (dofferent rules for 'domestic violence?') and I was trying to explain myself and they just werent having it at all. 


My mom arrived and started yelling at the officers, saying I had been abused all my life and how dare they ignore that she kicked in my bolt locked door and etc.. the officers just sounded pissed that they had to take a different angle at the situation


An officer came over to me and asked me what gun I pointed at my sister. I lied to them. I told them I pointed a BB gun at my sister. I didnt. I pointed a shotgun at her.


My sister told them I threatened her with a shotgun. They said it was my word versus hers, and that if it was the shotgun, I would be charged with something or another


Well.. my mom stepped in. She said i always tell the truth and that I wouldnt have done it. She took my side even though I was lying. I could see my sister break down emotionally all over again even through her bloodied face. The police decided to go with my side of the story and literally nothing happened.


No charges. No arrest. My sister had a deviated septum and I wouldnt be blown away if i caused brain damage. But literally there were no consequences. I still dont understand why I wasnt arrested when I had obviously beat the absolute shit out of her


---------


So... Yeah. Long story I guess.


Im 21 now.. that was when I was 15. She moved out shortly after that and is dying of hepatitis in another state now. I probably should feel bad for her, but I dont. I forgive her but I dont think I will ever feel empathy for her.


Im so glad I was never charged though. That would have ruined my chances at a nursing career. I'm two years into nursing school, and despite my abuse, I think I am doing okay in life.

I probably sound all dark and edgy. Sorry guys. Im really a nice guy I think. I just cant get this out of my mind today. I think i just needed to get that memory off of my mind.

I love you guys. Thank you for reading",domesticviolence
I told my therapist about arguments with my dad,"Yesterday I told my therapist about arguments with my dad she said its domestic abuse and emotional and that she will speak to her supervisor if I give her consent. I said it's not as simple as that cos the relationship is complicated and that I don't want to just throw the word abuse around. I also said I didn't want to get anyone into trouble. She said she would approach it delicately because of these reasons. She also said she would talk to me next week and wouldn't take any action after speaking with supervisor without my consent.

I regret giving consent now. Should I email her and tell her I don't want her to speak to her?

How would I word it?

Laying here thinking about committing suicide,"Another fight. Anytime I bring up my feelings I get screamed at. He gets so angry. He wants to hit me again I know it. I see it in his face. And he says it. He wants to hit me. He hates me. He told me I am exhausting. 

We got into a fight about sex. I have a high libido. It’s been over 2 weeks. He told me we could have sex tonight. It got a little late and he told me he was tired. I was disappointed. He knew I was upset. Started screaming at me to take my clothes off or get the fuck out and go live on the street. 

I was terrified. I had to close my eyes while he was in my face yelling at me. Staring at me. Like he hates me. He told me to leave in the morning. He says I won’t because I “don’t have anyone else” and he’s probably right. I don’t have anyone else. 

I don’t know what to do. I feel so empty. I am so tired of this. He’s cheated before and gets so angry he has to reassure me it won’t happen again. So mad. About everything. He’s mad when I’m anxious or sad or upset. He constantly gaslights me. I’m just so, so sad and feel so alone. 

My best friend in the whole world, truly my soulmate, died in 2013. I wish she was here more than anything. I’m 29, 30 next month. And all I want is someone to love me. Someone who kisses me and hugs me when they get home from work. Someone who looks at me like they love me.

I can hear my neighbour being abused.,"Yesterday I called the police on my neighbours for the 2nd time in 2 weeks. In case it's relevant, I live in the UK.

The first time, I heard lots of loud yelling, screaming, and crying. It was only the woman crying. I could also hear furniture and objects moving around loudly so I called the police. They came and as far as I'm aware, they spoke to the woman (I think the man had left the apartment by the time the police arrived).

Yesterday I heard them fighting again but this time it sounded like the situation had escalated. I definitely heard someone get slapped and based on what I could hear them saying (in Spanish), it was the woman who was slapped. She kept yelling ""respect me! Don't hurt me!"" over and over. It was extremely distressing. Called the police again and within 30 minutes I could see the cop outside my neighbour's building's door. A few minutes later the policeman calls me and says nobody is opening the door but 3 second later he says ""nevermind, someone's opened up"" and that was that/

This morning the police calls me again and says that they couldn't find the apartment yesterday. They went to the right address but couldn't find the right apartment within the building. There are max 3 apartments/flats in that building so I find this really surprising. The police said they will try and find them again today but I find it so strange that they couldn't find the apartment because 2 weeks ago they could. It's like the police aren't making a note of these things.

Anyway, I'm just wondering... is there anything else I can do in this situation to help? I've already recorded a couple of their fights on voice notes (the police seem to have no interest in this) and called the police twice. But if I keep hearing this woman getting abused, is there anything else I can do? Do I just keep calling the police? I fear for her safety and not to make this about me but it's extremely distressing to overhear domestic violence and feel like there's nothing I can do to help. The couple that I hear fighting speak Spanish and so do I... not sure if that's relevant but thought I'd mention it. I don't know this couple personally and I haven't even seen them. I just know they live in the building next to mine.

Am I wrong for cutting my MIL off?,"My husband is in jail for domestic violence charges from me.

I have always been respectful and nice to her but the comments and her talking crap is making me feel so crappy and even harder for me to move forward and heal.

[USA] DV situation with 2 kids,"TL;DR: abusive, stalker baby daddy still harassing us and im concerned for what may happen when the order is up) -read for more background but that's about it-

We are almost 2 years into the 3 year domestic violence restraining order/ sole custody to mom order granted january of 2019 (as there was a lot of physical violence). He began to physically (home and work) and cyber stalk me. I called police multiple times and made reports, they claimed they couldnt find him so it was dismissed (including a time he said I was being held captive and beat in my house to the point where a fucking police team almost knocked down my door, he got away with it). In august 2019 he summoned me to court to change the custody order, a judge denied it because he made no moves to start/finish court appointed tasks. (a 52 week batterer class and a grip of other stuff) during that hearing, I submitted a lot of evidence proving he was still a threat and none of it was addressed. After the court date, the stalking became so much I LITERALLY MOVED OUT OF TOWN for the safety of myself and my kids. All hes been doing since October 2019 is cyber stuff to which I ignore because he didnt know where I was. Got some messages yesterday from a new burner account of his. I usually just brush these off but he literally told me he worked for UPS and then told me my location, when I have made sure not to tell ANYONE. I'm constantly begging and pleading with him to leave me alone. I'm waiting on a couple calls back, so I thought I'd ask the good ol people of reddit, what can I expect out of this? I'm at the prime age of dumb fuck 19 and have no clue what to prepare myself for. Can I take this to court to prove further harassment? What good would that do me? Would this get me anywhere? God almighty, what the hell is gonna happen with my kids one this order is up? I've never thought about terminating his rights and I dont even know if its an option but considering we are almost 2 years into this and nothing has changed, I dont know what to do. I'm unsure how to post pictures on here so I'll type each text he sent (just for clarity and severity purposes-as to whether I can do anything) 

""Just so you know I'm taking care of the DV classes. We will have a court date soon. Also you're welcome for paying that child support check. You got $332 but I got 1350 and when I'm finished I'll be able to have my sons back in my life..
 -lifes looking up for me 🙏
-take care babymama send my boys lots of love and tell them daddys coming home soon
-also congrats on your new kid. Always knew youd let anyone shoot cum between your legs. I was just the unfortunate one
-see you soon
soon
-I can care less if you talk to me now
now
-I dont expect behavior from someone as immature as you
-cause you will have to deal with me now
-not trying to scare you, just a heads up
-so you can stop running from me cause you're gonna need to know the court case some how
-you created this dont be upset cause you cant clean up your mess
-you knew you could never really get rid of me
-There’s nothing you can say. I have a lady now who’s family took me in and removed the toxic dysfunctional traits that I grew up around. Showing the better way to handle things. I work for ups getting paid 28 and hour
-And the best part is I even pay my child support and that wasn’t enough for you to consider being mature
-But I’ve finally gotten shit for myself but I’ll never be complete with my sons out in *my location*  not knowing who their father is.""
He sent all that before I could even respond to one message. And any message after that is blaming me for the downfall of himself. I screen shot and screen recorded the texts as they came in. I'm so scared this is gonna go nowhere. Someone ease my mind.",domesticviolence
Tried to find shelter and was told they couldn’t help,"I’ve been in a long term relationship for seven years. We were supposed to get married a few months ago, but things didn’t pan out due to everything shutting down. Like many long term relationships we have had our ups and downs. The downs were typically arguments and discussions about boundaries. I’ve worked on not sharing so much of my anxieties and they never really thought they had a problem. 

Recently they have become violent. They threw a bookshelf, some remotes and after that a wooden box down the stairs that they claimed wouldn’t had hit me. I feel overwhelmed and unsafe. 

For over two months I have tried looking for apartments with no luck in my pay bracket (everywhere I go says I don’t make enough, but I don’t qualify for assistance). Insult to injury, I was told after multiple phone calls looking for shelter that I wasn’t poor enough to get help.  I was told after being honest about the $150 I had in my bank to get a hotel. “We can’t help you till you have used all resources.” I don’t know what I am supposed to do.

I feel suicidal, and all anyone can say is, “what did you do for yourself today?” I’ve tried to get help and it’s not working.",domesticviolence
Is violence irreversible? Was her violence provoked by me?,"Is violence irreversible after it has started? Like, if it's a box that has been opened, it generally becomes worse over time?

I always had a hard time hiding my temper when I felt like my ex was stupid when I helped her with her studies. She hated herself during such times, and hated me for making her hate herself. Bad feelings became verbal arguments, and then escalated to her hitting me to let the anger out.

When I initiated the breakup, her very rare violent behaviors soon escalated into full blow. She slapped, bit, threw things at me, pushed me up against the wall, threatened to harm me and my family, and once pointed a knife at me.

I know that she probably has deep-seated problems, but I feel guilty because I feel like my constant put-downs and dissatisfactions in her and in the relationship somehow contributed to her bad mental state and behavior, or at least that's what she told me. She was very sweet and gentle in the beginning, but somehow it turned into this.

So I guess what I wanted to ask was, is the relationship irreversible and can only get worse if somehow we maintain our connection? And am I right in feeling guilty in this, or is her problem only something bigger and I had a very small part to play?

Thank you for your insights.",domesticviolence
Boyfriend of nearly 6 years pushed me into getting 2 abortions against my wishes,"Tl;dr my boyfriend 15 years older than i forced me into getting two abortions under the pretence ""we weren't ready"". I am finally good enough to the standards he set and he still strings me along
My family never knew i was pregnant.


August 2018
I told him i was pregnant. He came to the appointment and had two shots of whiskey after. Handled it well at first. Second Prenatal appointment was awkward, refused prenatal vitamins, no smiles from either of us. He always wrestled me roughly because i was getting rid of it anyway it didnt matter. Asked me why i watched what i ate because it didnt matter. Yelled at me in the regular, avoided me.


I tried to eat a lot of parsley. It didnt work. Aspirin, didnt work. ""You cant clean a house, we arent ready for a baby what would it eat, fucking roaches?"" I cleaned the house hoping maybe i would be ready. Still, no. ""We dont have enough furniture. We need our own place, you're bad at cleaning, we need more time together alone, we need to travel""

Two years later i am still with him and we have bought a house, have furniture, I have a career, we have a car, i clean more now. Seeing a roach gives me that same flashback about why i wasn't good enough to keep my baby.

October 2018 
 i had a surgical abortion at 13 weeks, we had to drive 4 hours and stay over night to make the appointment. I was terrified as i had just gotten my car back after a car accident. I begged him that maybe we could make things work- he said they wouldn't. I covered all the mirrors in the house because i couldn't stand to look at myself, started drinking, defeated alcoholism later on and he hasnt changed a bit.

February 2019 My second abortion at 6 weeks was at home with pills by his coaxing. Nothing had changed.  I told him never again.",domesticviolence
Ex Keeps Coming Into Work,"My ex mistakenly came into my workplace again he immediately left so I feel its an appropriate response. The last time he came in the store they were supposed to send a warrany for his arrest. Well, now I just want to quit the job especially when my boss was cussing at me over a flat tire. I have 2 jobs right now I could find a second job maybe elsewhere. Why put up with all the negativity when my boss disrespects me anyway- except I really do need the job. 

Area small I didn't want to work at that location but that's the only store that would hire me. I tried applying to a different store no luck.

Secondary fallout,No one really talks about the damage it does to familial relationships to be abused. My mother tends to either forget or purposefully forgets that I was abused and I’m vulnerable because of it. My brother too walked out of my life and then when my abusive relationship ended he thought that everything would go back to normal. I got used to not needing him in my life. He wants me to put more effort to make our relationship better. He tells me I pushed him out but he walked out. I just feel like a victim of my families absent- mindedness. I don’t know if it’s secondary fallout or really just a prime example of how fast people think you need to “get over it”,domesticviolence
Mental Abuse - I Need Help,"Hi there everybody,

This post isn't about me; its about my sister. 

About a year ago, my eighteen year old sister brought a guy back to my house (my moms...but still, I live here) and he was alright at first. For the first month or so, he was actually a decent person. However, after that first month, everything flipped upside down. The verbal abuse began little by little. Not knowing the true scope of this abuse - I felt bad for him. He talked about how bad of a life he had, and that he suffers from mental illness. As time went on, he would blame everything on mental illness. We found out my sister was pregnant, and it only made everything so much worse. I decided to hire him at a store I was managing, just for him to mix alcohol and Xanax while on the job, causing him to black out and literally destroy my car while running around almost naked.

I am absolutely terrified that he will put his hands on my sister already. Every night, I hear her screaming and crying, while he is yelling at her while making violent threats towards my family. When we defend my sister, she denies that anything is wrong, while he continues to threaten us in a house that he lives in for free. She refuses to let us kick him out, because that's the father of her child and he apparently took her virginity, she ""loves"" him. I dont want to repeat anything that has been said because it is very triggering. My parents have no idea what is truly going on because they're deaf and can't hear the entiee context of the arguments/abuse. I absolutely cannot handle this anymore. He is SO disrespectful towards my mom - he has even said that he cheated on her because she was signing and driving at the same time?? (She was asking directions so he could sell percocets...) We have screenshots of him threatening us. Now that the baby has been born and hes a few months old, the mental abuse continues. He threatens to take the baby across the country to his family's house on a daily basis, yet leaves my mom, the same person he talks trash about every single day, to take care of the baby while my sister suffers from post partum depression. If he ever leaves, we want to move into a place that he will never find.

What do i do? How do I get him out of the house? We are all terrified of him. 

There is so much more to the story, but I cannot think straight right now. I havent gotten more than two hours of sleep a day for weeks because of this going on.",domesticviolence
My husband keeps hitting me- I don't know what to do,"Hello, I have been in a relationship for 3 years and married for almost a year to a man. Our relationship is ugly. About a few months into dating, he hit me for the first time. I don't remember the reason why he hit me, as most of the time it is over the smallest of arguments, but it happened. I have a background of child abuse and child sexual abuse and so when he was sincerely apologetic, I forgave him. We have really beautiful highs and terrible lows. There has been countless times where he has forced me to pleasure him, and he has been too rough and would hit me really hard, and wouldn't stop when I wanted him to. He has hit me many times during arguments, and has left me bruised on countless occassions. I've been choked many times, and once he did it while we were in public and going for a walk. We were arguing over something and he started choking me so hard that i started blacking out. It was dark and there was nobody around except for people in the distance who walked past us and I pretended like nothing was happening. 

I am not a perfect person. Most of the time, I feel like I deserve it. I have a horrible tendancy to keep talking and I think out of frustration, he hits me to get his message across. I speak over him, we call each other all sorts of names, he says I disrespect him and so he hits me out of frustration. I don't know what to do. I love him. I can't see myself out of this. I come from a Muslim family and his family is Muslim too. I can't imagine going back to my parents as I am scared about what he might do. We have just had another fight where he got a knife and threatened to kill me and then kill himself. Then he grabbed his stuff and left. He took our house keys with him so I know he will be back. I have no place to go. I have a good job but he has access to all of my finances and puts my money into his own savings account so I currently have no money to move out. I want to dissappear completely. But I'm torn. I love him. I don't know what to do.",domesticviolence

I’m so sick of reliving it constantly in my head even though it’s long over.,"I’ve been no contact with my abusive ex for nearly a year, with a protective order in place. I’m safe. But some days I just sit here ruminating and reliving everything that happened and I just want it be out of my head.

I wish I could get my memory erased. I’m sick of thinking about him pinning my down, kicking me, telling me how disgusting and ugly I was. Telling me no one would ever put up with me. That I’m a psychopath and I’m lucky that he loved me. Threatening suicide every time I left. Crying in front of police officers. Leaving my work and seeing his car sitting there waiting for me. Just KNOWING there a verbal and physical assault waiting for me. Seeing him walking into the bar I was at and getting embarrassed in front of everyone. I was told everyday that I was fat, stupid, unlovable, white trash, unintelligent and there was always someone better than me, someone who he could “get with.” I spent so many nights laying awake wondering if I’d see the sunrise. I’d try to just sleep and he’d rip off the blankets and kick me onto the floor.

I didn’t fucking deserve any of it. I’ve tried to work through everything in therapy. But day after day I find myself reliving the trauma, and feeling seething anger and a desire for some sort of penance or revenge. Every silver Aveo I see, I tense up, worried it’s him. I just want to forget. I don’t want to live the rest of my life hating someone and having them take up so much space in my brain. I want every thought to just go away.",domesticviolence
"Lived through 7+ years of domestic abuse from a family member, need a way out...","Been resisting the urge to post, trying to keep this as vague as possible as to lessen the chances of the bastard in question finding this, as unlikely as it is due to them not using reddit and being somewhat tech illiterate... rather not have him finding out, though i don't fear for my life and i doubt he could do anything serious besides power grabbing moves, it's been mostly verbal abuse with little physical abuse but i can't rest properly until he's gone, i need a way out of this with how often he explodes into verbal abuse...

&amp;#x200B;

I'm an adult, age 19+ with no idea how to get out of this mess, i don't fear him as much as i hate him, but i can't seem to get an opportunity to get evidence against him, and if law enforcement is around, he plays calm until out of the area if he was in an episode... any attempt to get evidence has usually passed before i can do anything, rest of the family doesn't seem to want to/have the ability to do anything about it, so it seems like it's on me to do something instead... any suggestions would be much appreciated... i feel like the opportunity has passed to get him enough to keep him away, but i guess that's why i'm here, i hope the first part doesn't take away from the seriousness of the situation... money isn't exactly easy to come by and being in a situation where you're cooped up inside your home isn't helping... and unfortunately for me and the family i care about, mother and siblings, he's smart enough not to do it if there's a camera within line of sight to him...",domesticviolence
Anyone have an abuser say it was self defense?,"Hey. New here.
Has anyone had a partner that slapped and or hit them and then said it was ok because it was self defense? It clearly wasn't and I think she is just telling herself whatever story she needs to feel ok with giving me a black eye etc.

Yes, I yelled and yeah, I broke my own things. Example: my little acoustic guitar.

I'm at a loss of what to do with my life,"24f

Without going into too much detail I'm a citizen of a country that opresses women and living in a country that opresses women. My father makes being a woman even harder with his strict religious rules and beliefs. I have been raised to be submissive while my whole being shouts for me to escape but I don't see how.

If i ever said where i lived no one would touch me with a 10 foot pole because there is nothing that can be done that will make my situation better in this country. Only a miracle would change my situation.

There is no support for abused or opressed woman in this country

I don't know how to escape or where to escape.

While I have no physical marks or bruises my inside is filled with the scars of emotional and physiological abuse. I need help but no where to turn to, no one to go to, no one to support me, no one who would listen.

Will I stay opressed my whole life? What's the point of living a life like that? I don't see any light at the end of the tunnel. It's dark all around",domesticviolence
Finally seeing the abuse as they really were.,"I have been out of the relationship for one whole month. Well, we are still texting a few times daily, so I am not technically out of the relationship yet, and perhaps won't for some time. However I am gradually starting to see the abusive patterns in our relationship, and view things as they really were.

I wasn't really wrong when I felt frustrated she couldn't understand it when I explained programming concepts to help her study. I always tried my best to constrain the frustration when teaching her, but she would always pick it out and lash out at me in return. I realize that I wasn't wrong when I repeatedly told her I was having doubts about the relationship, it was an attempt of open communication and it wasn't a sin, or that I was putting her down and deliberately making her feel inadequate. I wasn't really wrong when I wanted out, despite the fact that she followed me to a new country when I gave her a sort of ultimatum (""If you don't come to Canada, we'll have to break up."").

She is trying to layer all these guilt upon me, and even now, I still feel guilty and responsible for the above things I did.

I went back to the island one week ago, because I missed her like hell. I missed her so much that my heart felt weak and my hands trembled. It is funny, how I had been pondering breakup for the majority of the day, but ever since I really went out, I could miss her so much. My emotional dependence on her was undeniable. Every day she waited for me in front of the fireplace. She used to be so happy when I returned, and she would care about my life and health, cook for me, and listen to all the silly and the most out-of-the-world things I had to say. I missed having someone always there for me.

But the bad times, oh they were so bad. Her opinion of me shifts drastically during those episodes where she felt she wasn't ""understood."" She gaslights me (""No I haven't said that"", ""no I didn't do it"", blatantly tells me that my feelings are unimportant to her, tells me I am too needy, that all my future partners will cheat on me because of that, says that me and all my family are psychopaths, and that I won't have any achievements in life, that my pouring out my heart to her made her feel speechless, etc. That I am selfish, fake and have a weak soul.

The days pending the breakup which I initiated were the worst. She blamed me for all her problems, and accused me of not caring about her at all. She slapped, choked, kicked, bit, threw things at me, pushed me up against walls, and once pointed a knife at me. She would stand in front of my room at night with ""that look,"" refused to let me sleep and gave me verbal threats for half an hour, sitting at my bed and staring at the wall. In the daytime she kept talking to herself. I was so scared.

She is normal at most times and in front of others, especially now which is weeks after I left. I know she misses me as well, but not to such an extent as I missed her. She easily closes off her emotions, as she herself said, and according to articles of personality disorders. She would think of me randomly during the day, but I guess that's basically it.

I realize that it's going to be an uphill battle, perhaps filled with loneliness, but also filled with freedom. I know that going back to the island where I used to, and somewhat still, feel like it's a home, isn't the answer to all this. Last time I went, I relived the sweetest times, but then triggered one of her episodes and got slapped, blamed and threatened in return. I won't contemplate going back to her again. She is not likely to change in the following months and even years to come.

This is what I have been thinking about today, and I am posting this out to share with you all.",domesticviolence
It never ends,"Feeling pretty low, thought I'd post.

My wife was on the downhill of an abusive marriage when we met.  Initially we were just friends, but I made her feel better, so she could take more of his abuse but also stand up for herself more.  He had stopped being physically violent by that point, he's 6'3 265+, so for him it was more verbal and punching walls or threats since he had established he could best her up anytime he just had to remind her.

She hid most of it, but I became a huge issue for them and I got used to him calling to threaten me ect once she grew numb.

Fast forward a few years, she left, eventually we got married, good times.  But they had joint custody and he started back up, screaming at her (after convincing  her she couldn't record), threatening and intimidating ect.  It escalated into stalking while I was deployed and that's when she finally told me the whole history and it clicked just how violent he could get.  Cops wouldn't take it seriously (NC isn't too progressive), and I started learning how little the system knows about its own laws.  I got smarter, but it takes FOREVER to build a case on someone who now knows they are being watched, dozens of reports, cops know him it's just waiting for a big blowup now.  The assumption is I'm here to protect her now, problem is they also tell me how fast I'll get arrested for doing it.

Brings us to today.  We show up to drop her daughter off, in the police station parking lot like always.  Ex gets out with his mom.  Daughter walks over to grandma, they go to get in his van.  He's still standing there.  I say nothing, no eye contact, wait until my wife is in the car, and as I'm getting in he starts coming towards us.  I pull out my phone, start trying to record and he starts bowing up saying he wants to fight ect.  She's yelling how rediculous this is, tells me to just go.  His mom grabs him, we pull off.

Wife doesn't stop yelling though because......

SHE IS YELLING AT ME!!! 

Now shes mad because she thinks I instigated it.  Same guy that called to cancel her daughters counseling appointment yesterday, same guy who immediately started blowing her phone up about me today being there, like I always am, on and on.

She knows he's dangerous and violent, and uses any excuse to not let their daughter call (1 call on his time a month, maybe) but when does reality set in for her that what he's doing is controlling and he wants to isolate her, so trying to get along with him is a no win game.  He has repeatedly tried to lure her out alone for various reasons and even shown up at times when he doesn't think I'll be there.

It feels some days like I can't win.",domesticviolence

Cannot Afford a divorce,"Hello, I am a seventeen year old living in a house with two parents, a sister, and a dog., United States

My father has been emotionally abusing my mother for a while now, with offs and ons, but it always resorts back to him emotionally abusing my mother. I do not wish to go into much detail, but everyone in my family (mother, myself, sister) have politely told our father how he constantly emotionally abuses my mother. At this point, it is impossible to speak to him, as no matter what you will say, no matter how polite, any constructive criticism you give him will result in him blaming you for ""attacking"" him. He will constantly start screaming at my mother when she is asking questions that a normal wife would ask her husband, like ""Hey I saw you went out for a bit, where did you go?"" in the politest, kindest manner possible. No matter what she does, says, anything, he screams at her constantly.

My family is in the lower middle class. We live in an apartment that is by far the cheapest in my area, and we cannot afford to separate. My mother works tirelessly at her job throughout the day, only to have to clean the house, clean up my father's messes, deal with his emotional abuse, care for her children. There are little opportunities for different places that we can move into. My sister is in college, and it is already hard enough to pay for that, let alone move out and go through all of the costs to do that. Since school is currently online due to COVID-19, internet is a necessity and that threatens to go away based on its cost. 

My father cannot be trusted with money. As a child, I would obtain birthday and Christmas money, and I would often save it up for years at a time, just for my father to ""borrow"" hundreds of dollars and never pay it back. He is an untrustworthy, lying, quick-to-anger, self-centered, emotionally abusing man.

Another problem is our dog. We were lucky enough to make an agreement with our landlords to even have a dog in the first place, and it will be hard to find a place that will allow dogs. We would also need to be able to afford to move our stuff.  We will also be paying for my college after next year.

We do not know what to do.",domesticviolence
How to have a conversation with your abuser,"Hello, I am 21 and am thinking of how to have a conversation with my once physically and emotionally abusive father. This is not to say he still isn't abusive because he is, it just isn't nearly as often. It might be once a year or so.

He has beaten me, my mother, and my siblings. Mainly when we were younger but once we got older we would always step in to defend our mother and we would just kind of get hit because we were in the middle. My sister claims that he has denied that I ever even experienced any of his abuse. However, everything is so real and I was there and endured his abuse for my whole childhood. He also drinks a lot and got arrested for drunk driving last year. However, he is a functioning alcoholic and never misses a day of work because of it. He is our main provider and always has been, but in the past, he has used that to his advantage by threatening us if we ever called the police. 

I do love him. and I care for him and I want him to apologize and sincerely mean it. I am just not sure how to address this or have a conversation with him about the way his abuse has made me feel. Our family has never had this conversation. It's as if we always ignore the fact that he would become a monster at night and terrorize our home. Many nights that felt like a complete nightmare due to his actions. I don't know how to approach the situation or if speaking to him about this and expecting an apology is unrealistic.",domesticviolence
Cannot Afford a divorce,,domesticviolence
How ABA conditioned me to be abused and raped- TW for rape," I was born in 1995 to a very young married couple. My infancy was good; I was held a lot by my parents and my mom stayed home all day with me. Both of my parents have said I was a very happy and giggly baby and a joy to be around. This was all going to change, however.

When I was a year old, we got evicted from our apartment and moved in with my grandparents. My parents’ marriage crumbled and my dad had to move out. He looked at me sleeping in my crib that day, knowing he had to leave, expecting to never see me again. Through my childhood I was told my dad didn’t want to raise me anymore and it was also implied to be due to me being diagnosed with Autism.

I was diagnosed with Autism and put through ABA inspired therapies in order to function as normally as possible. My grandmother especially pushed me to make eye contact and let people hug me, no matter how I felt. I couldn’t appear to be a rude child to anyone she knew, so I let people do it. 

When I was in after school daycare, I was told by the workers that I had to share my toys with other children. It went as far as the workers allowing other children to take stuff from me/not punishing them if they did.

By the time I got to my teen years, my grandmother was still washing me in the bath when I stayed over. I had been pushing her to let me bathe on my own since I hit puberty but she refused to allow it. She thought that due to my Autism, I was incapable of bathing. She used the same rationale to justify dressing me and helping me into bathing suits long after I was capable.

I got involved with two internet predators, both of whom consumed my life. Both of them would require me to keep in constant contact, preventing me from developing a social life. 

I dated a man whose mother was especially abusive towards me. She would yell at me, threaten me, and treat me like a small child. Her son rarely ever defended me against her and often said I deserved it.

My next partner was no better. We were long distance and he was sexually aggressive very early on, demanding that I send him sexual pictures. This eventually became videos, which had to happen weekly minimum. He used sex as a punishment for any and all infractions. If I said the wrong thing, took too long coming home, or didn’t tell him about a purchase I made, he would punish me by forcing me to get naked over Skype. I would be forced to finger myself or do whatever he told. I had to inflict pain on myself for his own pleasure.

I visited him last year and his attitude towards me changed. A couple days into the visit, he got angry with me for fidgeting too much in my sleep. He spent the morning yelling at me and then apologized. He took me out for coffee to try to “repair our bond”

A few days later, I went to bed at around 2 in the morning. He was still awake so he continued to watch TV for another few minutes. He eventually came to bed and started touching me while I was trying to sleep. He felt me up under my clothes and tried to have sex with me, despite me trying to sleep. I asked him to please stop and told him I wanted to sleep. He said no and continued to touch me, also starting to remove my clothes. I started to cry and pleaded with him to stop. He got angry with me and told me to go into the bathroom. I got up and sat on the floor in his bathroom for probably 20 minutes until he grabbed me and pushed me to his bed.

Once he got me to the bed, he said he was going to give me something to cry about. He pushed me down and pulled my bottoms off. He forced himself inside me and thrusted as hard as he could. I asked him to please stop but he continued even harder. He continued for around 15 to 20 minutes as I cried, frozen. He suddenly stopped and apologized. I stayed unable to move until I coaxed myself into pulling my pants up. He said he would never do it again and I just lay there, still frozen. I did not sleep well that night.

On another occasion, we got into an argument. After yelling at me and telling me I was nothing but an arrogant brat, he placed his hands on my neck. He pressed down and choked me for a minute. Not long enough for me to lose consciousness, but long enough to let me know who was in charge. I knew then he could kill me if he wanted to.

I am pleased to say I am doing better now. My rapist and I have split up and I am now with a lovely man. He knows about all of my trauma and never uses it against me. Now, when I cry, instead of being told I’m stupid or spoiled, I get cuddles and love. My boyfriend allows and encourages me to go for walks, to have friends, etc. He’s been there through the hard times and the easy times. I am slowly learning to trust him and feel loved.",domesticviolence
Should I stay or go?,"I am F20 and live with my two parents who are highly emotionally manipulative and toxic to each other. I'm in a situation where from the time I was born up until I was around 16, my dad was heavily physically abusive to me, my mom, and my little brother. When I say that, I mean fits that lasted upwards of three to six hours where he would throw all of us against walls, grab our jaws so hard that it hurt to eat for several days, pull our hair, throw us on the floor and kick us, tackle us to the floor, jump on top of us and scream and spit in our face, and at times, beat our bodies with his fists. I was constantly hiding bruises at school, I remember at least one occasion where my mom hid her black eye with sunglasses from the repairman fixing our sink, and oftentimes I the abuse was so heavy I thought my dad might not realize his own strength and would accidentally kill me. I lived in constant terror.

As you can imagine, I was heavily traumatized as a kid. To make matters worse, my parents also raised me in an extremely strict religious cult, and because of the rules (particularly regarding clothing &amp; appearance), I was heavily mocked, bullied, and rejected at school and nearly every other social situation I have ever been in. When I was 12, my parents pulled me out of school because I was cutting myself (I didn't do this for attention; I did it on my thighs, which were covered at all times even in the summer due to the dress code rules, but my mom walked in on me changing), and they thought the bullying was the cause of it. Basically, they homeschooled me, except they both worked full time, so I was pretty much left alone in the house, and nearly the only social situation interaction I got until I began college was when I went to the cult church, where most of the people were mean and bullied me.

During my childhood years, my mom took 24 hours a semester and rushed to get 8 yrs of school done in 3.5 yrs, along with several certifications. What I watched her go through was brutal and intense; I watched her have so many meltdowns getting through all that school while raising my brother and I, but she was scared it might get to a point that she would have to flee for our lives, and she was terrified she wouldn't be able to support us. She went from having a few hours at a community college from years ago to being a highly educated professional and working as a controller, and making a decent amount more financially than my dad does. When that happened, she stood up to him and stopped the hours long fits and physical abuse.

Basically, I'm in a situation where the physical abuse and emotional manipulation, the years of isolation, and the bullying have created a cocktail where I'm struggling to be mentally stable, though I've mostly dealt with this by being a perfectionist. I was not educated well during the years I was isolated, however, I was already so far ahead because my parents had high standards and began teaching my brother and I upper level math in elementary, so I was able to get into community college early and didn't struggle with math until I hit pre-cal. I was always made to read a lot, too, so I tended to excel in the non-math courses. As a youth, to cope with my pain, I embraced the fantasy of being perfect, and I ended up doing things like getting up at 4 AM to work out amd teaching myself to speak a second language fluently. However, I struggle with bulimia, it's better now, but it was horrible for years, I have really bad OCD and compulsions, and while I got on Lexapro for the first time in February and it's absolutely changed my life, all the flashbacks and things I'm dealing with still make it really hard to cope.

Anyway, my parents are better now that my dad doesn't physically abuse me, but my parents are still heavily emotionally manipulative and it takes a toll on me. Tonight, they yelled at me for something I never said for five hours; I'm not exaggerating. I begged them that I just wanted to go; I'm always respectful to them. They literally ran around the room, threw things like a chair and a dip machine, my mom threw two iron weights against the floor so hard they broke, they screamed at the top of their lungs, and all of the emotional manipulation and twisted logic was just a lot. Now that I'm on anxiety meds and my boyfriend has come into my life and has actually pointed out bow twisted their logic is and validated my feelings/assured me that their insults to me are unfounded, I cope better, but it still hurts, and tonight left me so exhausted and drained. I cried to the point I was dehydrated. 

But, my problem is, back to my perfectionism, I set my sights on medical school a few years ago because I thought it would give me self worth, but I've actually come to love medicine. I'm going to be a senior after I finish my summer classes, I've gotten through most of the more difficult classes and have a high GPA, and with all the research I've done on GPA, the MCAT, ECs, etc., I genuinely believe I'll be able to get in. My parents are very financially generous, and they're paying for everything, including my education (even though I try to offer to pay for things, they won't let me). My mom is extremely controlling; she called my boss a month after I was fired for something minor where a lot of other employees agreed the boss had it out for me, but it was whatever, and chewed the boss out. That humiliated me. The idea of a parent calling their nearly 21 year old child's boss a month after that child was let go is so inappropriate and embarrassing, but both parents believe that's their right as parents because they pay the bills. My mom found out I lost my virginity last year, and she is mad I haven't apologized to her for that. I lied and said I only had sex with my boyfriend one time and am not sexually active, but she treats my boyfriend like trash now and hates him even though he's an amazing guy, and she loved him before she knew that. She was extremely angry when she found out I was in his bedroom this weekend, even though it was daytime and his parents were right outside in the living room. She questions me on everything, her control exhausts me. I spend several hours a day doing chores, I'm highly responsible, don't drink, smoke, use drugs, etc., am very respectful and don't back talk, but she will not stop seeing me as a child.

So, I have one year left until I'm done with my bachelor's. I'm scared my GPA might drop if I have to work full time while I'm taking classes like O-Chem 2, and I also need to study for the MCAT. The fact that they're paying for everything, and I don't have to pay my own way makes it easier to shadow, research, etc. I'm already on the home stretch, and I know that if by some chance I didn't get into medical school, I'd be stuck with a biology degree I can't do a lot with, and I'd have to give up my dream. I don't know what to do. It sounds silly that I legitimately fear they might beat me again some day. I keep my phone with me, so I can call 911 if that were to happen. I hate having that kind of fear in my own house. But I'm so scared of striking out on my own and not getting in and being screwed.

What would you all do in this situation? Try to hold out and keep a phone close by in case anything happens? I don't think my life is in danger, but I do think I could be decently injured (I don't predict it, but it wouldn't surprise me). They put their hands on me forcefully now, especially my mom, but they don't abuse me. Are there options where I could move out and get into medical school, too? Could I take out loans? My parents have access to my bank account and would take that, my phone, and my car. I'm going to start my own bank account for my next job and hope they don't say anything, but if I were to strike out right now, I'd essentially have nothing to my name. Help...",domesticviolence
Is this what I think it is?,"Abuse basically. 

This morning I started a probably unwarranted argument about something that was getting to me. I was honest with how I felt about the situation. I talked exclusively about how I felt not how he made me felt. I feel this is an important difference.

Anyway he blew up big time and said the following things. I’m struggling to digest and this is not the first time he has said some of these things (if not some other really worse things in the past)

Please help me to process and to see a way. I’m struggling.

Short note on domestic violence,,domesticviolence
VERY LONG POST. Is this abuse?,"I've been with my man for 15 years.
Within the first few months, he had slapped me very hard a few times, the first being after I said Usher was sexy. He told me not to disrespect him like that. 
At 6 months together we moved in together, and things changed a lot. I had moved 4 hours away from my family of be with him since he moved for work. I was attending college but eventually stopped. We didn't have internet so I stayed at home pretty much all day. I would clean and do my make-up and wait for him to be home. 
When he was home, he would basically ignore me, or insist that I perform oral sex on him, which I didn't mind, but if I said I didn't want to, he would berate me, sometimes hurt me, definitely forced it a bunch of times. 
I will say that I have a kink which is being forced, but a lot of the time, I wasn't into it and asked him to stop. He didn't. And if I cried he enjoyed it even more.
If he was annoyed by my fighting sometimes he would stop and throw me to the floor, calling me useless. (This has never stopped btw, 15 years in and he still does it). 
One night he came home from being at a bar with his sister (I was 18 and couldn't go). He was in a bad mood, I could tell. I tried to be nice but because he was so drunk, he wanted to have sex. He was having... difficulties...and said it was because I was overweight. I told him he could hurt me, (I'm a masochist and he's a sadist) and that helped, but he took it too far. He raped me and beat me for 4 hours. I know because I kept focusing on the digital clock on the bedside table. Bright red numbers counting the minutes of my terror.
A month after that I left, but 4 months of being with a worse guy and basically being homeless, I begged him to come save me. He showed up, got me off the drugs I was addicted to, and held me through my withdrawals. I suffered a miscarriage also, I didn't even know I was pregnant. He was so caring and sweet, and had done a lot of maturing while we were broken up.
We get an apartment together and it's like a fairytale. We don't fight, don't argue, we were madly in love again. We lived there for a year and it was great. Then he lost his career, we moved to a different apartment, and he started drinking heavily. We had a friend living with us and he drank with him all day and night..I'm talking they finished off entire handles each, and he started being controlling again. I had to keep the house clean and cook every meal for him and our roommate. He would punch my leg and keep digging his thumb into the bruise if I didn't do what I was supposed to do. He hated when I hung out with friends, and constantly accused me of cheating. At the time, Myspace was still a thing and he had numerous girls on there who he would go spend time with...I have since found out he was cheating.
After I finally kicked out roommate out for bringing over people who would steal from us, he sobered up and his behavior stopped being so bad. He would romance me and things got better. 
We got another place since we were kicked out of that place (long story) and though he was still very controlling thing calmed down again. 
Now I want to say that I love this man with everything I have. He doesn't react with rage, he doesn't beat me into a corner, he doesn't do what I consider to be abuse. Not since that first year together. But, in the 15 years we've been together, he goes through stages of being aggressive towards me. He insults me, forces sex or sexual acts, and then it stops. For months at a time sometimes. It's gotten to the point where I don't know how to feel normal. It's almost like I want him to be like that because it feels like our normal...? Does that make sense?? Not to mention that it has severely affected my sexual pleasure, I can't seem to enjoy myself if he isn't being aggressive or at least demeaning me in some way. It's something he's always done, and I don't know how to ""get off"" without it.
Flash forward to 2011, we moved again, again away from my family and friends, and again I try to go to school, and he gets a good job. But as before, I stop going to school and stay home all day. I clean, I cook, etc. We would rarely go out to town or anything, we were always home. He started to be a little more aggressive more often. Randomly. I didn't know what would set it off. One time I had a black eye, a very mild one, but it was there. He took me out to eat and go shopping, after making me do my makeup so it wasn't visible. While out he asked me how it felt to know people had no idea that he hurt me like that since we look so happy. I didn't know what to say but he put my hand on his crotch and he was as hard as a rock. 
Later he held me down and forced himself on me while slapping me harder than before on the same side where the bruise was. 
We lived out there for almost 10 years. This behavior became more frequent and more intense. My entire life became centered around him and what he liked or didn't like. My appearance, my housekeeping, everything. But again it wasn't like what I believed abuse to be. I've seen in movies or heard about it from people and it just seemed more dramatic and violent than what he would do. What he did was always cool and calm, he did it with such ease and confidence, I kept telling myself it was a game, he did it to turn himself on, because he's a sadist. We played around with bondage, role played, all the normal BDSM stuff so I just thought it was part of it. 
He'd do it for a while, constantly, then as before, he would just stop. And again I felt myself needing it. I'd need him to hit me, or be mean to me. I found myself feeling anxious or uneasy if he wasn't being dominant and mean. So I would ask. And if I brought up that I felt he went too far and said maybe this was abuse and not good, he would laugh and say I asked for it....which I did. 
So it was something I wanted...
Here I am, almost 16 years together with him and now it's scary. Again his drinking got bad and he has been doing it more. But it's different now. Now I tell him I don't want it. I cry. I fight. I break down and he just keeps doing it. He says he doesn't care that I don't want it. I tell him I'm afraid of him and he smiles and says good. He'll get drunk and throw me to the ground if I say something he considered too sassy or bitchy. He doesn't always hit me, but he holds me down and says awful things to me. He makes me cry. He reminds me I have nowhere to go. That if I leave I would just go running back to him because I can't do anything right, (I have some issues so he's not wrong) and that no other man would ever be able to deal with my baggage and no one would want an overweight woman in her 30s. The sad thing is he's right. He uses me past against me when he wants to make me cry. 
And every time he does this he gets hard. He can't help but touch himself as he's either hurting me or demeaning me and insulting me. He loves doing it. 
I love him. I know I do because we've been through so much and we really are like best friends. We understand each other so well, we have been so close since the day we met. And I have my own problems. I take responsibility for him getting a taste for hurting me, because I was curious about BDSM and that stuff when we were first dating, but I never imagined he was actually abusive. Or is this abuse? I don't have bruises all over my body, I don't cower in a corner, although I have before, he doesn't beat me senseless... it just doesn't feel like the abuse we all know about from ads and movies, etc. 
I don't fear for my life because he doesn't lash out like that, he hasn't escalated like I assume he should have by now,... IDK what to call this. 


Honestly I'm not sure why I'm sharing this because I have no intention of leaving him, he's my world. I am happy with him. My day to day life is good, we laugh all the time. If you saw us together you'd never know that sometimes he gets rough with me or says mean things. He is normal 80% of the time. 

Idk. Is this abuse?",domesticviolence
It's my fault I poked the bear,"My bf and I just moved into a 1 bedroom together 
We use to live with friends in a house then spent time at his moms. My bf and I have been together for 2 years. He has gotten physically violent by moving me or shoving me out of the way before we were in the one bedroom but never anything that crazy ridiculous. I take his stuff like his mouse or his charger and hide it when he would ignore me or stonewall me after a fight. He says I took him for granted so that's why he had to get away from me or zone out. We got a one bedroom so he could have his own space because he doesnt trust me to respect his space. It's TRUE I guess. When I wanna talk with him or discuss a fight, he just stonewalls for like a day or a week or a month. It's gotten better now he just disappears to his moms for a whole 24 hours... at one point he took my phone during a fight so I took his stuff and told him give it back or I'm gonna throw it and I did and I felt awful I havent hurt any of his thing since because I really never wanted to hurt anything of his but he had pushed me around and shoved me to the ground and said horrible things to me then took my phone and it was bad. About a 2 month ago hes got into it with his brother and his brothers friend at a a party at his moms and after he pinned his brother to the wall his brother followed him and they went back to our place so his sister gave me a ride. He texted me sorry. During the fight he got mean towards me because I was telling him to calm down. All he did was text me sorry. And when I got back the next evening I tried to talk about it with him and he was like ""why do I owe you anything"" and we got into a fight and again I wouldnt give him his space and I poked the bear as I always do and he throw me down and he covered my mouth and my nose so I couldnt breath... he also laid down on my head so my head was stuck between him and the floor btw my bf is a big guy like 250lb 6 feet tall huge linebacker. I am 5 feet tall 124lb Now here i am a few months later. I hid his keys so he couldn't leave I followed him every time he did try to leave and after all that when I wouldn't give him space in his room he shoved me he held me down hes hit me ""not that hard"" he said. Hes dragged me around by my hair or my feet he held me down and grabbed my breasts just to be disrespectful and he broke all of my art on my walls because I moved stuff around in his room to get his attention. Hes pressed my head into the ground and called me awful names and held my jaw closed so I couldnt scream. Covered my face multiple times. He kept hold me down and I always struggled and it hurt my arm and my back he stretched my leg and covered my mouth so I could cry while he pushed it upwards he grabbed me by my neck and pinned in weird backwards position .My shoulders hurt my body hurts my face hurts, not bad but it hurts. Hes left barely any Mark's but there are Mark's on my face and my neck. He kept hurting my eye while trying to cover my mouth. I called the police they showed I covered for him because none of this wouldve happened if I didnt poke the bear. I pushed his button I did whatever I knew I could to push his buttons. Idk why...idk why I do these things to trigger him I just want his attention I want him to care...idk oh I gave him his keys he left but all his stuff is here.",domesticviolence
Questions about my neighbour - can people change?,"\[Ontario, Canada\]  


I've posted before about my next door neighbour's abuse of his wife. Last fall the police finally arrested him and took him away. He was gone for a few months and now he's back.   


What is the likelihood in Ontario that he went through a batterer intervention program of some kind? Is it possible that he has changed? I know that without such a program the chances that someone changes are near zero but I don't know what happens with the programs.   


My place faces out the back of the house so I don't see the comings and goings from their house unless I'm outside anyway. I haven't seen his wife in months but I also haven't heard any raised voices or anything coming from their place since he has been back. I'm quite sure she's still living there though.",domesticviolence
I Need Help Staying Away,"I am so lucky.  I left today before anything got too physical.  He put out a lit cigarette on me about a year ago and has shaken me by the shoulders, but nothing more than that.  I can see now, though, how thoroughly he manipulates and emotionally abuses me.

I cheated early in our relationship, but have been faithful for five years.  Still, every issue we have is ""my fault"" because I destroyed him with this.

He has called me names, said really terrible things about me, and isolated me as thoroughly as he could.  He tells me that when I talk to other people about the things he says and does that I am being ""emotionally abusive"" and manipulative, because I want everyone on my side.  He says he's in charge of our marriage.  When he gets angry, it's always ""my fault"" for ""provoking"" him because ""I love drama"".  When I go away, usually for a day, ""we can't work things out if I'm ignoring him"".  He loves me so much.  He's so sorry.  He's in a really dark place.  He's just off drugs.  ""I don't love him"".  ""There's another man in my life"".  ""I am giving up"".  ""I don't really want this to work"".  

It usually works really well for him.  I'm usually back within a day or two.  The cycle starts over.  Promises made, honeymoon phase, promises broken, argument, feeling guilty, realizing it's not all my fault, leaving, feeling more guilty, and repeat.  

Please help me stay strong.  I can't do it alone.  I know we're all strangers, but I'm so scared I'll go back.  I love him so much.",domesticviolence
Everything feels impossible.,"He was always emotionally and verbally abusive. Lots of guilt and shame. Name-calling, blame, threatening, raking out all insecurities and possible triggers. 

And I still married him. Because I loved him. And because he was moving with the military to Europe. And because all attempts at leaving before were unsuccessful. 

So I moved with him. And all my hurt would come out in waves when I couldn't hold it in anymore. That's when he first hurt me by grabbing my arm, holding a hand over my face so I couldn't yell, leaving bruises in innocuous places. Flicking my nose.

""I'm so sorry. I love you so much. You just need to deal with your issues. I wouldn't have done it if you hadn't been freaking out.""

Then he took the first step to hurting me intentionally. He slapped my arm while we were cooking.

""Well you wouldn't shut up.""

Then the escalation. Putting my face between his arm and his hand because I was ""raising my voice."" Fighting him off led to me sitting on the floor where he knelt down, placed a hand around my throat and pushed. And then mocked me when I fought to get my breath back. 

""I love you. Don't leave. We can work through this. You want to stay married right? You promise?""

How could I say no. I was alone, in a foreign country, no family, no real connections yet. We hadn't even been married a year. 

""I'm tired of this petty bullshit. You stupid bitch. Fucking idiot. You're psychotic.""

He loved the mental health angle. He loved using specific words to incite my past struggles. Throwing my fight with self-harm in my face. Never praising that I had come so far and gotten so much better.

Then he finally hit me. And when I wouldn't stop bleeding, that's when he wanted to sit and talk. That's when I needed to calm down.

And I feel guilty. About *everything*. 

I called for help. Got taken away. Taken to the ER. Mandated into unrestricted reporting. Set up with interviews and Victims Advocates. Pictures were taken of my body, my face. Black eye, scratches, bruises. 

And I feel like it's not a big deal. I should just go home and apologize. I'm still in a foreign country. I have no family. I have one person willing to take me in temporarily. 

I have a job I love. I have a dog I adore. 

And I still feel guilty. I feel ashamed. I want to call him. Apologize. Over and over. Just go back. Let things blow over, move on. The world is already a dumpster fire, why should I make it harder on us. Why should I put his career and reputation in jeopardy.

He drank every night. And I just did it too. Seemed easier. It led to worse fights. But sometimes it just led to peaceful passing out. 

He is broken. Hurting. Full of pain, anger, and anguish. He has trauma he's never dealt with. I wanted to comfort him. I want to comfort him. 

I miss him. It's only been two days. Everything feels awful. Everything feels impossible.",domesticviolence
Tried to find shelter and was told they couldn’t help,"I’ve been in a long term relationship for seven years. We were supposed to get married a few months ago, but things didn’t pan out due to everything shutting down. Like many long term relationships we have had our ups and downs. The downs were typically arguments and discussions about boundaries. I’ve worked on not sharing so much of my anxieties and they never really thought they had a problem. 

Recently they have become violent. They threw a bookshelf, some remotes and after that a wooden box down the stairs that they claimed wouldn’t had hit me. I feel overwhelmed and unsafe. 

For over two months I have tried looking for apartments with no luck in my pay bracket (everywhere I go says I don’t make enough, but I don’t qualify for assistance). Insult to injury, I was told after multiple phone calls looking for shelter that I wasn’t poor enough to get help.  I was told after being honest about the $150 I had in my bank to get a hotel. “We can’t help you till you have used all resources.” I don’t know what I am supposed to do.

I feel suicidal, and all anyone can say is, “what did you do for yourself today?” I’ve tried to get help and it’s not working.",domesticviolence
Is violence irreversible? Was her violence provoked by me?,"Is violence irreversible after it has started? Like, if it's a box that has been opened, it generally becomes worse over time?

I always had a hard time hiding my temper when I felt like my ex was stupid when I helped her with her studies. She hated herself during such times, and hated me for making her hate herself. Bad feelings became verbal arguments, and then escalated to her hitting me to let the anger out.

When I initiated the breakup, her very rare violent behaviors soon escalated into full blow. She slapped, bit, threw things at me, pushed me up against the wall, threatened to harm me and my family, and once pointed a knife at me.

I know that she probably has deep-seated problems, but I feel guilty because I feel like my constant put-downs and dissatisfactions in her and in the relationship somehow contributed to her bad mental state and behavior, or at least that's what she told me. She was very sweet and gentle in the beginning, but somehow it turned into this.

So I guess what I wanted to ask was, is the relationship irreversible and can only get worse if somehow we maintain our connection? And am I right in feeling guilty in this, or is her problem only something bigger and I had a very small part to play?

Thank you for your insights.",domesticviolence

I told him i was pregnant. He came to the appointment and had two shots of whiskey after. Handled it well at first. Second Prenatal appointment was awkward, refused prenatal vitamins, no smiles from either of us. He always wrestled me roughly because i was getting rid of it anyway it didnt matter. Asked me why i watched what i ate because it didnt matter. Yelled at me in the regular, avoided me.


I tried to eat a lot of parsley. It didnt work. Aspirin, didnt work. ""You cant clean a house, we arent ready for a baby what would it eat, fucking roaches?"" I cleaned the house hoping maybe i would be ready. Still, no. ""We dont have enough furniture. We need our own place, you're bad at cleaning, we need more time together alone, we need to travel""

Two years later i am still with him and we have bought a house, have furniture, I have a career, we have a car, i clean more now. Seeing a roach gives me that same flashback about why i wasn't good enough to keep my baby.

October 2018 
 i had a surgical abortion at 13 weeks, we had to drive 4 hours and stay over night to make the appointment. I was terrified as i had just gotten my car back after a car accident. I begged him that maybe we could make things work- he said they wouldn't. I covered all the mirrors in the house because i couldn't stand to look at myself, started drinking, defeated alcoholism later on and he hasnt changed a bit.

February 2019 My second abortion at 6 weeks was at home with pills by his coaxing. Nothing had changed.  I told him never again.",domesticviolence
Ex Keeps Coming Into Work,"My ex mistakenly came into my workplace again he immediately left so I feel its an appropriate response. The last time he came in the store they were supposed to send a warrany for his arrest. Well, now I just want to quit the job especially when my boss was cussing at me over a flat tire. I have 2 jobs right now I could find a second job maybe elsewhere. Why put up with all the negativity when my boss disrespects me anyway- except I really do need the job. 

Area small I didn't want to work at that location but that's the only store that would hire me. I tried applying to a different store no luck.

Kinda lost any thoughts and such much appreciated.",domesticviolence
Secondary fallout,No one really talks about the damage it does to familial relationships to be abused. My mother tends to either forget or purposefully forgets that I was abused and I’m vulnerable because of it. My brother too walked out of my life and then when my abusive relationship ended he thought that everything would go back to normal. I got used to not needing him in my life. He wants me to put more effort to make our relationship better. He tells me I pushed him out but he walked out. I just feel like a victim of my families absent- mindedness. I don’t know if it’s secondary fallout or really just a prime example of how fast people think you need to “get over it”,domesticviolence
Mental Abuse - I Need Help,"Hi there everybody,

This post isn't about me; its about my sister. 

About a year ago, my eighteen year old sister brought a guy back to my house (my moms...but still, I live here) and he was alright at first. For the first month or so, he was actually a decent person. However, after that first month, everything flipped upside down. The verbal abuse began little by little. Not knowing the true scope of this abuse - I felt bad for him. He talked about how bad of a life he had, and that he suffers from mental illness. As time went on, he would blame everything on mental illness. We found out my sister was pregnant, and it only made everything so much worse. I decided to hire him at a store I was managing, just for him to mix alcohol and Xanax while on the job, causing him to black out and literally destroy my car while running around almost naked.

I am absolutely terrified that he will put his hands on my sister already. Every night, I hear her screaming and crying, while he is yelling at her while making violent threats towards my family. When we defend my sister, she denies that anything is wrong, while he continues to threaten us in a house that he lives in for free. She refuses to let us kick him out, because that's the father of her child and he apparently took her virginity, she ""loves"" him. I dont want to repeat anything that has been said because it is very triggering. My parents have no idea what is truly going on because they're deaf and can't hear the entiee context of the arguments/abuse. I absolutely cannot handle this anymore. He is SO disrespectful towards my mom - he has even said that he cheated on her because she was signing and driving at the same time?? (She was asking directions so he could sell percocets...) We have screenshots of him threatening us. Now that the baby has been born and hes a few months old, the mental abuse continues. He threatens to take the baby across the country to his family's house on a daily basis, yet leaves my mom, the same person he talks trash about every single day, to take care of the baby while my sister suffers from post partum depression. If he ever leaves, we want to move into a place that he will never find.

What do i do? How do I get him out of the house? We are all terrified of him. 

There is so much more to the story, but I cannot think straight right now. I havent gotten more than two hours of sleep a day for weeks because of this going on.",domesticviolence
My husband keeps hitting me- I don't know what to do,"Hello, I have been in a relationship for 3 years and married for almost a year to a man. Our relationship is ugly. About a few months into dating, he hit me for the first time. I don't remember the reason why he hit me, as most of the time it is over the smallest of arguments, but it happened. I have a background of child abuse and child sexual abuse and so when he was sincerely apologetic, I forgave him. We have really beautiful highs and terrible lows. There has been countless times where he has forced me to pleasure him, and he has been too rough and would hit me really hard, and wouldn't stop when I wanted him to. He has hit me many times during arguments, and has left me bruised on countless occassions. I've been choked many times, and once he did it while we were in public and going for a walk. We were arguing over something and he started choking me so hard that i started blacking out. It was dark and there was nobody around except for people in the distance who walked past us and I pretended like nothing was happening. 

I am not a perfect person. Most of the time, I feel like I deserve it. I have a horrible tendancy to keep talking and I think out of frustration, he hits me to get his message across. I speak over him, we call each other all sorts of names, he says I disrespect him and so he hits me out of frustration. I don't know what to do. I love him. I can't see myself out of this. I come from a Muslim family and his family is Muslim too. I can't imagine going back to my parents as I am scared about what he might do. We have just had another fight where he got a knife and threatened to kill me and then kill himself. Then he grabbed his stuff and left. He took our house keys with him so I know he will be back. I have no place to go. I have a good job but he has access to all of my finances and puts my money into his own savings account so I currently have no money to move out. I want to dissappear completely. But I'm torn. I love him. I don't know what to do.",domesticviolence
"My ex beat me up, so I wrote a song and produced a music video about it","Hi all! 
So I’ve recently released my first music video, called ‘Use me’. It deals with bulimia, my abusive relationship, struggling to conform to the increasing pressures of society, drugs, mental health and fun things like that.
I was formerly a high fashion model, which massively fucked me up, and I suffered with anorexia and then bulimia. I later bought my way out of my contract as I recognised I was no longer willing to, quite literally, change myself for other people.
At the same time, I was in an incredibly toxic relationship which also completely fucked me up. I kept trying to leave. I tried and I tried and I tried. And then one day I was sick and tired of being sick and tired and I upped and left.
In this video, I am portrayed as all the people that the modelling industry / my ex wanted me to be.

I’m so sick of reliving it constantly in my head even though it’s long over.,"I’ve been no contact with my abusive ex for nearly a year, with a protective order in place. I’m safe. But some days I just sit here ruminating and reliving everything that happened and I just want it be out of my head.

I wish I could get my memory erased. I’m sick of thinking about him pinning my down, kicking me, telling me how disgusting and ugly I was. Telling me no one would ever put up with me. That I’m a psychopath and I’m lucky that he loved me. Threatening suicide every time I left. Crying in front of police officers. Leaving my work and seeing his car sitting there waiting for me. Just KNOWING there a verbal and physical assault waiting for me. Seeing him walking into the bar I was at and getting embarrassed in front of everyone. I was told everyday that I was fat, stupid, unlovable, white trash, unintelligent and there was always someone better than me, someone who he could “get with.” I spent so many nights laying awake wondering if I’d see the sunrise. I’d try to just sleep and he’d rip off the blankets and kick me onto the floor.

I didn’t fucking deserve any of it. I’ve tried to work through everything in therapy. But day after day I find myself reliving the trauma, and feeling seething anger and a desire for some sort of penance or revenge. Every silver Aveo I see, I tense up, worried it’s him. I just want to forget. I don’t want to live the rest of my life hating someone and having them take up so much space in my brain. I want every thought to just go away.",domesticviolence
"Lived through 7+ years of domestic abuse from a family member, need a way out...","Been resisting the urge to post, trying to keep this as vague as possible as to lessen the chances of the bastard in question finding this, as unlikely as it is due to them not using reddit and being somewhat tech illiterate... rather not have him finding out, though i don't fear for my life and i doubt he could do anything serious besides power grabbing moves, it's been mostly verbal abuse with little physical abuse but i can't rest properly until he's gone, i need a way out of this with how often he explodes into verbal abuse...

&amp;#x200B;

I'm an adult, age 19+ with no idea how to get out of this mess, i don't fear him as much as i hate him, but i can't seem to get an opportunity to get evidence against him, and if law enforcement is around, he plays calm until out of the area if he was in an episode... any attempt to get evidence has usually passed before i can do anything, rest of the family doesn't seem to want to/have the ability to do anything about it, so it seems like it's on me to do something instead... any suggestions would be much appreciated... i feel like the opportunity has passed to get him enough to keep him away, but i guess that's why i'm here, i hope the first part doesn't take away from the seriousness of the situation... money isn't exactly easy to come by and being in a situation where you're cooped up inside your home isn't helping... and unfortunately for me and the family i care about, mother and siblings, he's smart enough not to do it if there's a camera within line of sight to him...",domesticviolence
Anyone have an abuser say it was self defense?,"Hey. New here.
Has anyone had a partner that slapped and or hit them and then said it was ok because it was self defense? It clearly wasn't and I think she is just telling herself whatever story she needs to feel ok with giving me a black eye etc.
My ex would binge drink about every other month, sometimes less, and verbally abuse me and or hit me.
Yes, I yelled and yeah, I broke my own things. Example: my little acoustic guitar.
Anyway, just here for support and to somehow come to terms why I allowed this person to abuse me for 5 years.

I'm at a loss of what to do with my life,"24f

Without going into too much detail I'm a citizen of a country that opresses women and living in a country that opresses women. My father makes being a woman even harder with his strict religious rules and beliefs. I have been raised to be submissive while my whole being shouts for me to escape but I don't see how.

If i ever said where i lived no one would touch me with a 10 foot pole because there is nothing that can be done that will make my situation better in this country. Only a miracle would change my situation.

There is no support for abused or opressed woman in this country

I don't know how to escape or where to escape.

While I have no physical marks or bruises my inside is filled with the scars of emotional and physiological abuse. I need help but no where to turn to, no one to go to, no one to support me, no one who would listen.

Will I stay opressed my whole life? What's the point of living a life like that? I don't see any light at the end of the tunnel. It's dark all around",domesticviolence
Finally seeing the abuse as they really were.,"I have been out of the relationship for one whole month. Well, we are still texting a few times daily, so I am not technically out of the relationship yet, and perhaps won't for some time. However I am gradually starting to see the abusive patterns in our relationship, and view things as they really were.

I wasn't really wrong when I felt frustrated she couldn't understand it when I explained programming concepts to help her study. I always tried my best to constrain the frustration when teaching her, but she would always pick it out and lash out at me in return. I realize that I wasn't wrong when I repeatedly told her I was having doubts about the relationship, it was an attempt of open communication and it wasn't a sin, or that I was putting her down and deliberately making her feel inadequate. I wasn't really wrong when I wanted out, despite the fact that she followed me to a new country when I gave her a sort of ultimatum (""If you don't come to Canada, we'll have to break up."").

She is trying to layer all these guilt upon me, and even now, I still feel guilty and responsible for the above things I did.

I went back to the island one week ago, because I missed her like hell. I missed her so much that my heart felt weak and my hands trembled. It is funny, how I had been pondering breakup for the majority of the day, but ever since I really went out, I could miss her so much. My emotional dependence on her was undeniable. Every day she waited for me in front of the fireplace. She used to be so happy when I returned, and she would care about my life and health, cook for me, and listen to all the silly and the most out-of-the-world things I had to say. I missed having someone always there for me.

But the bad times, oh they were so bad. Her opinion of me shifts drastically during those episodes where she felt she wasn't ""understood."" She gaslights me (""No I haven't said that"", ""no I didn't do it"", blatantly tells me that my feelings are unimportant to her, tells me I am too needy, that all my future partners will cheat on me because of that, says that me and all my family are psychopaths, and that I won't have any achievements in life, that my pouring out my heart to her made her feel speechless, etc. That I am selfish, fake and have a weak soul.

The days pending the breakup which I initiated were the worst. She blamed me for all her problems, and accused me of not caring about her at all. She slapped, choked, kicked, bit, threw things at me, pushed me up against walls, and once pointed a knife at me. She would stand in front of my room at night with ""that look,"" refused to let me sleep and gave me verbal threats for half an hour, sitting at my bed and staring at the wall. In the daytime she kept talking to herself. I was so scared.

She is normal at most times and in front of others, especially now which is weeks after I left. I know she misses me as well, but not to such an extent as I missed her. She easily closes off her emotions, as she herself said, and according to articles of personality disorders. She would think of me randomly during the day, but I guess that's basically it.

I realize that it's going to be an uphill battle, perhaps filled with loneliness, but also filled with freedom. I know that going back to the island where I used to, and somewhat still, feel like it's a home, isn't the answer to all this. Last time I went, I relived the sweetest times, but then triggered one of her episodes and got slapped, blamed and threatened in return. I won't contemplate going back to her again. She is not likely to change in the following months and even years to come.

This is what I have been thinking about today, and I am posting this out to share with you all.",domesticviolence
It never ends,"Feeling pretty low, thought I'd post.

My wife was on the downhill of an abusive marriage when we met.  Initially we were just friends, but I made her feel better, so she could take more of his abuse but also stand up for herself more.  He had stopped being physically violent by that point, he's 6'3 265+, so for him it was more verbal and punching walls or threats since he had established he could best her up anytime he just had to remind her.

She hid most of it, but I became a huge issue for them and I got used to him calling to threaten me ect once she grew numb.

Fast forward a few years, she left, eventually we got married, good times.  But they had joint custody and he started back up, screaming at her (after convincing  her she couldn't record), threatening and intimidating ect.  It escalated into stalking while I was deployed and that's when she finally told me the whole history and it clicked just how violent he could get.  Cops wouldn't take it seriously (NC isn't too progressive), and I started learning how little the system knows about its own laws.  I got smarter, but it takes FOREVER to build a case on someone who now knows they are being watched, dozens of reports, cops know him it's just waiting for a big blowup now.  The assumption is I'm here to protect her now, problem is they also tell me how fast I'll get arrested for doing it.

Brings us to today.  We show up to drop her daughter off, in the police station parking lot like always.  Ex gets out with his mom.  Daughter walks over to grandma, they go to get in his van.  He's still standing there.  I say nothing, no eye contact, wait until my wife is in the car, and as I'm getting in he starts coming towards us.  I pull out my phone, start trying to record and he starts bowing up saying he wants to fight ect.  She's yelling how rediculous this is, tells me to just go.  His mom grabs him, we pull off.

Wife doesn't stop yelling though because......

SHE IS YELLING AT ME!!! 

Now shes mad because she thinks I instigated it.  Same guy that called to cancel her daughters counseling appointment yesterday, same guy who immediately started blowing her phone up about me today being there, like I always am, on and on.

She knows he's dangerous and violent, and uses any excuse to not let their daughter call (1 call on his time a month, maybe) but when does reality set in for her that what he's doing is controlling and he wants to isolate her, so trying to get along with him is a no win game.  He has repeatedly tried to lure her out alone for various reasons and even shown up at times when he doesn't think I'll be there.

It feels some days like I can't win.",domesticviolence
6 months later,"It has been 6 months since I left an emotional, sexual, and physically abusive relationship. I still have trouble sleeping at night after taking sleeping medications.

Cannot Afford a divorce,"Hello, I am a seventeen year old living in a house with two parents, a sister, and a dog., United States

My father has been emotionally abusing my mother for a while now, with offs and ons, but it always resorts back to him emotionally abusing my mother. I do not wish to go into much detail, but everyone in my family (mother, myself, sister) have politely told our father how he constantly emotionally abuses my mother. At this point, it is impossible to speak to him, as no matter what you will say, no matter how polite, any constructive criticism you give him will result in him blaming you for ""attacking"" him. He will constantly start screaming at my mother when she is asking questions that a normal wife would ask her husband, like ""Hey I saw you went out for a bit, where did you go?"" in the politest, kindest manner possible. No matter what she does, says, anything, he screams at her constantly.

My family is in the lower middle class. We live in an apartment that is by far the cheapest in my area, and we cannot afford to separate. My mother works tirelessly at her job throughout the day, only to have to clean the house, clean up my father's messes, deal with his emotional abuse, care for her children. There are little opportunities for different places that we can move into. My sister is in college, and it is already hard enough to pay for that, let alone move out and go through all of the costs to do that. Since school is currently online due to COVID-19, internet is a necessity and that threatens to go away based on its cost. 

My father cannot be trusted with money. As a child, I would obtain birthday and Christmas money, and I would often save it up for years at a time, just for my father to ""borrow"" hundreds of dollars and never pay it back. He is an untrustworthy, lying, quick-to-anger, self-centered, emotionally abusing man.

Another problem is our dog. We were lucky enough to make an agreement with our landlords to even have a dog in the first place, and it will be hard to find a place that will allow dogs. We would also need to be able to afford to move our stuff.  We will also be paying for my college after next year.

We do not know what to do.",domesticviolence
How to have a conversation with your abuser,"Hello, I am 21 and am thinking of how to have a conversation with my once physically and emotionally abusive father. This is not to say he still isn't abusive because he is, it just isn't nearly as often. It might be once a year or so.

He has beaten me, my mother, and my siblings. Mainly when we were younger but once we got older we would always step in to defend our mother and we would just kind of get hit because we were in the middle. My sister claims that he has denied that I ever even experienced any of his abuse. However, everything is so real and I was there and endured his abuse for my whole childhood. He also drinks a lot and got arrested for drunk driving last year. However, he is a functioning alcoholic and never misses a day of work because of it. He is our main provider and always has been, but in the past, he has used that to his advantage by threatening us if we ever called the police. 

I do love him. and I care for him and I want him to apologize and sincerely mean it. I am just not sure how to address this or have a conversation with him about the way his abuse has made me feel. Our family has never had this conversation. It's as if we always ignore the fact that he would become a monster at night and terrorize our home. Many nights that felt like a complete nightmare due to his actions. I don't know how to approach the situation or if speaking to him about this and expecting an apology is unrealistic.",domesticviolence
He won't ever be able to love me because I know what a monster he is,"I'm in chaos digesting through all the shit I've been through past years. After his insults, and abuse, physical, violence, there's a fucked up voice in my head... ""He doesn't love you."" and instead of ""So what?"" I get ""Oh, he loves her."" and I can't rationalize enough... He sucks. He won't ever love me because I knew what a monster he is right from beginning. It was first or second week we knew each other, and I told him ""You look like someone who could beat a woman one day."" 

He beat me. More frequently with each kid we got.
For what?
Not being perfect woman of his dream?
Not being a mom enough (his words)?
Not being chirly new blue eyed flirty woman he met?

I only feel shame that I wasn't determined to let him go when he beat me first time in front of our kids, but instead now when he loves other woman. For she doesn't know what a monster he is.",domesticviolence
Abusive boyfriend arrested. Feeling a lot of emotions,"I feel a mix of emotions. It's been years of torment as we lived together and he has said he couldn't afford to move out (has had issues holding down a steady job throughout the years). I've kicked him out 2x before  but he ended up coming back. He never hit me but has been verbally and emotionally abusive over the years-telling me things like 'don't get me angry or I'll blow up' over the smallest things, and calling me every name in the book. He's destroyed many of my household items or he's threatened to if I don't do something he's asked right that minute. I already have issues with anxiety and he just raises it through the roof at times. I jump at loud noises because I now equate it with him blowing up and getting ready to damage something of mine. For a while I had issues with I think it's called dissociative disorder. I would look in the mirror or look at my hands and not feel like they were mine. He's even told me I should commit suicide and told me a way to do it (I am not suicidal and would never do that).

 I finally went on a domestic abuse website for help and spent 2hrs on a chat. The person sent me resources I could look over and and they helped me devise a plan to start the motions of getting him out of my apartment. Unfortunately, not even 1/2 hr later I had to text 911 for help as he threatened me, pulled a knife from the kitchen and started stabbing the couch, and then told me to keep quiet. 

He's been arrested and held. I feel relief, sadness, shock, and guilt. He definitely has some mental issues that he refused to get help with (refused to see any doctors, wouldn't go for annual check up, wouldn't even sign up for health insurance) I'm afraid of the whole process going forward and what will come next (which is why it took me so long to call, and why his sister likely never called). I'm sad that it had to come to this and wish we could've just peacefully separated. He's said off and on throughout our relationship that he wanted to leave, and then would eventually just terrorize me.

 I feel guilt because he doesn't have the means to rent and I'm not sure where he will end up. I know this is his fault and that it's not something I should worry about, but it's something the weighs on me now.

I also feel relief because I finally told my parents what's been going on. They don't live in the area but they offered to drive up to make sure I was ok (we had plans set for mid-june and that was when I was hoping to work on his moving out process).",domesticviolence
How to calm the anger?,"Hi there. I (F32) left a 9 year long abusive relationship about 2 years ago. I have since moved on and got with an amazing man who has not even a shred of abusive tendencies in him. I love him more than I thought was possible - it's made me realise I don't think I ever loved my ex, only co-dependency feelings.   
I had not liked or really even tolerated my ex partner for a very long time, but I'd given up hope and so stayed, as we have a kid together.   
Eventually I saw behaviours in our child that I did not like (clearly mirroring his dad), and so I found the strength to get rid for good. I still have to have some contact with my ex, for obvious reasons. He has much more control over my life at this point, than I expected. I have so much regret that I even met him.  


Anyway, my issue is anger. I feel so angry with him all the time. Absolutely furious. Every day, all day, I have his voice in my head insulting me, criticising me and picking arguments. I then end up arguing back or defending myself. When I say voice I don't mean as in psychosis that I think it is real - it's just my thoughts, like day dreaming. This person has caused me so so so much damage, both emotionally and practically. I don't want him to continue causing me this much pain and anger on a daily basis, but my brain seems stuck in 4F mode.   


How on earth do I calm this anger?   
I have some grounding exercises to do, but it is often when I am doing housework or cooking, and so it's difficult to do the grounding stuff at that time. I end up in tears all the time. I have had severe depression for a very long time now, mostly due to certain things he controls in my life. I've tried to use music for distraction when I have to do these things, but it's not really doing much. I try to stay distracted at all times, as I feel I fall apart if I stop.",domesticviolence

Domestic violence by ex-roommate/best friend,"I’m feeling very alone, as most people experience this from romantic relationships. I don’t have a lot of energy to share the whole story, but the short version is that I moved out, and cut him out of my life after he hurt me (twisted my arm), threw things at me, called me misogynistic slurs, and excuses his behaviour by claiming that I “acted like a child and made him mad on purpose.”

I do have an SO, who is loving and kind. I have been with my partner for seven years.

I was close friends with this abusive person for seven years. He was not violent until we became roommates. And he wasn’t as violent as I know other abusers are. I am having weird dreams, and strong emotions about losing my friend, anger at injustice, and bewilderment. Why would he hurt me? It doesn’t make sense.

I have a counsellor, and my partner is understanding. I’m looking for community voices to help me... feels less alone / more understood, or to help me make sense of the confusing aftermath... in spite of this abusive person not being a romantic attachment.",domesticviolence
VERY LONG POST. Is this abuse?,"I've been with my man for 15 years.
Within the first few months, he had slapped me very hard a few times, the first being after I said Usher was sexy. He told me not to disrespect him like that. 
At 6 months together we moved in together, and things changed a lot. I had moved 4 hours away from my family of be with him since he moved for work. I was attending college but eventually stopped. We didn't have internet so I stayed at home pretty much all day. I would clean and do my make-up and wait for him to be home. 
When he was home, he would basically ignore me, or insist that I perform oral sex on him, which I didn't mind, but if I said I didn't want to, he would berate me, sometimes hurt me, definitely forced it a bunch of times. 
I will say that I have a kink which is being forced, but a lot of the time, I wasn't into it and asked him to stop. He didn't. And if I cried he enjoyed it even more.
If he was annoyed by my fighting sometimes he would stop and throw me to the floor, calling me useless. (This has never stopped btw, 15 years in and he still does it). 
One night he came home from being at a bar with his sister (I was 18 and couldn't go). He was in a bad mood, I could tell. I tried to be nice but because he was so drunk, he wanted to have sex. He was having... difficulties...and said it was because I was overweight. I told him he could hurt me, (I'm a masochist and he's a sadist) and that helped, but he took it too far. He raped me and beat me for 4 hours. I know because I kept focusing on the digital clock on the bedside table. Bright red numbers counting the minutes of my terror.
A month after that I left, but 4 months of being with a worse guy and basically being homeless, I begged him to come save me. He showed up, got me off the drugs I was addicted to, and held me through my withdrawals. I suffered a miscarriage also, I didn't even know I was pregnant. He was so caring and sweet, and had done a lot of maturing while we were broken up.
We get an apartment together and it's like a fairytale. We don't fight, don't argue, we were madly in love again. We lived there for a year and it was great. Then he lost his career, we moved to a different apartment, and he started drinking heavily. We had a friend living with us and he drank with him all day and night..I'm talking they finished off entire handles each, and he started being controlling again. I had to keep the house clean and cook every meal for him and our roommate. He would punch my leg and keep digging his thumb into the bruise if I didn't do what I was supposed to do. He hated when I hung out with friends, and constantly accused me of cheating. At the time, Myspace was still a thing and he had numerous girls on there who he would go spend time with...I have since found out he was cheating.
After I finally kicked out roommate out for bringing over people who would steal from us, he sobered up and his behavior stopped being so bad. He would romance me and things got better. 
We got another place since we were kicked out of that place (long story) and though he was still very controlling thing calmed down again. 
Now I want to say that I love this man with everything I have. He doesn't react with rage, he doesn't beat me into a corner, he doesn't do what I consider to be abuse. Not since that first year together. But, in the 15 years we've been together, he goes through stages of being aggressive towards me. He insults me, forces sex or sexual acts, and then it stops. For months at a time sometimes. It's gotten to the point where I don't know how to feel normal. It's almost like I want him to be like that because it feels like our normal...? Does that make sense?? Not to mention that it has severely affected my sexual pleasure, I can't seem to enjoy myself if he isn't being aggressive or at least demeaning me in some way. It's something he's always done, and I don't know how to ""get off"" without it.
Flash forward to 2011, we moved again, again away from my family and friends, and again I try to go to school, and he gets a good job. But as before, I stop going to school and stay home all day. I clean, I cook, etc. We would rarely go out to town or anything, we were always home. He started to be a little more aggressive more often. Randomly. I didn't know what would set it off. One time I had a black eye, a very mild one, but it was there. He took me out to eat and go shopping, after making me do my makeup so it wasn't visible. While out he asked me how it felt to know people had no idea that he hurt me like that since we look so happy. I didn't know what to say but he put my hand on his crotch and he was as hard as a rock. 
Later he held me down and forced himself on me while slapping me harder than before on the same side where the bruise was. 
We lived out there for almost 10 years. This behavior became more frequent and more intense. My entire life became centered around him and what he liked or didn't like. My appearance, my housekeeping, everything. But again it wasn't like what I believed abuse to be. I've seen in movies or heard about it from people and it just seemed more dramatic and violent than what he would do. What he did was always cool and calm, he did it with such ease and confidence, I kept telling myself it was a game, he did it to turn himself on, because he's a sadist. We played around with bondage, role played, all the normal BDSM stuff so I just thought it was part of it. 
He'd do it for a while, constantly, then as before, he would just stop. And again I felt myself needing it. I'd need him to hit me, or be mean to me. I found myself feeling anxious or uneasy if he wasn't being dominant and mean. So I would ask. And if I brought up that I felt he went too far and said maybe this was abuse and not good, he would laugh and say I asked for it....which I did. 
So it was something I wanted...
Here I am, almost 16 years together with him and now it's scary. Again his drinking got bad and he has been doing it more. But it's different now. Now I tell him I don't want it. I cry. I fight. I break down and he just keeps doing it. He says he doesn't care that I don't want it. I tell him I'm afraid of him and he smiles and says good. He'll get drunk and throw me to the ground if I say something he considered too sassy or bitchy. He doesn't always hit me, but he holds me down and says awful things to me. He makes me cry. He reminds me I have nowhere to go. That if I leave I would just go running back to him because I can't do anything right, (I have some issues so he's not wrong) and that no other man would ever be able to deal with my baggage and no one would want an overweight woman in her 30s. The sad thing is he's right. He uses me past against me when he wants to make me cry. 
And every time he does this he gets hard. He can't help but touch himself as he's either hurting me or demeaning me and insulting me. He loves doing it. 
I love him. I know I do because we've been through so much and we really are like best friends. We understand each other so well, we have been so close since the day we met. And I have my own problems. I take responsibility for him getting a taste for hurting me, because I was curious about BDSM and that stuff when we were first dating, but I never imagined he was actually abusive. Or is this abuse? I don't have bruises all over my body, I don't cower in a corner, although I have before, he doesn't beat me senseless... it just doesn't feel like the abuse we all know about from ads and movies, etc. 
I don't fear for my life because he doesn't lash out like that, he hasn't escalated like I assume he should have by now,... IDK what to call this. 


Honestly I'm not sure why I'm sharing this because I have no intention of leaving him, he's my world. I am happy with him. My day to day life is good, we laugh all the time. If you saw us together you'd never know that sometimes he gets rough with me or says mean things. He is normal 80% of the time. 

Idk. Is this abuse?",domesticviolence
It's my fault I poked the bear,"My bf and I just moved into a 1 bedroom together 
We use to live with friends in a house then spent time at his moms. My bf and I have been together for 2 years. He has gotten physically violent by moving me or shoving me out of the way before we were in the one bedroom but never anything that crazy ridiculous. I take his stuff like his mouse or his charger and hide it when he would ignore me or stonewall me after a fight. He says I took him for granted so that's why he had to get away from me or zone out. We got a one bedroom so he could have his own space because he doesnt trust me to respect his space. It's TRUE I guess. When I wanna talk with him or discuss a fight, he just stonewalls for like a day or a week or a month. It's gotten better now he just disappears to his moms for a whole 24 hours... at one point he took my phone during a fight so I took his stuff and told him give it back or I'm gonna throw it and I did and I felt awful I havent hurt any of his thing since because I really never wanted to hurt anything of his but he had pushed me around and shoved me to the ground and said horrible things to me then took my phone and it was bad. About a 2 month ago hes got into it with his brother and his brothers friend at a a party at his moms and after he pinned his brother to the wall his brother followed him and they went back to our place so his sister gave me a ride. He texted me sorry. During the fight he got mean towards me because I was telling him to calm down. All he did was text me sorry. And when I got back the next evening I tried to talk about it with him and he was like ""why do I owe you anything"" and we got into a fight and again I wouldnt give him his space and I poked the bear as I always do and he throw me down and he covered my mouth and my nose so I couldnt breath... he also laid down on my head so my head was stuck between him and the floor btw my bf is a big guy like 250lb 6 feet tall huge linebacker. I am 5 feet tall 124lb Now here i am a few months later. I hid his keys so he couldn't leave I followed him every time he did try to leave and after all that when I wouldn't give him space in his room he shoved me he held me down hes hit me ""not that hard"" he said. Hes dragged me around by my hair or my feet he held me down and grabbed my breasts just to be disrespectful and he broke all of my art on my walls because I moved stuff around in his room to get his attention. Hes pressed my head into the ground and called me awful names and held my jaw closed so I couldnt scream. Covered my face multiple times. He kept hold me down and I always struggled and it hurt my arm and my back he stretched my leg and covered my mouth so I could cry while he pushed it upwards he grabbed me by my neck and pinned in weird backwards position .My shoulders hurt my body hurts my face hurts, not bad but it hurts. Hes left barely any Mark's but there are Mark's on my face and my neck. He kept hurting my eye while trying to cover my mouth. I called the police they showed I covered for him because none of this wouldve happened if I didnt poke the bear. I pushed his button I did whatever I knew I could to push his buttons. Idk why...idk why I do these things to trigger him I just want his attention I want him to care...idk oh I gave him his keys he left but all his stuff is here.",domesticviolence
Questions about my neighbour - can people change?,"\[Ontario, Canada\]  


I've posted before about my next door neighbour's abuse of his wife. Last fall the police finally arrested him and took him away. He was gone for a few months and now he's back.   


What is the likelihood in Ontario that he went through a batterer intervention program of some kind? Is it possible that he has changed? I know that without such a program the chances that someone changes are near zero but I don't know what happens with the programs.   


My place faces out the back of the house so I don't see the comings and goings from their house unless I'm outside anyway. I haven't seen his wife in months but I also haven't heard any raised voices or anything coming from their place since he has been back. I'm quite sure she's still living there though.",domesticviolence
I Need Help Staying Away,"I am so lucky.  I left today before anything got too physical.  He put out a lit cigarette on me about a year ago and has shaken me by the shoulders, but nothing more than that.  I can see now, though, how thoroughly he manipulates and emotionally abuses me.

I cheated early in our relationship, but have been faithful for five years.  Still, every issue we have is ""my fault"" because I destroyed him with this.

He has called me names, said really terrible things about me, and isolated me as thoroughly as he could.  He tells me that when I talk to other people about the things he says and does that I am being ""emotionally abusive"" and manipulative, because I want everyone on my side.  He says he's in charge of our marriage.  When he gets angry, it's always ""my fault"" for ""provoking"" him because ""I love drama"".  When I go away, usually for a day, ""we can't work things out if I'm ignoring him"".  He loves me so much.  He's so sorry.  He's in a really dark place.  He's just off drugs.  ""I don't love him"".  ""There's another man in my life"".  ""I am giving up"".  ""I don't really want this to work"".  

It usually works really well for him.  I'm usually back within a day or two.  The cycle starts over.  Promises made, honeymoon phase, promises broken, argument, feeling guilty, realizing it's not all my fault, leaving, feeling more guilty, and repeat.  

Please help me stay strong.  I can't do it alone.  I know we're all strangers, but I'm so scared I'll go back.  I love him so much.",domesticviolence
Everything feels impossible.,"He was always emotionally and verbally abusive. Lots of guilt and shame. Name-calling, blame, threatening, raking out all insecurities and possible triggers. 

And I still married him. Because I loved him. And because he was moving with the military to Europe. And because all attempts at leaving before were unsuccessful. 

So I moved with him. And all my hurt would come out in waves when I couldn't hold it in anymore. That's when he first hurt me by grabbing my arm, holding a hand over my face so I couldn't yell, leaving bruises in innocuous places. Flicking my nose.

""I'm so sorry. I love you so much. You just need to deal with your issues. I wouldn't have done it if you hadn't been freaking out.""

Then he took the first step to hurting me intentionally. He slapped my arm while we were cooking.

""Well you wouldn't shut up.""

Then the escalation. Putting my face between his arm and his hand because I was ""raising my voice."" Fighting him off led to me sitting on the floor where he knelt down, placed a hand around my throat and pushed. And then mocked me when I fought to get my breath back. 

""I love you. Don't leave. We can work through this. You want to stay married right? You promise?""

How could I say no. I was alone, in a foreign country, no family, no real connections yet. We hadn't even been married a year. 

""I'm tired of this petty bullshit. You stupid bitch. Fucking idiot. You're psychotic.""

He loved the mental health angle. He loved using specific words to incite my past struggles. Throwing my fight with self-harm in my face. Never praising that I had come so far and gotten so much better.

Then he finally hit me. And when I wouldn't stop bleeding, that's when he wanted to sit and talk. That's when I needed to calm down.

And I feel guilty. About *everything*. 

I called for help. Got taken away. Taken to the ER. Mandated into unrestricted reporting. Set up with interviews and Victims Advocates. Pictures were taken of my body, my face. Black eye, scratches, bruises. 

And I feel like it's not a big deal. I should just go home and apologize. I'm still in a foreign country. I have no family. I have one person willing to take me in temporarily. 

I have a job I love. I have a dog I adore. 

And I still feel guilty. I feel ashamed. I want to call him. Apologize. Over and over. Just go back. Let things blow over, move on. The world is already a dumpster fire, why should I make it harder on us. Why should I put his career and reputation in jeopardy.

He drank every night. And I just did it too. Seemed easier. It led to worse fights. But sometimes it just led to peaceful passing out. 

He is broken. Hurting. Full of pain, anger, and anguish. He has trauma he's never dealt with. I wanted to comfort him. I want to comfort him. 

I miss him. It's only been two days. Everything feels awful. Everything feels impossible.",domesticviolence
Tried to find shelter and was told they couldn’t help,"I’ve been in a long term relationship for seven years. We were supposed to get married a few months ago, but things didn’t pan out due to everything shutting down. Like many long term relationships we have had our ups and downs. The downs were typically arguments and discussions about boundaries. I’ve worked on not sharing so much of my anxieties and they never really thought they had a problem. 

Recently they have become violent. They threw a bookshelf, some remotes and after that a wooden box down the stairs that they claimed wouldn’t had hit me. I feel overwhelmed and unsafe. 

For over two months I have tried looking for apartments with no luck in my pay bracket (everywhere I go says I don’t make enough, but I don’t qualify for assistance). Insult to injury, I was told after multiple phone calls looking for shelter that I wasn’t poor enough to get help.  I was told after being honest about the $150 I had in my bank to get a hotel. “We can’t help you till you have used all resources.” I don’t know what I am supposed to do.

I feel suicidal, and all anyone can say is, “what did you do for yourself today?” I’ve tried to get help and it’s not working.",domesticviolence
Is violence irreversible? Was her violence provoked by me?,"Is violence irreversible after it has started? Like, if it's a box that has been opened, it generally becomes worse over time?

I always had a hard time hiding my temper when I felt like my ex was stupid when I helped her with her studies. She hated herself during such times, and hated me for making her hate herself. Bad feelings became verbal arguments, and then escalated to her hitting me to let the anger out.

When I initiated the breakup, her very rare violent behaviors soon escalated into full blow. She slapped, bit, threw things at me, pushed me up against the wall, threatened to harm me and my family, and once pointed a knife at me.

I know that she probably has deep-seated problems, but I feel guilty because I feel like my constant put-downs and dissatisfactions in her and in the relationship somehow contributed to her bad mental state and behavior, or at least that's what she told me. She was very sweet and gentle in the beginning, but somehow it turned into this.

So I guess what I wanted to ask was, is the relationship irreversible and can only get worse if somehow we maintain our connection? And am I right in feeling guilty in this, or is her problem only something bigger and I had a very small part to play?

Thank you for your insights.",domesticviolence
Boyfriend of nearly 6 years pushed me into getting 2 abortions against my wishes,"Tl;dr my boyfriend 15 years older than i forced me into getting two abortions under the pretence ""we weren't ready"". I am finally good enough to the standards he set and he still strings me along
My family never knew i was pregnant.


August 2018
I told him i was pregnant. He came to the appointment and had two shots of whiskey after. Handled it well at first. Second Prenatal appointment was awkward, refused prenatal vitamins, no smiles from either of us. He always wrestled me roughly because i was getting rid of it anyway it didnt matter. Asked me why i watched what i ate because it didnt matter. Yelled at me in the regular, avoided me.


I tried to eat a lot of parsley. It didnt work. Aspirin, didnt work. ""You cant clean a house, we arent ready for a baby what would it eat, fucking roaches?"" I cleaned the house hoping maybe i would be ready. Still, no. ""We dont have enough furniture. We need our own place, you're bad at cleaning, we need more time together alone, we need to travel""

Two years later i am still with him and we have bought a house, have furniture, I have a career, we have a car, i clean more now. Seeing a roach gives me that same flashback about why i wasn't good enough to keep my baby.

October 2018 
 i had a surgical abortion at 13 weeks, we had to drive 4 hours and stay over night to make the appointment. I was terrified as i had just gotten my car back after a car accident. I begged him that maybe we could make things work- he said they wouldn't. I covered all the mirrors in the house because i couldn't stand to look at myself, started drinking, defeated alcoholism later on and he hasnt changed a bit.

February 2019 My second abortion at 6 weeks was at home with pills by his coaxing. Nothing had changed.  I told him never again.",domesticviolence
Ex Keeps Coming Into Work,"My ex mistakenly came into my workplace again he immediately left so I feel its an appropriate response.

I have 2 jobs right now I could find a second job maybe elsewhere. Why put up with all the negativity when my boss disrespects me anyway- except I really do need the job.

Secondary fallout,No one really talks about the damage it does to familial relationships to be abused. My mother tends to either forget or purposefully forgets that I was abused and I’m vulnerable because of it. My brother too walked out of my life and then when my abusive relationship ended he thought that everything would go back to normal. I got used to not needing him in my life. He wants me to put more effort to make our relationship better. He tells me I pushed him out but he walked out. I just feel like a victim of my families absent- mindedness. I don’t know if it’s secondary fallout or really just a prime example of how fast people think you need to “get over it”,domesticviolence
Mental Abuse - I Need Help,"Hi there everybody,

This post isn't about me; its about my sister. 

About a year ago, my eighteen year old sister brought a guy back to my house (my moms...but still, I live here) and he was alright at first. For the first month or so, he was actually a decent person. However, after that first month, everything flipped upside down. The verbal abuse began little by little. Not knowing the true scope of this abuse - I felt bad for him. He talked about how bad of a life he had, and that he suffers from mental illness. As time went on, he would blame everything on mental illness. We found out my sister was pregnant, and it only made everything so much worse. I decided to hire him at a store I was managing, just for him to mix alcohol and Xanax while on the job, causing him to black out and literally destroy my car while running around almost naked.

I am absolutely terrified that he will put his hands on my sister already. Every night, I hear her screaming and crying, while he is yelling at her while making violent threats towards my family. When we defend my sister, she denies that anything is wrong, while he continues to threaten us in a house that he lives in for free. She refuses to let us kick him out, because that's the father of her child and he apparently took her virginity, she ""loves"" him. I dont want to repeat anything that has been said because it is very triggering. My parents have no idea what is truly going on because they're deaf and can't hear the entiee context of the arguments/abuse. I absolutely cannot handle this anymore. He is SO disrespectful towards my mom - he has even said that he cheated on her because she was signing and driving at the same time?? (She was asking directions so he could sell percocets...) We have screenshots of him threatening us. Now that the baby has been born and hes a few months old, the mental abuse continues. He threatens to take the baby across the country to his family's house on a daily basis, yet leaves my mom, the same person he talks trash about every single day, to take care of the baby while my sister suffers from post partum depression. If he ever leaves, we want to move into a place that he will never find.

What do i do? How do I get him out of the house? We are all terrified of him. 

There is so much more to the story, but I cannot think straight right now. I havent gotten more than two hours of sleep a day for weeks because of this going on.",domesticviolence
My husband keeps hitting me- I don't know what to do,"Hello, I have been in a relationship for 3 years and married for almost a year to a man. Our relationship is ugly. About a few months into dating, he hit me for the first time. I don't remember the reason why he hit me, as most of the time it is over the smallest of arguments, but it happened. I have a background of child abuse and child sexual abuse and so when he was sincerely apologetic, I forgave him. We have really beautiful highs and terrible lows. There has been countless times where he has forced me to pleasure him, and he has been too rough and would hit me really hard, and wouldn't stop when I wanted him to. He has hit me many times during arguments, and has left me bruised on countless occassions. I've been choked many times, and once he did it while we were in public and going for a walk. We were arguing over something and he started choking me so hard that i started blacking out. It was dark and there was nobody around except for people in the distance who walked past us and I pretended like nothing was happening. 

I am not a perfect person. Most of the time, I feel like I deserve it. I have a horrible tendancy to keep talking and I think out of frustration, he hits me to get his message across. I speak over him, we call each other all sorts of names, he says I disrespect him and so he hits me out of frustration. I don't know what to do. I love him. I can't see myself out of this. I come from a Muslim family and his family is Muslim too. I can't imagine going back to my parents as I am scared about what he might do. We have just had another fight where he got a knife and threatened to kill me and then kill himself. Then he grabbed his stuff and left. He took our house keys with him so I know he will be back. I have no place to go. I have a good job but he has access to all of my finances and puts my money into his own savings account so I currently have no money to move out. I want to dissappear completely. But I'm torn. I love him. I don't know what to do.",domesticviolence

I’m so sick of reliving it constantly in my head even though it’s long over.,"I’ve been no contact with my abusive ex for nearly a year, with a protective order in place. I’m safe. But some days I just sit here ruminating and reliving everything that happened and I just want it be out of my head.

I wish I could get my memory erased. I’m sick of thinking about him pinning my down, kicking me, telling me how disgusting and ugly I was. Telling me no one would ever put up with me. That I’m a psychopath and I’m lucky that he loved me. Threatening suicide every time I left. Crying in front of police officers. Leaving my work and seeing his car sitting there waiting for me. Just KNOWING there a verbal and physical assault waiting for me. Seeing him walking into the bar I was at and getting embarrassed in front of everyone. I was told everyday that I was fat, stupid, unlovable, white trash, unintelligent and there was always someone better than me, someone who he could “get with.” I spent so many nights laying awake wondering if I’d see the sunrise. I’d try to just sleep and he’d rip off the blankets and kick me onto the floor.

I didn’t fucking deserve any of it. I’ve tried to work through everything in therapy. But day after day I find myself reliving the trauma, and feeling seething anger and a desire for some sort of penance or revenge. Every silver Aveo I see, I tense up, worried it’s him. I just want to forget. I don’t want to live the rest of my life hating someone and having them take up so much space in my brain. I want every thought to just go away.",domesticviolence

I'm an adult, age 19+ with no idea how to get out of this mess, i don't fear him as much as i hate him, but i can't seem to get an opportunity to get evidence against him, and if law enforcement is around, he plays calm until out of the area if he was in an episode... any attempt to get evidence has usually passed before i can do anything, rest of the family doesn't seem to want to/have the ability to do anything about it, so it seems like it's on me to do something instead... any suggestions would be much appreciated... i feel like the opportunity has passed to get him enough to keep him away, but i guess that's why i'm here, i hope the first part doesn't take away from the seriousness of the situation... money isn't exactly easy to come by and being in a situation where you're cooped up inside your home isn't helping... and unfortunately for me and the family i care about, mother and siblings, he's smart enough not to do it if there's a camera within line of sight to him...",domesticviolence
Anyone have an abuser say it was self defense?,"Hey. New here.
Has anyone had a partner that slapped and or hit them and then said it was ok because it was self defense? It clearly wasn't and I think she is just telling herself whatever story she needs to feel ok with giving me a black eye etc.
My ex would binge drink about every other month, sometimes less, and verbally abuse me and or hit me.
Yes, I yelled and yeah, I broke my own things. Example: my little acoustic guitar.
Anyway, just here for support and to somehow come to terms why I allowed this person to abuse me for 5 years.
Hope I didn't break any rules and I'm glad I found this place.",domesticviolence
I'm at a loss of what to do with my life,"24f

Without going into too much detail I'm a citizen of a country that opresses women and living in a country that opresses women. My father makes being a woman even harder with his strict religious rules and beliefs. I have been raised to be submissive while my whole being shouts for me to escape but I don't see how.

If i ever said where i lived no one would touch me with a 10 foot pole because there is nothing that can be done that will make my situation better in this country. Only a miracle would change my situation.

There is no support for abused or opressed woman in this country

I don't know how to escape or where to escape.

While I have no physical marks or bruises my inside is filled with the scars of emotional and physiological abuse. I need help but no where to turn to, no one to go to, no one to support me, no one who would listen.

Will I stay opressed my whole life? What's the point of living a life like that? I don't see any light at the end of the tunnel. It's dark all around",domesticviolence
Finally seeing the abuse as they really were.,"I have been out of the relationship for one whole month. Well, we are still texting a few times daily, so I am not technically out of the relationship yet, and perhaps won't for some time. However I am gradually starting to see the abusive patterns in our relationship, and view things as they really were.

I wasn't really wrong when I felt frustrated she couldn't understand it when I explained programming concepts to help her study. I always tried my best to constrain the frustration when teaching her, but she would always pick it out and lash out at me in return. I realize that I wasn't wrong when I repeatedly told her I was having doubts about the relationship, it was an attempt of open communication and it wasn't a sin, or that I was putting her down and deliberately making her feel inadequate. I wasn't really wrong when I wanted out, despite the fact that she followed me to a new country when I gave her a sort of ultimatum (""If you don't come to Canada, we'll have to break up."").

She is trying to layer all these guilt upon me, and even now, I still feel guilty and responsible for the above things I did.

I went back to the island one week ago, because I missed her like hell. I missed her so much that my heart felt weak and my hands trembled. It is funny, how I had been pondering breakup for the majority of the day, but ever since I really went out, I could miss her so much. My emotional dependence on her was undeniable. Every day she waited for me in front of the fireplace. She used to be so happy when I returned, and she would care about my life and health, cook for me, and listen to all the silly and the most out-of-the-world things I had to say. I missed having someone always there for me.

But the bad times, oh they were so bad. Her opinion of me shifts drastically during those episodes where she felt she wasn't ""understood."" She gaslights me (""No I haven't said that"", ""no I didn't do it"", blatantly tells me that my feelings are unimportant to her, tells me I am too needy, that all my future partners will cheat on me because of that, says that me and all my family are psychopaths, and that I won't have any achievements in life, that my pouring out my heart to her made her feel speechless, etc. That I am selfish, fake and have a weak soul.

The days pending the breakup which I initiated were the worst. She blamed me for all her problems, and accused me of not caring about her at all. She slapped, choked, kicked, bit, threw things at me, pushed me up against walls, and once pointed a knife at me. She would stand in front of my room at night with ""that look,"" refused to let me sleep and gave me verbal threats for half an hour, sitting at my bed and staring at the wall. In the daytime she kept talking to herself. I was so scared.

She is normal at most times and in front of others, especially now which is weeks after I left. I know she misses me as well, but not to such an extent as I missed her. She easily closes off her emotions, as she herself said, and according to articles of personality disorders. She would think of me randomly during the day, but I guess that's basically it.

I realize that it's going to be an uphill battle, perhaps filled with loneliness, but also filled with freedom. I know that going back to the island where I used to, and somewhat still, feel like it's a home, isn't the answer to all this. Last time I went, I relived the sweetest times, but then triggered one of her episodes and got slapped, blamed and threatened in return. I won't contemplate going back to her again. She is not likely to change in the following months and even years to come.

This is what I have been thinking about today, and I am posting this out to share with you all.",domesticviolence
It never ends,"Feeling pretty low, thought I'd post.

My wife was on the downhill of an abusive marriage when we met.  Initially we were just friends, but I made her feel better, so she could take more of his abuse but also stand up for herself more.  He had stopped being physically violent by that point, he's 6'3 265+, so for him it was more verbal and punching walls or threats since he had established he could best her up anytime he just had to remind her.

She hid most of it, but I became a huge issue for them and I got used to him calling to threaten me ect once she grew numb.

Fast forward a few years, she left, eventually we got married, good times.  But they had joint custody and he started back up, screaming at her (after convincing  her she couldn't record), threatening and intimidating ect.  It escalated into stalking while I was deployed and that's when she finally told me the whole history and it clicked just how violent he could get.  Cops wouldn't take it seriously (NC isn't too progressive), and I started learning how little the system knows about its own laws.  I got smarter, but it takes FOREVER to build a case on someone who now knows they are being watched, dozens of reports, cops know him it's just waiting for a big blowup now.  The assumption is I'm here to protect her now, problem is they also tell me how fast I'll get arrested for doing it.

Brings us to today.  We show up to drop her daughter off, in the police station parking lot like always.  Ex gets out with his mom.  Daughter walks over to grandma, they go to get in his van.  He's still standing there.  I say nothing, no eye contact, wait until my wife is in the car, and as I'm getting in he starts coming towards us.  I pull out my phone, start trying to record and he starts bowing up saying he wants to fight ect.  She's yelling how rediculous this is, tells me to just go.  His mom grabs him, we pull off.

Wife doesn't stop yelling though because......

SHE IS YELLING AT ME!!! 

Now shes mad because she thinks I instigated it.  Same guy that called to cancel her daughters counseling appointment yesterday, same guy who immediately started blowing her phone up about me today being there, like I always am, on and on.

She knows he's dangerous and violent, and uses any excuse to not let their daughter call (1 call on his time a month, maybe) but when does reality set in for her that what he's doing is controlling and he wants to isolate her, so trying to get along with him is a no win game.  He has repeatedly tried to lure her out alone for various reasons and even shown up at times when he doesn't think I'll be there.

It feels some days like I can't win.",domesticviolence
How do I get myself to stop caring for my abuser?,"I just recently ended my relationship with someone who was very very abusive to me a few days ago. It got to the point where he slammed me to the ground, the wall, and on the bed. He's choked me, pressed on my eyes, kicked and punched me. I know this all sounds ridiculous and anyone in their right mind would immediately know to switch gears and not care for this person. I don't know why I find myself still caring for this person. We had so much history together and he's tried to seek therapy himself but still repeats these behaviors. There were times where he was able to remain calm and asked that he leave so he could be in a better headspace to return and have civil conversations, but all that seem to go out the window when he snaps. 

 I don't like that I still care and miss him. I've blocked all contacts because I know that's what needs to happen because it got out of hand and he still tries to call me from an unknown number. Im afraid I might cave in one day and pick up. I know I shouldn't. Also, this is very embrassing to admit, but I can't help but desire our sexual chemistry again. I know that's not a healthy love, but i don't know how to wrap my head around why I feel the way I do. With this whole covid 19 shelter in place, it's been hard to get a support group going. I've already called the national domestic abuse hotline and they've linked me to my local group, but even they've haltered meetings and so I'm looking for any support I can get so that I don't go back into making the same mistakes again, thank you for taking the time to read this.",domesticviolence

How to assist a victim?,"betterfindurheart1907:34 PM
Yo shut the fuck up you troll! If you are really in trouble find a damn shelter. Don’t blame strangers for your mistakes. At least protect your son! If you’re with your abuser then that is your fault no one else’s! Walk to the damn gas station and get gas. You dumb bitch!""

ANOTHER PERFECT RESPONSE

""You know what lady, short of someone giving you cash, there is nothing to help your immediate situation. I’m guessing you conveniently ran out of gas far from resources.
Probably time to start waking to the nearest gas station with your kid and dog, and ask there if someone can help you. Sitting on your device arguing with people is a waste of time. Considering you have no gas, wonder what will happen when you have no access to internet? Batteries don’t last forever""

I'm posting those since the mods aren't doing shit. Trying to defend myself and everything gets locked. Rules only apply to certain people. Y'all do me a favor when the next mother/kid is killed by the abuser don't ask or say ""why didn't she just leave"". The abuser has already alienated the victim from friends and family and made sure there is no resources available to leave.

"Caught girlfriend cheating in chat, she pulled a gun","I was dating my now 43 year old ex-girlfriend for 5+ years. We've had serious issues here and there, I've been thrown out and left a bunch of times. She's cheated on me on Tinder 6+ times. She was always trashing me to her friends on social media. One of her friends egged her on to keep cheating on me. She almost left me for someone else once. Her adult son went crazy one morning, and threatened me with a knife, and stabbed our kitchen table.

Our issues stemmed from a bunch of different sources: her son (20) was a drug addict and a drug dealer who didn't clean up after himself. Her oldest daughter (23) was a drug addict that was also a cutter and was bulimic. Her younger daughter(18) was also a drug addict and later became a drug dealer. She had one son who was a good student in school who had no real issues. (19).

She was former Army going through a divorce with a somewhat indifferent husband who had moved on with a younger woman. I had been divorced 2 years, and was living alone, when she was involuntarily separated from the Army for high year tenure, and was about to lose her housing.

We had known each other in high school, but not well. We hung out a few times. In fact, I asked her to marry me when I was 18 and she was 16, but she said ""no"".

We began talking on Facebook Messenger, and she would go into another room and talk to me, for hours and hours. We got along great. Eventually she surprised me and came down to see me, December 26, 2014, and stayed for a while, until things got crazy back home. She bought me a car, as I had lost mine in some wrangling with my ex-wife during my divorce, an old.Buick, but hey, it was a car, and I loved her for helping me.

She left again in February,  but we reunited on Valentine's day for a Hozier concert in Seattle, which she arranged and paid for. She had gotten severance pay from the Army. She lived off this for a good while, and didn't work for around 3 months or more. 

It was a good time, and I loved her, but even then, I knew I couldn't please her. She had a huge sex drive, and I had suffered a bit from erectile dysfunction. I had some pills, but they were old, but I had underlying problems with my blood pressure and blood sugar that were causing problems.

Eventually, she moved back in with me, and we had a great life, just laughing and talking and spending time together. Her oldest daughter was living on her own in D.C., her youngest daughter and oldest son was living with her dad in San Antonio, and her younger son, the food student, came to live with us, and she brought her 3 dogs, 2 golden retrievers and a small terrier mix.

Eventually, things got bad at the exhusbands place, so the you get daughter and oldest son came to live with us in a small, 700ft 1 bedroom apartment. 

Eventually, we had to move. The daughter kept skipping school and getting the property management to let her in where they could see the 3 large dogs, so we were asked to leave, also based on occupancy. We had 5 people in there.

When we moved to the new neighborhood, my girlfriend asked her oldest daughter if she wanted to live with us, and she brought her Russian live-in boyfriend, and broke up with him on the same day, but he continued to live with us for a year. My girlfriend at this time was a nurse, so she make good money. I wasn't making very much, and I felt like such a mooch. I had paid all the bills at our old apartment, as I had when I lived alone, but I had little left over after child support was taken out. I helped where I could, I always did the dishes, the laundry, cleaning the whole house, vacuuming...I tried to make her life easier in ways that I could, since I couldn't help in financial ways. I loved her deeply, but I always felt a bit outnumbered and outvoted, and had no real say in anything.

A year or so later, I lost my job, and was unemployed for a year. I took great care of the house, but she despised my not working. She was paying for everything related to the house, and I was taking care of it, but I really wasn't that big of a burden, I was cleaning up after 4 kids that weren't mine, and one live in boyfriend, occasionally taking them to school when they missed the bus, or I would drive them to work. At some point, her oldest son began bringing drug addicts and derelicts around the house, and I had words with him about it. My girlfriend hated me disciplining her kids, but she wasn't doing it, either. She let them run all over her, cursing her out, calling her names, disrespecting her...something I put a stop to. You'd think she'd appreciate that, but she felt it was causing a problem in her relationship with her kids.

She began going on Tinder and hooking up with random guys for quickies. Once, she even let one guy watch once. She began seeing a guy named Jim, leaving me alone with her kids while she went to have sex with him. She would lie and say she was going to fo look at a table for sale or go to a thrift shop.

Things got real bad for a while, when the oldest daughter threw her boyfriend out, and turned to alcohol. She would get driven home by the bartender so they could go home. She would dump hundreds of dollars out on the ground and leave her cellphone, and new iPhone, in the street.

Her oldest son had gotten thrown out of two schools, and was now on his 3rd time as a senior. He and his friends stole a wallet from a truck at a nearby construction site, which brought the police to our home. They drew guns on me, demanding I turn him over. He wasn't even home. Our house became the bad house in the neighborhood where the cops were always called.

My girlfriend helped me find another job, and let me drive her truck, while she sold her car to her son so he could go to his academy school for special students across town. She was a nurse for the same company I worked for, though in different cities. We could communicate on Skype to one another all day. It was beautiful. I still didn't make enough ro support her, but I would come home, and clean, and do car repairs, and build projects for her. Anything she asked for.

Eventually, the youngest daughter became a problem, with drugs and alcohol and skipping school, and one got her boyfriend to try and run me over with his car,...and she moved back with her father. She moved back 6 months later, with a new drug habit, and was even worse. She was climbing in and out of windows, lying about working, and staying gone days at a time. The oldest daughter had herself committed, met a friend inside, tried to convince us the friend should move in, and got a job as a waitress in a strip club.  The oldest son kept bringing trashy friends over in the middle of the night, making our house smell like pot, and sneaking his younger sister out for parties. The oldest sister gave her alcohol and she almost killed herself with alcohol poisoning, and the police came, having been called because she had been drinking on Facebook Live.

The oldest son came home high, and shit in the backyard. My girlfriend confronted him, and he started acting like he was going to hit her. I shouted from upstairs, and he came up the steps at me with a knife. My girlfriend called the police, and he was arrested. She bailed him out, which caused a fight. We worked through that, she got him his own place, the youngest daughter found some drug counselor to live with, and my girlfriend had a fight with the oldest daughter when she came home drunk again, and the oldest daughter moved out, too, leaving just the good student son, who then found a friend to move out with, leaving just the two of us again.

My girlfriend had quit her job, and went back to college to be a doctor. It was hard and stressful. The truck died, and I had built up enough credit to buy a new car. My girlfriend bought two more cars, whixh i fixed up for her, was in accidents in both, and got one more last car.

Things were okay. She had too much time on her hands, and began starting fights when I came home because she wanted to do something and I was just trying to relax. I still couldn't match her libido. 

Eventually I come home, and she tells me she has started talking to a cousin she hadn't spoken to in 10 years. I don't think much of it at first, but she's going into closed rooms to talk to him. I catch a few screens of their chats online, and they're really suggestive for cousins. I mentioned it, and she said there was nothing to worry about.

She had been repairing her credit. She wanted to buy a house. Waived in an HOA, and the rent was terrible. She got her VA home loan, and we were preparing to move. We had found this house she loved because it was on a lot of land for her plants and dogs, and it had a handicap accessible bathroom off of the master bedroom, which she said she selected for me, because I have bad knees. It wasn't one floor, like we had talked about, but it was nice. It was older, and the wiring was crazy, and there were lots of things that needed to be done. It was a good project house, and I would be kept busy.

We're in the midst of moving and packing, and she's hiding in other rooms, talking to this ""cousin"". I eventually open the door, and ask just what is going on. This was similar to the way I was talking to her when she was about to move on from her ex-husband, so my suspicion was going off. 

For the scene I started, she broke up with me, and I was told it was over, that she didn't want me to move with her, al.ost like it was planned that way. She had a meeting with her kids, and had a chat with her friend that was always pushing her to leave me, that she was either going to not buy the house and just move in with her cousin, or buy the house and all the kids could move back in because apparently I was the problem, and now I was out of the picture. 

Her kids expressed interest, especially the older waitress daughter and the drug addict son. They hadn't had particularly successful stints living on their own.

I made one last ditch effort to save the relationship, and she relented. I was back in. She made the announcement to the kids, and the oldest waitress daughter flat out said it was a mistake, according to the relationship advice she read on Tumblr. 

We moved. Some days the kids would help. Most days they didn't. I unloaded 2 Uhaul trucks by myself. I was trying to do all the things my girlfriend always wanted me to do. I took my Viagra, even though it used to make me feel bad, and we started having sex 3 to 4 times a day. We were making bold plans for this new house. Her drug addict son moved in. The waitress daughter, too. I tried to make peace. They made their plans when I wasn't going to be here.

We were doing really great, except she was still talking to this cousin an awful lot, even talking calls when we were eating together or having a conversation. 

She had made some plans to visit this cousin and the rest of her family, supposedly. She wasn't forthcoming with the date, but apparently it was a plan put in motion in the brief period we were broken up.

About two weeks before the visit, she starts to go cold. She doesn't want sex anymore, because I had satisfied that craving. She didn't want to kiss me if I was too sweaty. She was pushing me away, and talking to him more. Evey time I said something about it, she said I was being insecure. 

Last Saturday, I ask when she was leaving. She said June 3rd. She said she didn't know when she was coming back. That was how it was when she came to stay with me, too. I said something about it. I asked if she was going to unblock me on Facebook (she had blocked me when we broke up), so I could chat with her all the time when she was with him, like he was foing when she was with me, or if I was her dirty little secret.

She got up and left for an hour. Then she suggested we unpack some boxes in the bedroom together. She starts saying she never goes out, never gets to wear these pretty dresses. I don't take her anywhere nice. She leaves again for four hours this time. She comes back and tells me not to bother unpacking my things. ""There's no trust, no respect, and you hate my kids"".

I was floored. It wasn't even an argument. It was if her mind was made up by someone else. She was dead cold, and wanted nothing to do with me. I began packing my things back up again.

I try to make peace. Nothing. I try to ask her daughter what I should do, and I notice her daughter is saying the same things her mother said. I had accused her of a crime, of incest, and that was insulting. 

It gets to a point where I'm ready to leave, apparently for good. My ex-girlfriend says she was going to offer for me to stay until I found a place, if i fixed up her house with all the things i had planned to while she was gone, and maybe she would miss me, and maybe we could talk when she got back, whenever that was. Her oldest daughter was hiing to move out in a month, her oldest son was going to move in with his dad in two months, she needed someone to watch her dogs.

I agreed. At least it was a small glimmer of hope, and I had a place to stay, and didn't have to drastically alter my life. I was still heartbroken she was going to leave with our relationship in shambles.

There were little hints she still cared. She cracked jokes with me. I collect Transformers and she still went down the aisle and would tell me what they had. She had watched on our Ring cam and saw me throw away a McDonald's bag, so she knew I was eating, despite being heartbroken. 

I had made about of changes last time we broke up. I was making more now. I changed my debit pin to her birthday, like she always wanted. I made my Facebook profile pic a pic of us together. I was going to a therapist. I was looking into getting my disability pay increased. I was in line for a transfer and a promotion. I had found a program that would pay me to take care of her for her disability, that would make up in the money she was losing from college. She was using the GI Bill, but Covid was keeping her home in a virtual class, and that gave her extra time, and she spent that extra time talking to her cousin. I had told her I had some paperwork to fill out, and I had an interview the next day, and they money would be enough to cover the mortgage or my half of the combined bills. Finally, I was going to be able to contribute in a meaningful way. I had given her sex, and she still canned me. Now I was about to give her a large amount of money. 

I came home, and she was mowing the grass. She was looking very sexy, wearing this black top I always thought looked good. I told her I needed to talk to her, she said she'd come inside when she was finished. I thought for sure shed be happy, and consider taking me back. When we had talked earlier about all they ways I helped her, it almost seemed like she had gone soft again, and realised I really did love and care for her, and showed it in the best ways I could. 

I went upstairs and saw her laptop was open. I moved the mouse, it was on Facebook. I looked at the chat. There it was.

A lurid sex chat with her cousin. She was talking about it gushing like Hoover dam, and about how she couldn't wait to be with him. There were nudes exchanged. A video chat. He said she went three deep. She said it tasted great. It was perverse. It was dirty. It was very much like the sex we had the month before.

Her daughter had told me there was nobody else and I was an asshole for accusing her of a crime, something my girlfriend echoed later, letting me know the daughter had planted the seeds of the breakup. She had even said she wanted all of her mother's attention and felt she couldn't get that when we were doing well together, but here it was: she was chatting with someone else, and that someone else was her cousin, and it was incest. 

I wasn't crazy. I knew it all along. She just kept me for the move. She just kept me for the labor. Now she was going to go fuck her cousin after breaking up with me so she could justify and legitimize it and say it wasn't cheating because we weren't together. 

I called her into the kitchen and confronted her with what I saw. She immediately grew irate. She demanded I delete it from my phone. I refused. She said ""You're going to ruin me! Destroy me!""

She went into the bedroom. I took this chance to leave. When she came out of the bedroom, she had her gun in her hand. I went into the garage. She locked and loaded the gun behind me. It was a Walther PPX. There was no safety. That gun was ready to fire.

She shoved my back, forcing me into the dryer. I shoved her away, and went for the door...I went out and through the gate and felt the gun in my back. I spun around to get by her and close to my car. She stopped me, and kicked at my bad knee twice, then thrust her knees toward my knee or groin. She grabbed at the pocket for my phone. I dodged all her attacks, and was holding the gun back with one hand. She kept saying my name. I asked what she was afraid of. She shoved the barrel of the gun into my chest, I felt the barrel was right at my heart. There was anger and evil in her eyes. I heard her say my name through pursed lips and clenched teeth. I heard her finger on the trigger.

We were now at the end of the driveway. I had always told her, she or her son was one day going to kill me, and to save jail time, say it was suicide. It would be believable. I've been depressed since our breakup, and everyone knew that.

I couldn't get to my car. It was too far to go anywhere by foot to be out of range. I had accepted it: I was about to die.

Then i saw a young woman on the sidewalk across the street, and shouted out ""Please hell.me, she's going to kill me, she has a gun! Please call 911!"" and the young woman did, and reported what she saw.

The police came, and arrested my ex-girlfriend for aggravated assault with weapon, and battery, and I left alone, heartbroken, and confused.",domesticviolence

10:05 PM

I went to hangout with Chad. Just to have a good time, hang out.
Little did I know I was walking into the story of my own attempted murder.
Everything was going great. We were having a great time. For the first week anyway.
He kept trying to get me to message his ex. He thought I knew where she was at. He thought I had his phone tapped and that I was working for the feds, and was trying to set him up. I couldn't give him any answers either and that started pissing him off. My last week with him was pure hell.. torture. Literally.
It started one morning, he'd been up all night. Picked me up by my throat, started choking me. Hit me a few good times. Then while I was down started pressing his knee into my chest. Told me he'd just keep doing that until I stopped breathing. That it would look like I had a heart attack. No one would know any different.
He wouldn't let me leave at this point. Threatened my family. Took my phone. Even started messaging my friends and everyone. That night he was supposed to go see his mom at the hospital and made me go.
Going down Route 2 he continued hitting me. So I opened my door and tried to jump out but he grabbed my hair and pulled me back in. I kicked and fought but he was stronger than me. That's when he took me down by the river. Saying everything would be fine and he'd let me live if I would just tell him the truth and answer his questions.
But I didn't have his answers. So I was beat some more. He was going to kill me and throw me in the river.
Then he said that would be too easy. No, he was gonna keep me alive and torture me until I gave him answers.
So we went back to his house.
Monday, March 9, 2020 is the day he slipped. One small mistake.
He took me to St. Mary's in Huntington, WV with him so he could visit his mom. Told me to wait in the truck.
Soon as he turned the corner and was out of sight I took off. Ran to the emergency room while I had 911 on the phone telling them what was going on.
I'm safe for the time being. But I'm terrified.. if he finds me, I'm dead.

"Trigger hard after watching Epstein show, my take away","My take away from watching the mini series:

5 years on and the abuse from my ex still affects me?,"Hi guys, hope that this is the right place to post as I’ve been considering writing this for a while. I’m not sure how to start this but I’ll give a bit of background. Basically I’m a male and I met my ex in my final year of uni and I think I was swept away by the fact that she was smart, wealthy, etc etc and couldn’t believe that she actually wanted to be with me. She was great with my friends at first and when I graduated and wanted to stay in the city, I was happy to take up her offer of living with her until I found my own place and the following year we would move closer to my hometown where she would study for her masters degree. This is where it all changed...

(Sorry guys, on reread this is quite long so feel free to just skip to the last paragraph if you want to see my question)

Over the next two years she became increasingly violent and aggressive. She would dig her nails into my arm and punched me in the head on several occasions. Once, I put my arm up in self defence and it caused a bruise on her wrist which she would constantly use against me to make me feel like a bad person. My friends who she liked at first became “bad influences” and just the mention of them would flare up arguments so eventually it became easier not to see/mention them to avoid this. She changed the plan to move near to my hometown without telling me by enrolling for her masters at the same uni. Near the end of the relationship my mental health was struggling, especially following the death of my grandad and I wanted to seek counselling which she wouldn’t allow me to because I’d be a “weirdo”. I finally found the strength to leave her when she said she was going for dinner with friends and by chance I spotted her having a romantic meal with another guy.

I have too many instances of abuse and those are just some that I can pull from the top of my mind and I know that they’re not half as bad as what some have experienced on this thread. I’ve since moved back to my hometown and my friends have welcomed me back with open arms which I don’t deserve. I’ve also met the girl of my dreams who is the most intelligent person I’ve ever met, so understanding, supportive and exactly what I’ve always wanted in a partner. We own a house together and are due to be married next year.

The point I’m trying to make is that I often find myself feeling bitter towards my ex and all of those years that she has taken from me. I often think about the fact that she is free to do what she wants and that some poor guy is probably being abused by her right now and that could be down to me. I’m not sure that there’s much I can do now and I’ve tried to help friends who seem to show signs of being in controlling relationships but it never seems to scratch the itch. I also want to stop feeling like my friends secretly hate me for abandoning them. I thought that this would subside over the years but I find myself here after 5 years just as bitter as ever and wondering what I can do to move forward.",domesticviolence

Online stand up against child abuse,"Come and join us 🤗 see link below

Since the lockdown, victims of domestic violence have become even more vulnerable. Have you ever considered what abuse does to a child’s soul? What it is like to survive years of abuse, and process the trauma to become able to live a balanced adult life?
While Hungarian politicians keep humiliating women in public, Hungary has recently said no to the Istanbul Convention, which protects women and children from abuse. The real reason behind this decision is not that the country is completely prepared to help victims and prevent violent acts, nor is it the foreign policy (migration) arguments the government proposes, but their total indifference to the problem.
However, this is a problem that knows no country borders and appears everywhere. Come with us on May 31st, children’s day – let’s stand up for those who need protection the most!
The whole event will be in Hungarian and English.

"Schizophrenic brother who is abusing his wife, now has a vendetta against me(his sister)","Ever since my brother (Luis) came back from jail in December, he's been an ever looming presence, ruining the peace and joy we've had the 4 years he was gone.

He's schizophrenic but also violent and would assume my other brother Tony or my dad would be hooking up with his wife.  

One of my other brother's Tony was outside throwing some trash away at night and my brother Luis started shouting at him saying that my brother fucked his wife, even though Tony has a girlfriend. They ended up fighting and Tony had bloody cuts on him from the fight. They stopped once my dad pulled them apart.

The day after my brother ended up chocking his wife and almost killing her. He left bruises on her arm. She said she would call the cops and he ended up running away into the street.

He came back later threatening us if we called the cops and saying his wife was reading our minds. I ended up kicking him because he was getting close to me.

The police came by because someone called. I ran to them and told them my brother had abused and almost killed his wife. They talked to me and asked me what had been going on. My brother's wife denied the abuse and the bruise, but I told them that it was in fact caused by my brother. They took him away, although my brother did try fighting the police at some point.

They have 3 kids who have witnessed the violence going on, who will be telling the court what they witnessed. 

My brother is in jail for a bit before they do the court stuff but I'm really scared as he now is out to get me. 
I'm glad I told the police because my mom and my brother's wife kept denying the abuse.

I just hope he goes to jail forever. 
He's on parole and has 2 strikes already, so hopefully if he's charged with domestic abuse I don't have to fear him coming to kill me.

This has been so stressful and even though I wasn't being abused, I know how violent my brother is and how mad he was when my mom told him that the police talked to me.

I wanna know how to protect myself from him because I'm scared.",domesticviolence
My boyfriend threw a clothes horse at me,"Hello guys,

I am very confused right now. My bf (26) of two years threw a clothes horse at me (23) two weeks ago.

 I have met this guy at my university in a very depressing time of my life. I grew up with my grandparents, my parents left me alone as a child, my dad abandoning me two times for two years. My grandpa had just passed away. I started going to therapy, which I am still doing and it helped me a lot, but he also helped me and was there for me, then I needed to cry and was very caring and empathetic. In fact he helped me heel a lot.

I really fell in love with him and wanted to become the best version of my self, kind and mindfull and empathetic. I was ready to work on every issue we had, learn to communicate better, meet his needs and be there for him...

So here is the thing, he always gets very upset and angry over small things. He starts crying then he has to do something in the household, so I end up doing it. I think he is a workaholic. He works up to ten hours every single day... In our two years of relationship he took like three weeks off. He says he feels empty and depressed then he is not working. He can't fight. Every time we have an argument, he rather leaves the room or stares at his phone. Two times he had punched a wall in front of me, blaming me for it. ""I push his buttons"". Then he started throwing stuff against the wall. He won't talk to me until I apologize for the argument (It is normally just me pointing out small things, that hurt or bother me). 

This time it was about my grandmothers birthday. I wanted to visit her and for him to come along. He struggled a said, that he would rather work. I got really sad and told him that it makes me said he doesn't care and he had an outburst and threw the clothes horse at me. I raised my arm and it left a scratch. Then he went silend and I packed my things and went away.

He then wrote a really long letter apologizing and we agreed to talk again a few weeks from then, after cooling down. And I don't know what to do. If I should try to work things out, find another way to solve our problems or just leave it and suffer a bit. I know that no relationship is perfect and that everthing needs work...

So here is the thing. I kind of know he can be very kind and creative and playfull and he really helped me. I don't want to hurt him and a part of me is excusing all this I guess. Like he is very stressed, works very hard, his mom has a depression and his parents really are always fighting, even getting violent... And I really have compassion for him and don't want things to end. On the other hand... It is not only this. He is so disrespectfull with my creative work, insulted my believes... One time he wanted me to write a two page essay, explaining why my policial opinion on a topic is wrong (It wasn't just the same as his). 

He cares a lot about what people think and gets upset then I am joking around with my friends and having fun, like just dancing around with my best friend Eva. He sais that this embarases him. 

Don't know... Could it all just get worse? Am I co-depended? Don't know... A part of me believes it is all my fault, that I am being to harsh, then expressing my concerns... I can get very sad sometimes, too and just lie in bed a cry. I also get angry, then he insults me... But I never try to harm him on purpose and I am trying to grow as a person and communicate better every time... Also noting that my dad is a narcissist and he wrecked my judgedment of people and situations... I feel so brainwashed.",domesticviolence

A friend's friend is a victim of domestic violence...,"Wales, U.K


How can I help her?

Background -
We used to work together but have gone on to work for different companies. I have seen bruises and various cuts on her face, she said the abuse started with a ""playful"" dead arm or dead leg when arguing, then gradually got worse to a slap and then punches and kicks and even household items being used. 

This lady has 3 young children, one of the main reasons why she wont tell the police is the fear of her children being taken away from her.

I want to help, I don't know how to help.

I [20F] am confused if my ex-boyfriend [20M] assaulted me or not,"My ex-boyfriend is a very sweet person and I never thought he could harm someone, however something happened on Valentine’s Day that I keep thinking about. I don’t want to go into detail but he did grab my arm and pinned me down during sex. I was squeamish and uncomfortable but I did not communicate my discomfort. The next day I developed a bruise on the arm be put the most force on and it darkened and became more painful after a few days. This is the [bruise](https://imgur.com/a/tQcarnF).

The thing is, because this was during sex and I consented to the sex, does this invalidate it as assault? I did not consent to be being pinned down though and it’s my fault for not letting him know in the moment.

After his insults, and abuse, physical, violence, there's a fucked up voice in my head... ""He doesn't love you."" and instead of ""So what?"" I get ""Oh, he loves her."" and I can't rationalize enough... He sucks. He won't ever love me because I knew what a monster he is right from beginning. It was first or second week we knew each other, and I told him ""You look like someone who could beat a woman one day."" 

He beat me. More frequently with each kid we got.
For what?
Not being perfect woman of his dream?
Not being a mom enough (his words)?
Not being chirly new blue eyed flirty woman he met?

I only feel shame that I wasn't determined to let him go when he beat me first time in front of our kids, but instead now when he loves other woman. For she doesn't know what a monster he is.",domesticviolence
Abusive boyfriend arrested. Feeling a lot of emotions,"I feel a mix of emotions. It's been years of torment as we lived together and he has said he couldn't afford to move out (has had issues holding down a steady job throughout the years). I've kicked him out 2x before  but he ended up coming back. He never hit me but has been verbally and emotionally abusive over the years-telling me things like 'don't get me angry or I'll blow up' over the smallest things, and calling me every name in the book. He's destroyed many of my household items or he's threatened to if I don't do something he's asked right that minute. I already have issues with anxiety and he just raises it through the roof at times. I jump at loud noises because I now equate it with him blowing up and getting ready to damage something of mine. For a while I had issues with I think it's called dissociative disorder. I would look in the mirror or look at my hands and not feel like they were mine. He's even told me I should commit suicide and told me a way to do it (I am not suicidal and would never do that).

 I finally went on a domestic abuse website for help and spent 2hrs on a chat. The person sent me resources I could look over and and they helped me devise a plan to start the motions of getting him out of my apartment. Unfortunately, not even 1/2 hr later I had to text 911 for help as he threatened me, pulled a knife from the kitchen and started stabbing the couch, and then told me to keep quiet. 

He's been arrested and held. I feel relief, sadness, shock, and guilt. He definitely has some mental issues that he refused to get help with (refused to see any doctors, wouldn't go for annual check up, wouldn't even sign up for health insurance) I'm afraid of the whole process going forward and what will come next (which is why it took me so long to call, and why his sister likely never called). I'm sad that it had to come to this and wish we could've just peacefully separated. He's said off and on throughout our relationship that he wanted to leave, and then would eventually just terrorize me.

 I feel guilt because he doesn't have the means to rent and I'm not sure where he will end up. I know this is his fault and that it's not something I should worry about, but it's something the weighs on me now.

I also feel relief because I finally told my parents what's been going on. They don't live in the area but they offered to drive up to make sure I was ok (we had plans set for mid-june and that was when I was hoping to work on his moving out process).",domesticviolence
How to calm the anger?,"Hi there. I (F32) left a 9 year long abusive relationship about 2 years ago. I have since moved on and got with an amazing man who has not even a shred of abusive tendencies in him. I love him more than I thought was possible - it's made me realise I don't think I ever loved my ex, only co-dependency feelings.   
I had not liked or really even tolerated my ex partner for a very long time, but I'd given up hope and so stayed, as we have a kid together.   
Eventually I saw behaviours in our child that I did not like (clearly mirroring his dad), and so I found the strength to get rid for good. I still have to have some contact with my ex, for obvious reasons. He has much more control over my life at this point, than I expected. I have so much regret that I even met him.  


Anyway, my issue is anger. I feel so angry with him all the time. Absolutely furious. Every day, all day, I have his voice in my head insulting me, criticising me and picking arguments. I then end up arguing back or defending myself. When I say voice I don't mean as in psychosis that I think it is real - it's just my thoughts, like day dreaming. This person has caused me so so so much damage, both emotionally and practically. I don't want him to continue causing me this much pain and anger on a daily basis, but my brain seems stuck in 4F mode.   


How on earth do I calm this anger?   
I have some grounding exercises to do, but it is often when I am doing housework or cooking, and so it's difficult to do the grounding stuff at that time. I end up in tears all the time. I have had severe depression for a very long time now, mostly due to certain things he controls in my life. I've tried to use music for distraction when I have to do these things, but it's not really doing much. I try to stay distracted at all times, as I feel I fall apart if I stop.",domesticviolence
Brother has abused me my entire life and now is breaking RO with fake instagram accounts,[removed],domesticviolence
Domestic violence by ex-roommate/best friend,"I’m feeling very alone, as most people experience this from romantic relationships. I don’t have a lot of energy to share the whole story, but the short version is that I moved out, and cut him out of my life after he hurt me (twisted my arm), threw things at me, called me misogynistic slurs, and excuses his behaviour by claiming that I “acted like a child and made him mad on purpose.”

I do have an SO, who is loving and kind. I have been with my partner for seven years.

I was close friends with this abusive person for seven years. He was not violent until we became roommates. And he wasn’t as violent as I know other abusers are. I am having weird dreams, and strong emotions about losing my friend, anger at injustice, and bewilderment. Why would he hurt me? It doesn’t make sense.

I have a counsellor, and my partner is understanding. I’m looking for community voices to help me... feels less alone / more understood, or to help me make sense of the confusing aftermath... in spite of this abusive person not being a romantic attachment.",domesticviolence
VERY LONG POST. Is this abuse?,"I've been with my man for 15 years.
Within the first few months, he had slapped me very hard a few times, the first being after I said Usher was sexy. He told me not to disrespect him like that. 
At 6 months together we moved in together, and things changed a lot. I had moved 4 hours away from my family of be with him since he moved for work. I was attending college but eventually stopped. We didn't have internet so I stayed at home pretty much all day. I would clean and do my make-up and wait for him to be home. 
When he was home, he would basically ignore me, or insist that I perform oral sex on him, which I didn't mind, but if I said I didn't want to, he would berate me, sometimes hurt me, definitely forced it a bunch of times. 
I will say that I have a kink which is being forced, but a lot of the time, I wasn't into it and asked him to stop. He didn't. And if I cried he enjoyed it even more.
If he was annoyed by my fighting sometimes he would stop and throw me to the floor, calling me useless. (This has never stopped btw, 15 years in and he still does it). 
One night he came home from being at a bar with his sister (I was 18 and couldn't go). He was in a bad mood, I could tell. I tried to be nice but because he was so drunk, he wanted to have sex. He was having... difficulties...and said it was because I was overweight. I told him he could hurt me, (I'm a masochist and he's a sadist) and that helped, but he took it too far. He raped me and beat me for 4 hours. I know because I kept focusing on the digital clock on the bedside table. Bright red numbers counting the minutes of my terror.
A month after that I left, but 4 months of being with a worse guy and basically being homeless, I begged him to come save me. He showed up, got me off the drugs I was addicted to, and held me through my withdrawals. I suffered a miscarriage also, I didn't even know I was pregnant. He was so caring and sweet, and had done a lot of maturing while we were broken up.
We get an apartment together and it's like a fairytale. We don't fight, don't argue, we were madly in love again. We lived there for a year and it was great. Then he lost his career, we moved to a different apartment, and he started drinking heavily. We had a friend living with us and he drank with him all day and night..I'm talking they finished off entire handles each, and he started being controlling again. I had to keep the house clean and cook every meal for him and our roommate. He would punch my leg and keep digging his thumb into the bruise if I didn't do what I was supposed to do. He hated when I hung out with friends, and constantly accused me of cheating. At the time, Myspace was still a thing and he had numerous girls on there who he would go spend time with...I have since found out he was cheating.
After I finally kicked out roommate out for bringing over people who would steal from us, he sobered up and his behavior stopped being so bad. He would romance me and things got better. 
We got another place since we were kicked out of that place (long story) and though he was still very controlling thing calmed down again. 
Now I want to say that I love this man with everything I have. He doesn't react with rage, he doesn't beat me into a corner, he doesn't do what I consider to be abuse. Not since that first year together. But, in the 15 years we've been together, he goes through stages of being aggressive towards me. He insults me, forces sex or sexual acts, and then it stops. For months at a time sometimes. It's gotten to the point where I don't know how to feel normal. It's almost like I want him to be like that because it feels like our normal...? Does that make sense?? Not to mention that it has severely affected my sexual pleasure, I can't seem to enjoy myself if he isn't being aggressive or at least demeaning me in some way. It's something he's always done, and I don't know how to ""get off"" without it.
Flash forward to 2011, we moved again, again away from my family and friends, and again I try to go to school, and he gets a good job. But as before, I stop going to school and stay home all day. I clean, I cook, etc. We would rarely go out to town or anything, we were always home. He started to be a little more aggressive more often. Randomly. I didn't know what would set it off. One time I had a black eye, a very mild one, but it was there. He took me out to eat and go shopping, after making me do my makeup so it wasn't visible. While out he asked me how it felt to know people had no idea that he hurt me like that since we look so happy. I didn't know what to say but he put my hand on his crotch and he was as hard as a rock. 
Later he held me down and forced himself on me while slapping me harder than before on the same side where the bruise was. 
We lived out there for almost 10 years. This behavior became more frequent and more intense. My entire life became centered around him and what he liked or didn't like. My appearance, my housekeeping, everything. But again it wasn't like what I believed abuse to be. I've seen in movies or heard about it from people and it just seemed more dramatic and violent than what he would do. What he did was always cool and calm, he did it with such ease and confidence, I kept telling myself it was a game, he did it to turn himself on, because he's a sadist. We played around with bondage, role played, all the normal BDSM stuff so I just thought it was part of it. 
He'd do it for a while, constantly, then as before, he would just stop. And again I felt myself needing it. I'd need him to hit me, or be mean to me. I found myself feeling anxious or uneasy if he wasn't being dominant and mean. So I would ask. And if I brought up that I felt he went too far and said maybe this was abuse and not good, he would laugh and say I asked for it....which I did. 
So it was something I wanted...
Here I am, almost 16 years together with him and now it's scary. Again his drinking got bad and he has been doing it more. But it's different now. Now I tell him I don't want it. I cry. I fight. I break down and he just keeps doing it. He says he doesn't care that I don't want it. I tell him I'm afraid of him and he smiles and says good. He'll get drunk and throw me to the ground if I say something he considered too sassy or bitchy. He doesn't always hit me, but he holds me down and says awful things to me. He makes me cry. He reminds me I have nowhere to go. That if I leave I would just go running back to him because I can't do anything right, (I have some issues so he's not wrong) and that no other man would ever be able to deal with my baggage and no one would want an overweight woman in her 30s. The sad thing is he's right. He uses me past against me when he wants to make me cry. 
And every time he does this he gets hard. He can't help but touch himself as he's either hurting me or demeaning me and insulting me. He loves doing it. 
I love him. I know I do because we've been through so much and we really are like best friends. We understand each other so well, we have been so close since the day we met. And I have my own problems. I take responsibility for him getting a taste for hurting me, because I was curious about BDSM and that stuff when we were first dating, but I never imagined he was actually abusive. Or is this abuse? I don't have bruises all over my body, I don't cower in a corner, although I have before, he doesn't beat me senseless... it just doesn't feel like the abuse we all know about from ads and movies, etc. 
I don't fear for my life because he doesn't lash out like that, he hasn't escalated like I assume he should have by now,... IDK what to call this. 


Honestly I'm not sure why I'm sharing this because I have no intention of leaving him, he's my world. I am happy with him. My day to day life is good, we laugh all the time. If you saw us together you'd never know that sometimes he gets rough with me or says mean things. He is normal 80% of the time. 

Idk. Is this abuse?",domesticviolence
It's my fault I poked the bear,"My bf and I just moved into a 1 bedroom together 
We use to live with friends in a house then spent time at his moms. My bf and I have been together for 2 years. He has gotten physically violent by moving me or shoving me out of the way before we were in the one bedroom but never anything that crazy ridiculous. I take his stuff like his mouse or his charger and hide it when he would ignore me or stonewall me after a fight. He says I took him for granted so that's why he had to get away from me or zone out. We got a one bedroom so he could have his own space because he doesnt trust me to respect his space. It's TRUE I guess. When I wanna talk with him or discuss a fight, he just stonewalls for like a day or a week or a month. It's gotten better now he just disappears to his moms for a whole 24 hours... at one point he took my phone during a fight so I took his stuff and told him give it back or I'm gonna throw it and I did and I felt awful I havent hurt any of his thing since because I really never wanted to hurt anything of his but he had pushed me around and shoved me to the ground and said horrible things to me then took my phone and it was bad. About a 2 month ago hes got into it with his brother and his brothers friend at a a party at his moms and after he pinned his brother to the wall his brother followed him and they went back to our place so his sister gave me a ride. He texted me sorry. During the fight he got mean towards me because I was telling him to calm down. All he did was text me sorry. And when I got back the next evening I tried to talk about it with him and he was like ""why do I owe you anything"" and we got into a fight and again I wouldnt give him his space and I poked the bear as I always do and he throw me down and he covered my mouth and my nose so I couldnt breath... he also laid down on my head so my head was stuck between him and the floor btw my bf is a big guy like 250lb 6 feet tall huge linebacker. I am 5 feet tall 124lb Now here i am a few months later. I hid his keys so he couldn't leave I followed him every time he did try to leave and after all that when I wouldn't give him space in his room he shoved me he held me down hes hit me ""not that hard"" he said. Hes dragged me around by my hair or my feet he held me down and grabbed my breasts just to be disrespectful and he broke all of my art on my walls because I moved stuff around in his room to get his attention. Hes pressed my head into the ground and called me awful names and held my jaw closed so I couldnt scream. Covered my face multiple times. He kept hold me down and I always struggled and it hurt my arm and my back he stretched my leg and covered my mouth so I could cry while he pushed it upwards he grabbed me by my neck and pinned in weird backwards position .My shoulders hurt my body hurts my face hurts, not bad but it hurts. Hes left barely any Mark's but there are Mark's on my face and my neck. He kept hurting my eye while trying to cover my mouth. I called the police they showed I covered for him because none of this wouldve happened if I didnt poke the bear. I pushed his button I did whatever I knew I could to push his buttons. Idk why...idk why I do these things to trigger him I just want his attention I want him to care...idk oh I gave him his keys he left but all his stuff is here.",domesticviolence
"Just need to get this off my chest really, could use some advice.. My boyfriend dragged me by my hair, put his hand over my face and held me down then broke his way through a door.","We’re both working from home at the minute because of lockdown and have been getting on each other’s nerves more than usual.

But the last time we had an argument, it wasn’t even over anything important, he grabbed me and pulled me to the floor by my hair twice, covered my mouth and nose so I couldn’t breath, I bit my lip somewhere in all this so hard it was bleeding, and then he broke through the door to a locked room when I was trying to leave the situation.

I know this isn’t good and I need to leave, I haven’t been able to sleep since this has happened because all I can think about is what do I do? I feel like I have nowhere to go. We’ve been together about 4 years and we live in a house his family owns, which he doesn’t let me forget, he says it’s his house, when we argue he screams at me to leave when he knows I’ve got nowhere to go. I pay my share of the bills and do all housework because he refuses, I buy pretty much everything for the house. There are multiple holes in the walls where he has punched them in the past, I keep trying to patch them up.

When he’s finished arguing he will go back to saying how much he loves me and how he didn’t mean anything he said. 

Just after the above happened he said if he found out I told anyone what happened he would kill me. When we weren’t arguing he said he hopes I never tell anyone because in his words ‘there’d be lynch mobs going after him’ this came up after someone on Facebook invited him to like a page that was showing support for a girl who’s boyfriend had killed her .. he didn’t like that, he tried to justify what he does and says how he isn’t abusive. He was just trying to stop me screaming, or i shouldn’t have done something. 

I’ve been thinking about leaving and how I would do it but I feel like I can’t leave and rent somewhere because I have pets that’s I don’t want to leave behind, I’d have to wait until I can get enough money together anyway. should I tell someone I trust what’s happened in case it gets worse while I find somewhere else to live? What about when I do find somewhere to live, how do I tell him? Is this something I can report or have I left it too long, it’s been just over a week? I haven’t slept properly since this happened because I’m just worrying constantly. I feel like the whole situation is so much worse because we can’t really go anywhere at the minute and it’s so overwhelming.",domesticviolence
I would like some help or insight... I feel lost,"I apologize for the long read. I haven't told anyone this but I suspect I was/am in an abusive relationship. Everything was fine the first three months but I spent a lot of time with him due to me recently having a sexual trauma and his bed was the only place I felt safe. He always told me it was fine and he was happy with me being there all the time, but there were small red flags. Blaming me for ""having sex"" before him (he was a virgin and before we were official, I had told him I wasn't even though now I don't see it as me having had sex before since it was coerced). He would punch the wall and get unnecessarily angry. He's had a rough childhood (experiencing neglect and I suspect he may have witnessed abuse too) so I just thought he was justified. I stopped hanging out with my friends and going out because he would make me feel bad and ignore my calls if I went out or give me the silent treatment when I came back after a night out, and he would shame me into wearing less revealing clothes. Some of the stuff that happened early on I can't remember because I think I tend to repress the arguments and verbal abuse because they happened often. Anyways, as we got closer and our relationship got older, he stopped liking me being around all the time and said he needed space. I should have complied, but it really hurt me to see a 180 from wanting me there 24/7 to not much at all. One night he went out with his friends without me and some girl kissed him (thats the story...idk what really happened and his friends are totally fine with cheating as he made me aware). After that I had trouble trusting him, but he had exhibited trust issues even before I did because within the first day of us dating he fought with me because I wouldn't let him go through my phone. I (and I know this is not ok behavior I'm not saying it is) started going through his phone after that because I felt a loss of security in our relationship and he was no longer really paying me compliments, being affectionate, expressing interest in sex, etc. I became depressed (I also suspect I have BPD and strong abandonment issues) and I told him, but he was not really supportive of me getting help or recognizing my trauma. He always thought I had no reason to be sad as I was financially comfortable and came from what appears on the outside to be a semi-normal family whereas he has struggled. We started to argue as he no longer tried to make an effort in our relationship and stopped seeming to care about me which really upset me. I really can't remember the first time he got physical with me as we used to ""play fight"" but sometimes he was a little more aggressive than I could handle (I'm a pretty small girl for reference like 100-110 pounds) but would apologize immediately after if I was hurt. Then one time he got angry in my car about something and slapped or punched me (again I think I blocked it out because all I remember was holding my face after and being hurt but with no real visible injury). After that, when he would get aggressive with me or really verbally mean I would slap him on the back almost as hard as I could (which again I feel ashamed of). Our fights became really frequent (sometimes 2-4 a week) where he would tell me to shut up or insult me and I would cry my eyes out so much that he would put a pillow over my head or cover my mouth so his roommate didn't hear me. The most escalated incident happened 2 months ago where he came home from going out with his friends and I was upset that he didn't check in on me and cuddle with me like he promised he would when he got back and I kept calling and texting him while he was in his roommates room because I was feeling anxious and depressed so I walked over to the roommates room and he (what I feel) humiliated me telling me to go away. I then went back to his room and attempted to cut myself for the first time and when I revealed to him that I did it, he told me I was psychotic and had no reason to do so, then when I cried he covered my mouth and neck with his hands, called me a dumbass, then told me he was going to sleep and didn't want to deal with my craziness. I was upset and so I shined my flashlight on him from beside the bed and he picked me up and threw me across the bed so hard it left a bruise because I hit a doorframe where my eyebrow bone is. He did not apologize or offer help after this and when I asked him for ice he screamed at me no. I kept crying until he got me ice and then when I realized it was wrong and wanted to document what happened and seek help, he took my phone, deleted the pictures, then held my phone overnight under his pillow and would not let me have it. I never sought medical attention for that and now I have headaches every day, and even though he took me on a date and told me it was an accident the next day, I still don't forgive him. I know I've engaged in some not healthy behavior probably some from my BPD such as tracking his location, going through his phone, and asking him to hang out with me instead of his friends (ones that told him it was ok to cheat on me). Do you think we're both at fault for this? He's all I have and I'm too ashamed to tell anyone what happened because they would just tell me to leave. I'm so attached to him though and even though we've broken up multiple times and gotten back together, I can't physically get myself to leave without wanting to die. What is wrong with me. If you asked me a few years ago if I thought this would ever be my life, I'd say hell no. I guess some of this is just daddy issues. Any comfort or opinions would be appreciated. Sorry again.

I also feel confused because he goes back and forth saying he doesn't love me anymore and doesn't want to be with me, to basically saying that didn't happen or he only says ""xyz"" because he's angry? I feel like I've been gaslit a lot as he's called me crazy at least 5 times and a cry baby almost every day. I know some of my behaviors were wrong, and I'm currently in therapy trying to work through my abandonment issues. But anything I ask him to do to help me he just ""can't"". Even something as simple as texting me once a day just to say hi or that he loves me. He's a terrible communicator. I hate him and I love him and I hate that I love him and that the person who makes me feel safe also makes me feel unsafe.",domesticviolence
What is wrong with me??,"My baby boy was born at 28 weeks and 1 day and weighed 1 pound and 8 ounces. He spent 89 days in the NICU where he was air lifted soon as he was born. They wanted to air lift me before I delivered so he would have been born with all the NICU staff and doctor's there but I delivered WAY to fast. He made it after a long LONG hard battle in the NICU with breathing and lung complications and heart problems he has to have surgery soon to repair a hole in his heart. He also has a umbilical hernia but that's not super important yet.  They released him 13 days ago to go home and I was completely shocked because we were told it would be June before they considered it..but at 9:00am I got a call from his nurse saying the neonatologist decided to release him with a heart monitor. 

LONG STORY SHORT I was so excited to get my baby boy home so no more traveling three hours to the hospital to see him. I went and got my boy and bring him home And my three older kids were so happy to see their brother and meet him because they haven't got to get because of the coronavirus. 

Well that night my husband got home from work and I thought he would be excited about our baby being home but NO he seemed ill and as the night went on he got so upset and I had no clue why but he started yelling at me because I had not cooked supper instead I picked up take out because I was traveling to get our son and didn't have time. He got louder and louder and he grabbed me and hit me in my left jaw and then when I failed he kicked me 3 times in my belly and the just walked off got in his truck and left. I called the police and made a report and went to hospital for evidence and safety. They caught him later that night driving drunk. 

I AM DOING EVERYTHING I CAN TO SUPPORT MY THREE CHILDREN. OLDER TWO ARE TWO YEARS OLD AND FOUR YEARS. I GOT ALL BILLS PAID BUT I HAD NO MONEY LEFT AFTER AND MY BABY NEEDS FORMULA BADLY HE HAS ENOUGH FOR ONE BOTTLE. SO THAT'S AN EMERGENCY HE IS ON ENFAMIL NUTRAMIGEN DUE TO DAIRY INTOLERANCE AND STOMACH ISSUES...AND I NEED A FEW GROCERIES FOR MY OTHER TWO BABIES WE ARE ON BARE MINIMUM BUT IM DOING EVERYTHING I CAN TO GET BY BUT IM STUCK AT LOSE..I AM CRYING SO HARD RIGHT NOW AND DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO.

The best revenge is to survive.,"It's been one whole week since he broke into my house.. I was sound asleep when I woke up to see him standing over me. He hit me with a glass bottle and strangled me. I was in and out of consciousness . I screamed loud enough for the neighbours to call the cops..He was arrested this time. The physical violence before was minor. I ignored it 

I thought I'd never hear from him again. I was wrong he's been calling me sending me texts about how I betrayed him but he still cares for me . I can't press charges against him and ruin his life. He's mentally unstable I can never blame someone for being sick. 


I accept I can't be with this man and I don't want to see him again but I love him dearly still. I don't think that will ever change. I'm looking at obtaining an injunction. I just find it hard to believe he's willing to risk losing his job and his standard of living... Just to harass and  hurt me. I pray for him daily I really hope he can change and be happy one day.",domesticviolence

I need advice on what to do. Please.,"Hey, I've never taken to an online forum before so please, just bear with me. I'm 16 btw with siblings 8 and 10 years old, my parents are in their late forties.

My mom and dad have been together for over twenty years. Every one of those twenty years, my mom has paid the price for seeing good in a damaged person.

My dad came from a broken family and a background of poverty. His dad died when he was a kid, and his mom remarried. Her husband left them after a few years and my dad had to support his mom and two stepbrothers by himself. Left home when he was 15 to work for them. Even after he came to Australia, he'd been sending money home, usually in thousands. This resulted in many arguments, yelling matches and physical abuse. My mom had been tolerating this because she had nowhere to go, no family in the country we live in. This happened up until last year when he promised to never lay a hand on her, and his mom died, so we thought it was over. 

It wasn't. I became the victim of his physical abuse, and mum was now being tortured emotionally. She defended me against him, and he kicked her out of her bedroom and she now has to sleep on a double bed with my other two siblings. Just last week, we went to get help, but mom doesn't want to separate. Mom's holding out, hoping we could get him to change. She reckons he's not a bad person, just doesn't have any control. She's waiting for an apology and an invite back to her own bedroom. It's been four weeks. I think dad wants an apology for her defending me.

I don't know how much more of this I can take. My sisters are innocent and their childhood is being ripped out from under their feet while I can only watch. My mom blames us three for her predicament.  She takes her bitterness out on us. She doesn't know the pain she's causing them from her statements and I'm completely torn. I already have anxiety from my own childhood and I don't want it to happen to them. I'm a good student and I can't concentrate on my schoolwork, and the worst part is that I don't think she's gonna give up on dad. I want out but I can't because mom will expect me to stay, whether she separates with dad or not. It hurts me to see my siblings like this and every time I try to defend or protect them, she ignores me. My family life is destroying me. Seeing my mom and siblings like this is destroying me. I want out. 

Sorry about how lengthy this is, I kinda went on a tangent here. I need advice on what to do. This whole thing is really complicated and it's driving me around the bend. Please.",domesticviolence
Ignored by Social Justice Warrior “Friends”,"I was assaulted and strangled by my husband on March 31st. This was the first time he’d ever hit me, although he was probably emotionally and verbally abusive. A difference I see between my situation and many others is he immediately wanted to get divorced and for me and my daughter to move away, which now makes sense because he wanted to control the narrative and how many people found out about it. He told me he didn’t love me and didn’t want me, so on top of the assault I felt complete rejection. I’m glad on some level, because I didn’t have the option to stay and put up with more abuse, but it still hurts and makes me feel alone as a survivor. 
We lived in a town of 1000 people, I was a hairstylist for many of the people there and very active in the community. We were both from a different city where we knew even more mutual people. We have about 130 mutual friends on Facebook and many more in the small town. After I was able to get what I needed from him in our separation agreement and move to my mother’s, I posted a carefully written statement about my experience on social media. I also personally told many people in our community of friends, and my many clients who wanted to know where I was and when they could get a haircut. I had a huge response, people writing support and telling their own stories. It was really incredible. But the dust has settled and there are many people who never said a word, or acknowledged what happened. They continue to support him, or they say nothing at all. 
Our group of friends is one I would have considered violence-intolerant. They post about me too and believing women, they are liberal and outspoken. But when I went public a lot of them stayed silent. Now they’re posting about police brutality, specifically George Floyd. I watched the video of what happened to him and was triggered into a panic attack, remembering what it was like to not be able to breathe. I’m just as angry about what is happening to black people in America, and I never want to compare my experience, but isn’t it comparable? Isn’t women being abused by men as prevalent as people of color being abused by law enforcement? And I mean this on a very personal level, not just a global one. Why are these people posting constantly about the injustice of what happened to George Floyd, and staying silent about what happened to me? 
I’m so angry and I don’t have anywhere to put it. I posted two things to my IG story yesterday pretty much saying what I’ve said here, but regretted it and took them down. I need support in this and my poor friends are so fatigued, I feel horrible for them. They empathize but can’t relate to what it’s like to be beaten and strangled, kicked out of your home with your child in a pandemic, and to speak out about it and be ignored. I know I’m focusing on the people ignoring me rather than the supportive ones, but it’s like a knife in my heart. This liberal “woke” group of people will speak up for someone they don’t know, but when their voice will actually have an impact they’re silent. And he’ll get away with this and never be held accountable by anyone and I’m sitting here with this horrible pain. 
I don’t know what I need from this group but I’m glad to at least have a place to share this sadness and frustration.",domesticviolence
Court is Monday and I'm scared,"I have a protection order on spouse (threatened suicide with a gun, damaged property, screaming, yelling, and wanted me to come outside and search for him) (he ask killed our dog a year ago he revealed to me recently) I was able to escape with kids after calling police.

When I left he tried calling me multiple times, left a few messages pleading to see me and the kids. He got his father to call me and leave me a message (he sounded sad and upset) asking me to come over to talk.

Spouse showed up at my work trying to get in and wanting to see me. He left because I wasn't there. When he was served with VPO he took his guns and left the house.

He returned within 24 hours to get all of his stuff (no proof it was him)

He hasn't tried to contact or bother us. I found out he lost his job a few days after his episode. Attorney is also working on filing for divorce.

I have court Monday and I'm so afraid. I'm going to have an advocate and ask to see if we can have a police escort.

Besides that, does anyone have any advice or encouragement? I literally have no family or friends I can place these burdens upon. I don't know what's going to happen and I just want to be safe.",domesticviolence
Best friend just told me her boyfriend hits her. She lives with him in a different city. What to do?,"(We are both in our early 20s)

She moved to the city her boyfriend lives in a few months ago and lives with him, his mother and sister. 

She told me today, and doesn’t want to let her family know because she knows they’ll call the police and she doesn’t want that. (her family and all her friends, including me live in the capital city)

She works but currently doesn’t have enough to pay a deposit, 1 month rent AND rent on top of that. She was planning on leaving months ago but didn’t expect this to happen this soon. 

She doesn’t want to come back to the capital city because she loves her current job but it worries me knowing that she’s in a city where the only person she knows well is her abuser. 

I don’t think she would want to go to a women’s shelter. What should I do? I’m SO worried about her right now, I also want her to visit a doctor since she was complaining about pain.

How do I get myself to stop caring for my abuser?,"I just recently ended my relationship with someone who was very very abusive to me a few days ago. It got to the point where he slammed me to the ground, the wall, and on the bed. He's choked me, pressed on my eyes, kicked and punched me. I know this all sounds ridiculous and anyone in their right mind would immediately know to switch gears and not care for this person. I don't know why I find myself still caring for this person. We had so much history together and he's tried to seek therapy himself but still repeats these behaviors. There were times where he was able to remain calm and asked that he leave so he could be in a better headspace to return and have civil conversations, but all that seem to go out the window when he snaps. 

 I don't like that I still care and miss him. I've blocked all contacts because I know that's what needs to happen because it got out of hand and he still tries to call me from an unknown number. Im afraid I might cave in one day and pick up. I know I shouldn't. Also, this is very embrassing to admit, but I can't help but desire our sexual chemistry again. I know that's not a healthy love, but i don't know how to wrap my head around why I feel the way I do. With this whole covid 19 shelter in place, it's been hard to get a support group going. I've already called the national domestic abuse hotline and they've linked me to my local group, but even they've haltered meetings and so I'm looking for any support I can get so that I don't go back into making the same mistakes again, thank you for taking the time to read this.",domesticviolence

How to assist a victim?,"betterfindurheart1907:34 PM
Yo shut the fuck up you troll! If you are really in trouble find a damn shelter. Don’t blame strangers for your mistakes. At least protect your son! If you’re with your abuser then that is your fault no one else’s! Walk to the damn gas station and get gas. You dumb bitch!""

ANOTHER PERFECT RESPONSE

""You know what lady, short of someone giving you cash, there is nothing to help your immediate situation. I’m guessing you conveniently ran out of gas far from resources.
Probably time to start waking to the nearest gas station with your kid and dog, and ask there if someone can help you. Sitting on your device arguing with people is a waste of time. Considering you have no gas, wonder what will happen when you have no access to internet? Batteries don’t last forever""

I'm posting those since the mods aren't doing shit. Trying to defend myself and everything gets locked. Rules only apply to certain people. Y'all do me a favor when the next mother/kid is killed by the abuser don't ask or say ""why didn't she just leave"". The abuser has already alienated the victim from friends and family and made sure there is no resources available to leave. There are cities being burned to the ground humanity is nonexistent and nobody is equal.",domesticviolence
"Caught girlfriend cheating in chat, she pulled a gun","I was dating my now 43 year old ex-girlfriend for 5+ years. We've had serious issues here and there, I've been thrown out and left a bunch of times. She's cheated on me on Tinder 6+ times. She was always trashing me to her friends on social media. One of her friends egged her on to keep cheating on me. She almost left me for someone else once. Her adult son went crazy one morning, and threatened me with a knife, and stabbed our kitchen table.

Our issues stemmed from a bunch of different sources: her son (20) was a drug addict and a drug dealer who didn't clean up after himself. Her oldest daughter (23) was a drug addict that was also a cutter and was bulimic. Her younger daughter(18) was also a drug addict and later became a drug dealer. She had one son who was a good student in school who had no real issues. (19).

She was former Army going through a divorce with a somewhat indifferent husband who had moved on with a younger woman. I had been divorced 2 years, and was living alone, when she was involuntarily separated from the Army for high year tenure, and was about to lose her housing.

We had known each other in high school, but not well. We hung out a few times. In fact, I asked her to marry me when I was 18 and she was 16, but she said ""no"".

We began talking on Facebook Messenger, and she would go into another room and talk to me, for hours and hours. We got along great. Eventually she surprised me and came down to see me, December 26, 2014, and stayed for a while, until things got crazy back home. She bought me a car, as I had lost mine in some wrangling with my ex-wife during my divorce, an old.Buick, but hey, it was a car, and I loved her for helping me.

She left again in February,  but we reunited on Valentine's day for a Hozier concert in Seattle, which she arranged and paid for. She had gotten severance pay from the Army. She lived off this for a good while, and didn't work for around 3 months or more. 

It was a good time, and I loved her, but even then, I knew I couldn't please her. She had a huge sex drive, and I had suffered a bit from erectile dysfunction. I had some pills, but they were old, but I had underlying problems with my blood pressure and blood sugar that were causing problems.

Eventually, she moved back in with me, and we had a great life, just laughing and talking and spending time together. Her oldest daughter was living on her own in D.C., her youngest daughter and oldest son was living with her dad in San Antonio, and her younger son, the food student, came to live with us, and she brought her 3 dogs, 2 golden retrievers and a small terrier mix.

Eventually, things got bad at the exhusbands place, so the you get daughter and oldest son came to live with us in a small, 700ft 1 bedroom apartment. 

Eventually, we had to move. The daughter kept skipping school and getting the property management to let her in where they could see the 3 large dogs, so we were asked to leave, also based on occupancy. We had 5 people in there.

When we moved to the new neighborhood, my girlfriend asked her oldest daughter if she wanted to live with us, and she brought her Russian live-in boyfriend, and broke up with him on the same day, but he continued to live with us for a year. My girlfriend at this time was a nurse, so she make good money. I wasn't making very much, and I felt like such a mooch. I had paid all the bills at our old apartment, as I had when I lived alone, but I had little left over after child support was taken out. I helped where I could, I always did the dishes, the laundry, cleaning the whole house, vacuuming...I tried to make her life easier in ways that I could, since I couldn't help in financial ways. I loved her deeply, but I always felt a bit outnumbered and outvoted, and had no real say in anything.

A year or so later, I lost my job, and was unemployed for a year. I took great care of the house, but she despised my not working. She was paying for everything related to the house, and I was taking care of it, but I really wasn't that big of a burden, I was cleaning up after 4 kids that weren't mine, and one live in boyfriend, occasionally taking them to school when they missed the bus, or I would drive them to work. At some point, her oldest son began bringing drug addicts and derelicts around the house, and I had words with him about it. My girlfriend hated me disciplining her kids, but she wasn't doing it, either. She let them run all over her, cursing her out, calling her names, disrespecting her...something I put a stop to. You'd think she'd appreciate that, but she felt it was causing a problem in her relationship with her kids.

She began going on Tinder and hooking up with random guys for quickies. Once, she even let one guy watch once. She began seeing a guy named Jim, leaving me alone with her kids while she went to have sex with him. She would lie and say she was going to fo look at a table for sale or go to a thrift shop.

Things got real bad for a while, when the oldest daughter threw her boyfriend out, and turned to alcohol. She would get driven home by the bartender so they could go home. She would dump hundreds of dollars out on the ground and leave her cellphone, and new iPhone, in the street.

Her oldest son had gotten thrown out of two schools, and was now on his 3rd time as a senior. He and his friends stole a wallet from a truck at a nearby construction site, which brought the police to our home. They drew guns on me, demanding I turn him over. He wasn't even home. Our house became the bad house in the neighborhood where the cops were always called.

My girlfriend helped me find another job, and let me drive her truck, while she sold her car to her son so he could go to his academy school for special students across town. She was a nurse for the same company I worked for, though in different cities. We could communicate on Skype to one another all day. It was beautiful. I still didn't make enough ro support her, but I would come home, and clean, and do car repairs, and build projects for her. Anything she asked for.

Eventually, the youngest daughter became a problem, with drugs and alcohol and skipping school, and one got her boyfriend to try and run me over with his car,...and she moved back with her father. She moved back 6 months later, with a new drug habit, and was even worse. She was climbing in and out of windows, lying about working, and staying gone days at a time. The oldest daughter had herself committed, met a friend inside, tried to convince us the friend should move in, and got a job as a waitress in a strip club.  The oldest son kept bringing trashy friends over in the middle of the night, making our house smell like pot, and sneaking his younger sister out for parties. The oldest sister gave her alcohol and she almost killed herself with alcohol poisoning, and the police came, having been called because she had been drinking on Facebook Live.

The oldest son came home high, and shit in the backyard. My girlfriend confronted him, and he started acting like he was going to hit her. I shouted from upstairs, and he came up the steps at me with a knife. My girlfriend called the police, and he was arrested. She bailed him out, which caused a fight. We worked through that, she got him his own place, the youngest daughter found some drug counselor to live with, and my girlfriend had a fight with the oldest daughter when she came home drunk again, and the oldest daughter moved out, too, leaving just the good student son, who then found a friend to move out with, leaving just the two of us again.

My girlfriend had quit her job, and went back to college to be a doctor. It was hard and stressful. The truck died, and I had built up enough credit to buy a new car. My girlfriend bought two more cars, whixh i fixed up for her, was in accidents in both, and got one more last car.

Things were okay. She had too much time on her hands, and began starting fights when I came home because she wanted to do something and I was just trying to relax. I still couldn't match her libido. 

Eventually I come home, and she tells me she has started talking to a cousin she hadn't spoken to in 10 years. I don't think much of it at first, but she's going into closed rooms to talk to him. I catch a few screens of their chats online, and they're really suggestive for cousins. I mentioned it, and she said there was nothing to worry about.

She had been repairing her credit. She wanted to buy a house. Waived in an HOA, and the rent was terrible. She got her VA home loan, and we were preparing to move. We had found this house she loved because it was on a lot of land for her plants and dogs, and it had a handicap accessible bathroom off of the master bedroom, which she said she selected for me, because I have bad knees. It wasn't one floor, like we had talked about, but it was nice. It was older, and the wiring was crazy, and there were lots of things that needed to be done. It was a good project house, and I would be kept busy.

We're in the midst of moving and packing, and she's hiding in other rooms, talking to this ""cousin"". I eventually open the door, and ask just what is going on. This was similar to the way I was talking to her when she was about to move on from her ex-husband, so my suspicion was going off. 

For the scene I started, she broke up with me, and I was told it was over, that she didn't want me to move with her, al.ost like it was planned that way. She had a meeting with her kids, and had a chat with her friend that was always pushing her to leave me, that she was either going to not buy the house and just move in with her cousin, or buy the house and all the kids could move back in because apparently I was the problem, and now I was out of the picture. 

Her kids expressed interest, especially the older waitress daughter and the drug addict son. They hadn't had particularly successful stints living on their own.

I made one last ditch effort to save the relationship, and she relented. I was back in. She made the announcement to the kids, and the oldest waitress daughter flat out said it was a mistake, according to the relationship advice she read on Tumblr. 

We moved. Some days the kids would help. Most days they didn't. I unloaded 2 Uhaul trucks by myself. I was trying to do all the things my girlfriend always wanted me to do. I took my Viagra, even though it used to make me feel bad, and we started having sex 3 to 4 times a day. We were making bold plans for this new house. Her drug addict son moved in. The waitress daughter, too. I tried to make peace. They made their plans when I wasn't going to be here.

We were doing really great, except she was still talking to this cousin an awful lot, even talking calls when we were eating together or having a conversation. 

She had made some plans to visit this cousin and the rest of her family, supposedly. She wasn't forthcoming with the date, but apparently it was a plan put in motion in the brief period we were broken up.

About two weeks before the visit, she starts to go cold. She doesn't want sex anymore, because I had satisfied that craving. She didn't want to kiss me if I was too sweaty. She was pushing me away, and talking to him more. Evey time I said something about it, she said I was being insecure. 

Last Saturday, I ask when she was leaving. She said June 3rd. She said she didn't know when she was coming back. That was how it was when she came to stay with me, too. I said something about it. I asked if she was going to unblock me on Facebook (she had blocked me when we broke up), so I could chat with her all the time when she was with him, like he was foing when she was with me, or if I was her dirty little secret.

She got up and left for an hour. Then she suggested we unpack some boxes in the bedroom together. She starts saying she never goes out, never gets to wear these pretty dresses. I don't take her anywhere nice. She leaves again for four hours this time. She comes back and tells me not to bother unpacking my things. ""There's no trust, no respect, and you hate my kids"".

I was floored. It wasn't even an argument. It was if her mind was made up by someone else. She was dead cold, and wanted nothing to do with me. I began packing my things back up again.

I try to make peace. Nothing. I try to ask her daughter what I should do, and I notice her daughter is saying the same things her mother said. I had accused her of a crime, of incest, and that was insulting. 

It gets to a point where I'm ready to leave, apparently for good. My ex-girlfriend says she was going to offer for me to stay until I found a place, if i fixed up her house with all the things i had planned to while she was gone, and maybe she would miss me, and maybe we could talk when she got back, whenever that was. Her oldest daughter was hiing to move out in a month, her oldest son was going to move in with his dad in two months, she needed someone to watch her dogs.

I agreed. At least it was a small glimmer of hope, and I had a place to stay, and didn't have to drastically alter my life. I was still heartbroken she was going to leave with our relationship in shambles.

There were little hints she still cared. She cracked jokes with me. I collect Transformers and she still went down the aisle and would tell me what they had. She had watched on our Ring cam and saw me throw away a McDonald's bag, so she knew I was eating, despite being heartbroken. 

I had made about of changes last time we broke up. I was making more now. I changed my debit pin to her birthday, like she always wanted. I made my Facebook profile pic a pic of us together. I was going to a therapist. I was looking into getting my disability pay increased. I was in line for a transfer and a promotion. I had found a program that would pay me to take care of her for her disability, that would make up in the money she was losing from college. She was using the GI Bill, but Covid was keeping her home in a virtual class, and that gave her extra time, and she spent that extra time talking to her cousin. I had told her I had some paperwork to fill out, and I had an interview the next day, and they money would be enough to cover the mortgage or my half of the combined bills. Finally, I was going to be able to contribute in a meaningful way. I had given her sex, and she still canned me. Now I was about to give her a large amount of money. 

I came home, and she was mowing the grass. She was looking very sexy, wearing this black top I always thought looked good. I told her I needed to talk to her, she said she'd come inside when she was finished. I thought for sure shed be happy, and consider taking me back. When we had talked earlier about all they ways I helped her, it almost seemed like she had gone soft again, and realised I really did love and care for her, and showed it in the best ways I could. 

I went upstairs and saw her laptop was open. I moved the mouse, it was on Facebook. I looked at the chat. There it was.

A lurid sex chat with her cousin. She was talking about it gushing like Hoover dam, and about how she couldn't wait to be with him. There were nudes exchanged. A video chat. He said she went three deep. She said it tasted great. It was perverse. It was dirty. It was very much like the sex we had the month before.

Her daughter had told me there was nobody else and I was an asshole for accusing her of a crime, something my girlfriend echoed later, letting me know the daughter had planted the seeds of the breakup. She had even said she wanted all of her mother's attention and felt she couldn't get that when we were doing well together, but here it was: she was chatting with someone else, and that someone else was her cousin, and it was incest. 

I wasn't crazy. I knew it all along. She just kept me for the move. She just kept me for the labor. Now she was going to go fuck her cousin after breaking up with me so she could justify and legitimize it and say it wasn't cheating because we weren't together. 

I called her into the kitchen and confronted her with what I saw. She immediately grew irate. She demanded I delete it from my phone. I refused. She said ""You're going to ruin me! Destroy me!""

She went into the bedroom. I took this chance to leave. When she came out of the bedroom, she had her gun in her hand. I went into the garage. She locked and loaded the gun behind me. It was a Walther PPX. There was no safety. That gun was ready to fire.

She shoved my back, forcing me into the dryer. I shoved her away, and went for the door...I went out and through the gate and felt the gun in my back. I spun around to get by her and close to my car. She stopped me, and kicked at my bad knee twice, then thrust her knees toward my knee or groin. She grabbed at the pocket for my phone. I dodged all her attacks, and was holding the gun back with one hand. She kept saying my name. I asked what she was afraid of. She shoved the barrel of the gun into my chest, I felt the barrel was right at my heart. There was anger and evil in her eyes. I heard her say my name through pursed lips and clenched teeth. I heard her finger on the trigger.

We were now at the end of the driveway. I had always told her, she or her son was one day going to kill me, and to save jail time, say it was suicide. It would be believable. I've been depressed since our breakup, and everyone knew that.

I couldn't get to my car. It was too far to go anywhere by foot to be out of range. I had accepted it: I was about to die.

Then i saw a young woman on the sidewalk across the street, and shouted out ""Please hell.me, she's going to kill me, she has a gun! Please call 911!"" and the young woman did, and reported what she saw.

The police came, and arrested my ex-girlfriend for aggravated assault with weapon, and battery, and I left alone, heartbroken, and confused.",domesticviolence

10:05 PM

I went to hangout with Chad. Just to have a good time, hang out.
Little did I know I was walking into the story of my own attempted murder.
Everything was going great. We were having a great time. For the first week anyway.
He kept trying to get me to message his ex. He thought I knew where she was at. He thought I had his phone tapped and that I was working for the feds, and was trying to set him up. I couldn't give him any answers either and that started pissing him off. My last week with him was pure hell.. torture. Literally.
It started one morning, he'd been up all night. Picked me up by my throat, started choking me. Hit me a few good times. Then while I was down started pressing his knee into my chest. Told me he'd just keep doing that until I stopped breathing. That it would look like I had a heart attack. No one would know any different.
He wouldn't let me leave at this point. Threatened my family. Took my phone. Even started messaging my friends and everyone. That night he was supposed to go see his mom at the hospital and made me go.
Going down Route 2 he continued hitting me. So I opened my door and tried to jump out but he grabbed my hair and pulled me back in. I kicked and fought but he was stronger than me. That's when he took me down by the river. Saying everything would be fine and he'd let me live if I would just tell him the truth and answer his questions.
But I didn't have his answers. So I was beat some more. He was going to kill me and throw me in the river.
Then he said that would be too easy. No, he was gonna keep me alive and torture me until I gave him answers.
So we went back to his house.
Monday, March 9, 2020 is the day he slipped. One small mistake.
He took me to St. Mary's in Huntington, WV with him so he could visit his mom. Told me to wait in the truck.
Soon as he turned the corner and was out of sight I took off. Ran to the emergency room while I had 911 on the phone telling them what was going on.
I'm safe for the time being. But I'm terrified.. if he finds me, I'm dead.

"Trigger hard after watching Epstein show, my take away","My take away from watching the mini series:

5 years on and the abuse from my ex still affects me?,"Hi guys, hope that this is the right place to post as I’ve been considering writing this for a while. I’m not sure how to start this but I’ll give a bit of background. Basically I’m a male and I met my ex in my final year of uni and I think I was swept away by the fact that she was smart, wealthy, etc etc and couldn’t believe that she actually wanted to be with me. She was great with my friends at first and when I graduated and wanted to stay in the city, I was happy to take up her offer of living with her until I found my own place and the following year we would move closer to my hometown where she would study for her masters degree. This is where it all changed...

(Sorry guys, on reread this is quite long so feel free to just skip to the last paragraph if you want to see my question)

Over the next two years she became increasingly violent and aggressive. She would dig her nails into my arm and punched me in the head on several occasions. Once, I put my arm up in self defence and it caused a bruise on her wrist which she would constantly use against me to make me feel like a bad person. My friends who she liked at first became “bad influences” and just the mention of them would flare up arguments so eventually it became easier not to see/mention them to avoid this. She changed the plan to move near to my hometown without telling me by enrolling for her masters at the same uni. Near the end of the relationship my mental health was struggling, especially following the death of my grandad and I wanted to seek counselling which she wouldn’t allow me to because I’d be a “weirdo”. I finally found the strength to leave her when she said she was going for dinner with friends and by chance I spotted her having a romantic meal with another guy.

I have too many instances of abuse and those are just some that I can pull from the top of my mind and I know that they’re not half as bad as what some have experienced on this thread. I’ve since moved back to my hometown and my friends have welcomed me back with open arms which I don’t deserve. I’ve also met the girl of my dreams who is the most intelligent person I’ve ever met, so understanding, supportive and exactly what I’ve always wanted in a partner. We own a house together and are due to be married next year.

The point I’m trying to make is that I often find myself feeling bitter towards my ex and all of those years that she has taken from me. I often think about the fact that she is free to do what she wants and that some poor guy is probably being abused by her right now and that could be down to me. I’m not sure that there’s much I can do now and I’ve tried to help friends who seem to show signs of being in controlling relationships but it never seems to scratch the itch. I also want to stop feeling like my friends secretly hate me for abandoning them. I thought that this would subside over the years but I find myself here after 5 years just as bitter as ever and wondering what I can do to move forward.",domesticviolence

Online stand up against child abuse,"Come and join us 🤗 see link below

Since the lockdown, victims of domestic violence have become even more vulnerable. Have you ever considered what abuse does to a child’s soul? What it is like to survive years of abuse, and process the trauma to become able to live a balanced adult life?
While Hungarian politicians keep humiliating women in public, Hungary has recently said no to the Istanbul Convention, which protects women and children from abuse. The real reason behind this decision is not that the country is completely prepared to help victims and prevent violent acts, nor is it the foreign policy (migration) arguments the government proposes, but their total indifference to the problem.
However, this is a problem that knows no country borders and appears everywhere. Come with us on May 31st, children’s day – let’s stand up for those who need protection the most!
The whole event will be in Hungarian and English.

"Schizophrenic brother who is abusing his wife, now has a vendetta against me(his sister)","Ever since my brother (Luis) came back from jail in December, he's been an ever looming presence, ruining the peace and joy we've had the 4 years he was gone.

He's schizophrenic but also violent and would assume my other brother Tony or my dad would be hooking up with his wife.  

One of my other brother's Tony was outside throwing some trash away at night and my brother Luis started shouting at him saying that my brother fucked his wife, even though Tony has a girlfriend. They ended up fighting and Tony had bloody cuts on him from the fight. They stopped once my dad pulled them apart.

The day after my brother ended up chocking his wife and almost killing her. He left bruises on her arm. She said she would call the cops and he ended up running away into the street.

He came back later threatening us if we called the cops and saying his wife was reading our minds. I ended up kicking him because he was getting close to me.

The police came by because someone called. I ran to them and told them my brother had abused and almost killed his wife. They talked to me and asked me what had been going on. My brother's wife denied the abuse and the bruise, but I told them that it was in fact caused by my brother. They took him away, although my brother did try fighting the police at some point.

They have 3 kids who have witnessed the violence going on, who will be telling the court what they witnessed. 

My brother is in jail for a bit before they do the court stuff but I'm really scared as he now is out to get me. 
I'm glad I told the police because my mom and my brother's wife kept denying the abuse.

I just hope he goes to jail forever. 
He's on parole and has 2 strikes already, so hopefully if he's charged with domestic abuse I don't have to fear him coming to kill me.

This has been so stressful and even though I wasn't being abused, I know how violent my brother is and how mad he was when my mom told him that the police talked to me.

I wanna know how to protect myself from him because I'm scared.",domesticviolence
My boyfriend threw a clothes horse at me,"Hello guys,

I am very confused right now. My bf (26) of two years threw a clothes horse at me (23) two weeks ago.

 I have met this guy at my university in a very depressing time of my life. I grew up with my grandparents, my parents left me alone as a child, my dad abandoning me two times for two years. My grandpa had just passed away. I started going to therapy, which I am still doing and it helped me a lot, but he also helped me and was there for me, then I needed to cry and was very caring and empathetic. In fact he helped me heel a lot.

I really fell in love with him and wanted to become the best version of my self, kind and mindfull and empathetic. I was ready to work on every issue we had, learn to communicate better, meet his needs and be there for him...

So here is the thing, he always gets very upset and angry over small things. He starts crying then he has to do something in the household, so I end up doing it. I think he is a workaholic. He works up to ten hours every single day... In our two years of relationship he took like three weeks off. He says he feels empty and depressed then he is not working. He can't fight. Every time we have an argument, he rather leaves the room or stares at his phone. Two times he had punched a wall in front of me, blaming me for it. ""I push his buttons"". Then he started throwing stuff against the wall. He won't talk to me until I apologize for the argument (It is normally just me pointing out small things, that hurt or bother me). 

This time it was about my grandmothers birthday. I wanted to visit her and for him to come along. He struggled a said, that he would rather work. I got really sad and told him that it makes me said he doesn't care and he had an outburst and threw the clothes horse at me. I raised my arm and it left a scratch. Then he went silend and I packed my things and went away.

He then wrote a really long letter apologizing and we agreed to talk again a few weeks from then, after cooling down. And I don't know what to do. If I should try to work things out, find another way to solve our problems or just leave it and suffer a bit. I know that no relationship is perfect and that everthing needs work...

So here is the thing. I kind of know he can be very kind and creative and playfull and he really helped me. I don't want to hurt him and a part of me is excusing all this I guess. Like he is very stressed, works very hard, his mom has a depression and his parents really are always fighting, even getting violent... And I really have compassion for him and don't want things to end. On the other hand... It is not only this. He is so disrespectfull with my creative work, insulted my believes... One time he wanted me to write a two page essay, explaining why my policial opinion on a topic is wrong (It wasn't just the same as his). 

He cares a lot about what people think and gets upset then I am joking around with my friends and having fun, like just dancing around with my best friend Eva. He sais that this embarases him. 

Don't know... Could it all just get worse? Am I co-depended? Don't know... A part of me believes it is all my fault, that I am being to harsh, then expressing my concerns... I can get very sad sometimes, too and just lie in bed a cry. I also get angry, then he insults me... But I never try to harm him on purpose and I am trying to grow as a person and communicate better every time... Also noting that my dad is a narcissist and he wrecked my judgedment of people and situations... I feel so brainwashed.",domesticviolence

How can I help her?

Background -
We used to work together but have gone on to work for different companies. I have seen bruises and various cuts on her face, she said the abuse started with a ""playful"" dead arm or dead leg when arguing, then gradually got worse to a slap and then punches and kicks and even household items being used. 

This lady has 3 young children, one of the main reasons why she wont tell the police is the fear of her children being taken away from her.

I want to help, I don't know how to help.
What can I do? Are there any resources I could give to her to help?

Was I sexually assaulted?,"TW: Sexual assault, rape

I don’t even know where to start. I just feel like I shouldn’t be as bothered by this as I am. I’ve been raped three times in my life, as well as sex trafficked. I feel if I call rape again, people are going to just stop believing me, I’M going to stop believing me. I feel there’s only so many times you can say you were raped before people stop believing you.

To give a little bit of backstory, I have a very turbulent relationship with my parents. Last month, I (19 female) got into a huge argument with them, and my boyfriend (23, male, let’s call him Ryan) picked me up to stay with him in his basement apartment a few cities over.

I wouldn’t say my relationship with Ryan is the greatest. He is totally uncommunicative and it’s like pulling teeth trying to get him to explain his emotions towards me. He never cleans up after himself, always makes me do household chores (his laundry, his dishes, his cleaning of his room and stuff, in addition to my own chores).

I am also in school full time online (and have been for a couple weeks now) and haven’t even opened any of my courses because I’ve been so busy. 
I also have no money coming in and have to apply for Ontario Works (social assistance).
In addition to that, my grandpa was just released from the hospital on palliative care with cancer and has very little time left, but I can’t see him because I’m sick (my doctor though it was covid but it’s actually a kidney infection that could lead to kidney failure. I’m on antibiotics right now).

Ryan and I broke up about a week ago after I (very difficultly) pulled out of him that he doesn’t enjoy spending time with me and would rather spend time alone. He sleeps till 4pm, wakes up, wants alone time from me so he goes for a walk, we have dinner while he looks at cars on his phone or watches tv, then he plays video games while I clean up after him. I fall asleep around 12pm and he stays up till 4am because he “needs a bit more alone time” (his words). 

So once Ryan and I broke up last week, he decided he wanted to go back home to his town a few cities over to see his mom and his dog. He was leaving Tuesday and said I can stay till Friday at the latest in his apartment. So I was scrambling to find an apartment quickly, get on Ontario Works, try to work on school work, send email updates to my grandpa, communicate with my therapist, and clean the apartment, all with a very painful kidney infection. 

Fast forward to last night, Ryan and I decide to have some edibles because I’m in a lot of kidney pain and very stressed out. 

To give some backstory on this, I don’t do well with weed. I suffer from something called cannabis-induced psychosis (it doesn’t happen every time though). The first time I ever had marijuana, it was shatter and I severely greened out, because I had waaaay too much. I was also sexually assaulted when I greened out. I think that, along with the fact that all of my sexual assaults have involved marijuana, just fucked up my tolerance. 

I took half a caramel edible last night. One caramel was 5 mg thc/cbd balance. I split it in half so that it was only 2.5mg. That’s not a lot at all, that’s a minuscule amount. Still, less than an hour later, I was forgetting every couple of seconds where I was, absolutely mind blown that there was a wall I could lean on behind me, felt like I could feel every molecule in the sheets I was sitting on, and amazed that I could coordinate my body to get a spoonful of ice cream from my cup to my mouth. I can’t believe how high I was on so little thc and cbd. It felt like I had the whole package. 

At some point, I remember becoming so freaked out by the fact that my body could move from sitting up to lying down. I’d be lying beside Ryan and then I’d sit up, become so freaked out, and then 3 seconds later, totally forget how I got from lying down to sitting up. I remember lying face-up on my back on the bed, leaning my head against the wall, and slowly slipping into a comatose-like state.

Ryan would poke me and tickle my feet, but I wouldn’t respond to any of it. If he tried tickling me, my brain would feel it, and my body too, but I couldn’t move to react to it. I could make small movements with my hands, but they were balled up into fists and my leg muscles felt so tight. I was squeezing all my muscles and when I would actively try to relax them, they would spasm and twitch and go back to being tight. 

I was staring at the ceiling. At some point, I remember my eyes rolling into the back of my head, and then closing my eyes and becoming aware of the fact that I was breathing, and controlling my breathing. I thought that if I stopped thinking about breathing, it wouldn’t happen naturally and I’d just suffocate. 

Ryan laid down beside me and asked if I was okay. He roughly pulled my eye open with his fingers and I couldn’t see anything. It felt like my eyes were in the back of my skull. All I could do at that point was move my mouth by smiling, even if I was freaking out in my head. My outside body and smile didn’t match the inside of my body and my mind. 

Even though I could hear everything going on and feel everything at the point, I couldn’t react to it or move or speak. I felt Ryan pushing my body around. Everything was weak. My arms felt heavy and my whole body was limp. He started grabbing me and I remember him saying “you’re just like a toy doll, I can do whatever I want to you”. I remember him taking my underwear off and fucking me. I wasn’t able to move or say anything but he was manhandling me, grabbing me hard, strangling me, and at one point he pushed me over and I forcefully hit my head against the cannot beside the bed. I still didn’t react and it didn’t hurt, but I remember feeling the pressure of the hit. 

At some point, he finished, and got up to go to the bathroom. I remember still being unable to move but freaking out in my head that I needed to call someone, anyone, to ask for help. 

When I was finally able to start moving and open my eyes, I stumbled around and slowly walked around the apartment, looking for my headphones and forgetting what I was doing every couple seconds. I couldn’t really talk or communicate, except say small sentences like “I’m going walking”. 

He gave me his pocket knife and seemed genuinely worried about me going out at 3 in the morning by myself, high. I just wanted to get away to think. 

When I called a friend, she got mad at me and told me I should’ve known I couldn’t handle weed. She said “that’s what happens when you do shit like that. Bad stuff will happen”. I felt like it was all my fault and felt guilty. So I went back home (it didn’t help that I was feeling very paranoid, like someone was following me). 

I got back home and, despite feeling like I had been gone for an hour, Ryan said I was gone maybe 10-15 minutes max. I don’t really remember the rest of the night, but I’m pretty sure we went to bed shortly after that.

The next morning, I woke up and felt so shitty about myself. I remember most of what happened, and my head was killing me from the forceful hit. When Ryan woke up, I asked him if he knew why my head was hurting so much, knowing full well he wouldn’t say anything. He couldn’t give me an answer, and said maybe it was my medications causing it. 

All day, I made casual comments about my head and my eye hurting, my arms hurting as though there were bruises developing, but nothing. He wouldn’t admit anything. It was only that night that he said with a laugh “do you remember us having sex last night?”. I said no and asked him to explain what happened, but he brushed it off and changed the subject. Fast forward a day, I wake up with swelling in my eyelid where he forced it open with his (probably dirty) fingers. Over the past couple days, the swelling has been getting worse, to the point where I can barely see out of my eye while I’m writing this.

Ryan has gone back home so I’m in the apartment by myself, with a lot of anxiety.

I thought I’d write this post basically to ask if this was wrong in any way? I know it’s a stupid question but, we were kind of still together (he’s my ex but it’s complicated. We still kiss, hug, have sex), and I just feel like there’s a reasonable explanation for why he did this. I’m pretty pissed about my eye though, especially because he won’t admit that he pried open my eye with his dirty hands day’s earlier. 

I think I’m just stunned right now that someone I trusted so much could do something like this. It makes me not want to trust anyone again :(

Any help or advice would be appreciated. Thank you in advance.",domesticviolence

Did anyone else’s abuser assault while you were asleep?,"After 1.5 years of being with my very recently ex partner I started to wake up to finding him having sex with me. He appeared to be asleep but lots of his behaviours didn’t add up and eventually I just believe what he said due to not being able to prove otherwise. 

He would have sex with me and I would wake up, get him off of me and then he would do a dramatic wake up usually because getting him off of me involved me kicking him in the shin due to him being literally over twice my size. After begging him to see a doctor and him telling me he was too scared to get into trouble I believed maybe it was just a sleep thing. It continued to the point in which I would wake up and be ontop and he would say that I instigated but I can’t recall at all and wasn’t in the mood ever when I woke up?

I actually went to see my doctor because I’ve been sexually abused a lot though life and I didn’t want to do something that made me very upset. Well even my doctor asked if I was sure I was instigating it and I believed what he told me was happening? 

Is this something others have experienced? I’m really torn and finding it hard to believe but at the same time it makes sense that he was just pretending due to many other behaviours he had...?",domesticviolence
boyfriend acted in a rage yesterday *trigger warning*,"Hi so i am just looking for some help/advice on my situation with my boyfriend. Last night after dinner my boyfriend called me a bitch because he thought i was having an attitude towards him and i felt very offended by that, but almost immediately our friend came to visit and we didn't have time to talk about what happened or why he felt compelled to be mean to me. So at 4am when our friend left i was trying to ask him what happened and get a sincere apology from him but he kept shutting me down saying ""i'm tired"" and very minimal bland ""sorry"". I felt extremely frustrated by him because i needed to talk it out before we went to bed.

So after about 5 minutes of this i got up and he was still ignoring me when i kept pressing him about why he can't just understand how he hurt my feelings. I (vigorously) grabbed the pillows he was laying on and threw them on the ground just to make a point, and then took his covers off so he couldn't just be sleeping (as context we were both slightly drunk and i get i was being immature at this point). So he begins to laugh at me which makes me even more mad and calls me a stupid c*nt bitch, or something along those lines. At this point i'm SO fed up so i grab his laptop and say ""i'm taking your laptop and mine"". I did this because i knew he would at least have to look at me and i thought at this point he would just concede for the moment and realize i just need a solid apology in order to go to bed.

so the moment i grab his laptop he jumps out of bed and pushes me to the ground, gets on top of me and puts his hand on my neck and is choking me (not extremely hard but like my airway was definitely restricted), he slaps my face and says ""don't you ever fucking do that again or i'm gonna fucking kill you"" 

at that moment he says ""what.... what's going on... why did i say that"" and i start screaming and run out of the house because i feared for my life. thankfully i am okay and my only injury is around my hip area where he tackled me to the floor.

If anyone has advice or has been in a similar
situation please let me know, this is someone i have been completely in love with and we have plans to get married and everything. I have never really thought this was a toxic relationship but then again i have never seen him in a rage before like this. thank you for your time everyone.",domesticviolence
Moving to a new town,"Hi all, 

I am currently in the process of moving to a new city to escape the toxic environment of the small town where I was born, raised, and my abuser lives.. 

I'm 20 right now and currently, in the middle of going to community college, I'm extremely lost and confused as to make sure I'm settled in this new city.  I did see that there is a Domestic Violence shelter here, but I worry that going there would be a waste of their time. 

To be specific as to what I need help with; transferring colleges properly (this is going alright, the counselors at this new school are helpful albeit slow reply-ers lol), getting a job, getting therapy/counseling for my PTSD, getting an apartment with no credit (I do have a college student credit card but am too scared to use it), just generally moving away from my core support system (this being my mom, cat and dog). 

Thank you if you are able to help guide me in the right direction with this process.",domesticviolence
When will it ever be enough ?please read need help,"Hi all , 

so to sum up to events that happened me and my boyfriend have been on and off for years ... we were friends for a while, me and his family were close so i used to spend nights.. we used to mess around alot sex was amazing and i ended up pregnant with my second child. 1st born turned out wasn't his but we worked things out eventually both said  that friendships/benefits the best. 

we were careless , i ended up keeping baby and not telling him about it until 2 months before my due date. which caused hella confusion between him and his (now ex) leading him to kicked out. 

month went by we would talk here and then , he would always help me when i needed help or advice. even at my lowest point he would pick me back up. he is the most kindest , purest person you will ever meet and i was lucky to have that. waking up to him and just having  him around was the best.

but i guess that wasn't enough for me we moved in together with both kids,he stepped up to be a dad to my 1st born. we were back in a relationship again. i got caught up with texting other guys , he finds out and looses it because he loves me dearly and our family.i felt guilty i didnt need to do that.everything on my end was uncalled for. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since that day, every argument has gotten physical , from a black eye , to a swollen foot , bruises all over my face and body. i know this is all my fault i wouldnt call it domestic violence , i would call it a reaction i put this man through alot , i never understood his anger even though i would feel we would be on good terms but i would always fuck it up by doing something small like having an aditude and not commuicating things that needed to be. 

today was the last straw for it all , i have a cut on my end i bled due to an argument over nonsense like having an abortion

&amp;#x200B;

I DONT KNOW IF I AM WRONG OR HE IS. DO YOU GUYS HAVE ANY TIPS ON DV CASES WITH KIDS INVOLVED. lol you guys my family fell apart in a heart beat , everything is wrong. i will not be pressing any charges against this guy.",domesticviolence
"I had to open up,I cant hold this inside me anymore......","So My Father is very abusive towards my mother he has really short tempers and easily gets triggered by anything my mother asks regarding work or any phone calls he shouts at her and slurs at her calling her disgusting names, we are an well  educated family but whenever he starts talking like that it seems like as if he’s got no moral or any education or he’s straight up from the slums,whenever their arguments heat up my father strikes her with anything near him, (mosquito bats,shoes,sandals) my mother has been bearing these assaults everyday 
Im 16 and during these 16 years i have seen him treat her like an animal, My mother cant even bring up a point without being hit ,His brothers are equally educated but they live a normal sane life 
But in the other hand my father’s like a maniac,He doesn’t care if she dies one day,he will still blame it on her, back in the day he was involved in shady stuff and mother was always worried and she used to ask him about his whereabouts but he wouldn’t comply and instead it would turn into an argument.
He apparently also cheats on my mother as i hear them argue over him talking to girls secretly, he denies everything and proceeds to hit her 
as i grew up i was never happy i was always broken, i was depressed , i even thought of killing myself when i was 12-13, My mother is so oppressed in her own house its just mad,its not normal My Mother is for sure depressed but she cant seek help as she’s too scared of my father , i see my friends playing with their dads like friends but i never got close with my father as im too scared and im mentally scarred,
I dont respect him but i gotta act like i do so that i dont get beaten up but he’s good dad he does provide to the family ,he buys me stuff and i got good things But that doesn’t change the fact that he’s an abuser ,
He’s over 50 and even had a cardiac arrest once but still tries to cheat on the women who sat there in the hospital all day all night praying for him but he still doesn’t respect her enough, Yes my mother is at fault too for instigating the arguments but my father is at fault too for creating the problem first of all.
I’m from Bangladesh, and what can i possibly do to help my mother? I wanted to call the police but im too scared of the consequences, i also step into their arguments and stop him from hitting her ,but for how long can i possibly do that? What can i do to help my mother who’s being physically and emotionally damaged everyday?",domesticviolence
"Just need to get this off my chest really, could use some advice.. My boyfriend dragged me by my hair, put his hand over my face and held me down then broke his way through a door.","We’re both working from home at the minute because of lockdown and have been getting on each other’s nerves more than usual.

But the last time we had an argument, it wasn’t even over anything important, he grabbed me and pulled me to the floor by my hair twice, covered my mouth and nose so I couldn’t breath, I bit my lip somewhere in all this so hard it was bleeding, and then he broke through the door to a locked room when I was trying to leave the situation.

I know this isn’t good and I need to leave, I haven’t been able to sleep since this has happened because all I can think about is what do I do? I feel like I have nowhere to go. We’ve been together about 4 years and we live in a house his family owns, which he doesn’t let me forget, he says it’s his house, when we argue he screams at me to leave when he knows I’ve got nowhere to go. I pay my share of the bills and do all housework because he refuses, I buy pretty much everything for the house. There are multiple holes in the walls where he has punched them in the past, I keep trying to patch them up.

When he’s finished arguing he will go back to saying how much he loves me and how he didn’t mean anything he said. 

Just after the above happened he said if he found out I told anyone what happened he would kill me. When we weren’t arguing he said he hopes I never tell anyone because in his words ‘there’d be lynch mobs going after him’ this came up after someone on Facebook invited him to like a page that was showing support for a girl who’s boyfriend had killed her .. he didn’t like that, he tried to justify what he does and says how he isn’t abusive. He was just trying to stop me screaming, or i shouldn’t have done something. 

I’ve been thinking about leaving and how I would do it but I feel like I can’t leave and rent somewhere because I have pets that’s I don’t want to leave behind, I’d have to wait until I can get enough money together anyway. should I tell someone I trust what’s happened in case it gets worse while I find somewhere else to live? What about when I do find somewhere to live, how do I tell him? Is this something I can report or have I left it too long, it’s been just over a week? I haven’t slept properly since this happened because I’m just worrying constantly. I feel like the whole situation is so much worse because we can’t really go anywhere at the minute and it’s so overwhelming.",domesticviolence
I would like some help or insight... I feel lost,"I apologize for the long read. I haven't told anyone this but I suspect I was/am in an abusive relationship. Everything was fine the first three months but I spent a lot of time with him due to me recently having a sexual trauma and his bed was the only place I felt safe. He always told me it was fine and he was happy with me being there all the time, but there were small red flags. Blaming me for ""having sex"" before him (he was a virgin and before we were official, I had told him I wasn't even though now I don't see it as me having had sex before since it was coerced). He would punch the wall and get unnecessarily angry. He's had a rough childhood (experiencing neglect and I suspect he may have witnessed abuse too) so I just thought he was justified. I stopped hanging out with my friends and going out because he would make me feel bad and ignore my calls if I went out or give me the silent treatment when I came back after a night out, and he would shame me into wearing less revealing clothes. Some of the stuff that happened early on I can't remember because I think I tend to repress the arguments and verbal abuse because they happened often. Anyways, as we got closer and our relationship got older, he stopped liking me being around all the time and said he needed space. I should have complied, but it really hurt me to see a 180 from wanting me there 24/7 to not much at all. One night he went out with his friends without me and some girl kissed him (thats the story...idk what really happened and his friends are totally fine with cheating as he made me aware). After that I had trouble trusting him, but he had exhibited trust issues even before I did because within the first day of us dating he fought with me because I wouldn't let him go through my phone. I (and I know this is not ok behavior I'm not saying it is) started going through his phone after that because I felt a loss of security in our relationship and he was no longer really paying me compliments, being affectionate, expressing interest in sex, etc. I became depressed (I also suspect I have BPD and strong abandonment issues) and I told him, but he was not really supportive of me getting help or recognizing my trauma. He always thought I had no reason to be sad as I was financially comfortable and came from what appears on the outside to be a semi-normal family whereas he has struggled. We started to argue as he no longer tried to make an effort in our relationship and stopped seeming to care about me which really upset me. I really can't remember the first time he got physical with me as we used to ""play fight"" but sometimes he was a little more aggressive than I could handle (I'm a pretty small girl for reference like 100-110 pounds) but would apologize immediately after if I was hurt. Then one time he got angry in my car about something and slapped or punched me (again I think I blocked it out because all I remember was holding my face after and being hurt but with no real visible injury). After that, when he would get aggressive with me or really verbally mean I would slap him on the back almost as hard as I could (which again I feel ashamed of). Our fights became really frequent (sometimes 2-4 a week) where he would tell me to shut up or insult me and I would cry my eyes out so much that he would put a pillow over my head or cover my mouth so his roommate didn't hear me. The most escalated incident happened 2 months ago where he came home from going out with his friends and I was upset that he didn't check in on me and cuddle with me like he promised he would when he got back and I kept calling and texting him while he was in his roommates room because I was feeling anxious and depressed so I walked over to the roommates room and he (what I feel) humiliated me telling me to go away. I then went back to his room and attempted to cut myself for the first time and when I revealed to him that I did it, he told me I was psychotic and had no reason to do so, then when I cried he covered my mouth and neck with his hands, called me a dumbass, then told me he was going to sleep and didn't want to deal with my craziness. I was upset and so I shined my flashlight on him from beside the bed and he picked me up and threw me across the bed so hard it left a bruise because I hit a doorframe where my eyebrow bone is. He did not apologize or offer help after this and when I asked him for ice he screamed at me no. I kept crying until he got me ice and then when I realized it was wrong and wanted to document what happened and seek help, he took my phone, deleted the pictures, then held my phone overnight under his pillow and would not let me have it. I never sought medical attention for that and now I have headaches every day, and even though he took me on a date and told me it was an accident the next day, I still don't forgive him. I know I've engaged in some not healthy behavior probably some from my BPD such as tracking his location, going through his phone, and asking him to hang out with me instead of his friends (ones that told him it was ok to cheat on me). Do you think we're both at fault for this? He's all I have and I'm too ashamed to tell anyone what happened because they would just tell me to leave. I'm so attached to him though and even though we've broken up multiple times and gotten back together, I can't physically get myself to leave without wanting to die. What is wrong with me. If you asked me a few years ago if I thought this would ever be my life, I'd say hell no. I guess some of this is just daddy issues. Any comfort or opinions would be appreciated. Sorry again.

I also feel confused because he goes back and forth saying he doesn't love me anymore and doesn't want to be with me, to basically saying that didn't happen or he only says ""xyz"" because he's angry? I feel like I've been gaslit a lot as he's called me crazy at least 5 times and a cry baby almost every day. I know some of my behaviors were wrong, and I'm currently in therapy trying to work through my abandonment issues. But anything I ask him to do to help me he just ""can't"". Even something as simple as texting me once a day just to say hi or that he loves me. He's a terrible communicator. I hate him and I love him and I hate that I love him and that the person who makes me feel safe also makes me feel unsafe.",domesticviolence
What is wrong with me??,"My baby boy was born at 28 weeks and 1 day and weighed 1 pound and 8 ounces. He spent 89 days in the NICU where he was air lifted soon as he was born. They wanted to air lift me before I delivered so he would have been born with all the NICU staff and doctor's there but I delivered WAY to fast. He made it after a long LONG hard battle in the NICU with breathing and lung complications and heart problems he has to have surgery soon to repair a hole in his heart. He also has a umbilical hernia but that's not super important yet.  They released him 13 days ago to go home and I was completely shocked because we were told it would be June before they considered it..but at 9:00am I got a call from his nurse saying the neonatologist decided to release him with a heart monitor. 

LONG STORY SHORT I was so excited to get my baby boy home so no more traveling three hours to the hospital to see him. I went and got my boy and bring him home And my three older kids were so happy to see their brother and meet him because they haven't got to get because of the coronavirus. 

Well that night my husband got home from work and I thought he would be excited about our baby being home but NO he seemed ill and as the night went on he got so upset and I had no clue why but he started yelling at me because I had not cooked supper instead I picked up take out because I was traveling to get our son and didn't have time. He got louder and louder and he grabbed me and hit me in my left jaw and then when I failed he kicked me 3 times in my belly and the just walked off got in his truck and left. I called the police and made a report and went to hospital for evidence and safety. They caught him later that night driving drunk. 

I AM DOING EVERYTHING I CAN TO SUPPORT MY THREE CHILDREN. OLDER TWO ARE TWO YEARS OLD AND FOUR YEARS. I GOT ALL BILLS PAID BUT I HAD NO MONEY LEFT AFTER AND MY BABY NEEDS FORMULA BADLY HE HAS ENOUGH FOR ONE BOTTLE. SO THAT'S AN EMERGENCY HE IS ON ENFAMIL NUTRAMIGEN DUE TO DAIRY INTOLERANCE AND STOMACH ISSUES...AND I NEED A FEW GROCERIES FOR MY OTHER TWO BABIES WE ARE ON BARE MINIMUM BUT IM DOING EVERYTHING I CAN TO GET BY BUT IM STUCK AT LOSE..I AM CRYING SO HARD RIGHT NOW AND DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO.

The best revenge is to survive.,"It's been one whole week since he broke into my house.. I was sound asleep when I woke up to see him standing over me. He hit me with a glass bottle and strangled me. I was in and out of consciousness . I screamed loud enough for the neighbours to call the cops..He was arrested this time. The physical violence before was minor. I ignored it 

I thought I'd never hear from him again. I was wrong he's been calling me sending me texts about how I betrayed him but he still cares for me . I can't press charges against him and ruin his life. He's mentally unstable I can never blame someone for being sick. 


I accept I can't be with this man and I don't want to see him again but I love him dearly still. I don't think that will ever change. I'm looking at obtaining an injunction. I just find it hard to believe he's willing to risk losing his job and his standard of living... Just to harass and  hurt me.

I need advice on what to do. Please.,"Hey, I've never taken to an online forum before so please, just bear with me. I'm 16 btw with siblings 8 and 10 years old, my parents are in their late forties.

My mom and dad have been together for over twenty years. Every one of those twenty years, my mom has paid the price for seeing good in a damaged person.

My dad came from a broken family and a background of poverty. His dad died when he was a kid, and his mom remarried. Her husband left them after a few years and my dad had to support his mom and two stepbrothers by himself. Left home when he was 15 to work for them. Even after he came to Australia, he'd been sending money home, usually in thousands. This resulted in many arguments, yelling matches and physical abuse. My mom had been tolerating this because she had nowhere to go, no family in the country we live in. This happened up until last year when he promised to never lay a hand on her, and his mom died, so we thought it was over. 

It wasn't. I became the victim of his physical abuse, and mum was now being tortured emotionally. She defended me against him, and he kicked her out of her bedroom and she now has to sleep on a double bed with my other two siblings. Just last week, we went to get help, but mom doesn't want to separate. Mom's holding out, hoping we could get him to change. She reckons he's not a bad person, just doesn't have any control. She's waiting for an apology and an invite back to her own bedroom. It's been four weeks. I think dad wants an apology for her defending me.

I don't know how much more of this I can take. My sisters are innocent and their childhood is being ripped out from under their feet while I can only watch. My mom blames us three for her predicament.  She takes her bitterness out on us. She doesn't know the pain she's causing them from her statements and I'm completely torn. I already have anxiety from my own childhood and I don't want it to happen to them. I'm a good student and I can't concentrate on my schoolwork, and the worst part is that I don't think she's gonna give up on dad. I want out but I can't because mom will expect me to stay, whether she separates with dad or not. It hurts me to see my siblings like this and every time I try to defend or protect them, she ignores me. My family life is destroying me. Seeing my mom and siblings like this is destroying me. I want out. 

Sorry about how lengthy this is, I kinda went on a tangent here. I need advice on what to do. This whole thing is really complicated and it's driving me around the bend. Please.",domesticviolence
Ignored by Social Justice Warrior “Friends”,"I was assaulted and strangled by my husband on March 31st. This was the first time he’d ever hit me, although he was probably emotionally and verbally abusive. A difference I see between my situation and many others is he immediately wanted to get divorced and for me and my daughter to move away, which now makes sense because he wanted to control the narrative and how many people found out about it. He told me he didn’t love me and didn’t want me, so on top of the assault I felt complete rejection. I’m glad on some level, because I didn’t have the option to stay and put up with more abuse, but it still hurts and makes me feel alone as a survivor. 
We lived in a town of 1000 people, I was a hairstylist for many of the people there and very active in the community. We were both from a different city where we knew even more mutual people. We have about 130 mutual friends on Facebook and many more in the small town. After I was able to get what I needed from him in our separation agreement and move to my mother’s, I posted a carefully written statement about my experience on social media. I also personally told many people in our community of friends, and my many clients who wanted to know where I was and when they could get a haircut. I had a huge response, people writing support and telling their own stories. It was really incredible. But the dust has settled and there are many people who never said a word, or acknowledged what happened. They continue to support him, or they say nothing at all. 
Our group of friends is one I would have considered violence-intolerant. They post about me too and believing women, they are liberal and outspoken. But when I went public a lot of them stayed silent. Now they’re posting about police brutality, specifically George Floyd. I watched the video of what happened to him and was triggered into a panic attack, remembering what it was like to not be able to breathe. I’m just as angry about what is happening to black people in America, and I never want to compare my experience, but isn’t it comparable? Isn’t women being abused by men as prevalent as people of color being abused by law enforcement? And I mean this on a very personal level, not just a global one. Why are these people posting constantly about the injustice of what happened to George Floyd, and staying silent about what happened to me? 
I’m so angry and I don’t have anywhere to put it. I posted two things to my IG story yesterday pretty much saying what I’ve said here, but regretted it and took them down. I need support in this and my poor friends are so fatigued, I feel horrible for them. They empathize but can’t relate to what it’s like to be beaten and strangled, kicked out of your home with your child in a pandemic, and to speak out about it and be ignored. I know I’m focusing on the people ignoring me rather than the supportive ones, but it’s like a knife in my heart. This liberal “woke” group of people will speak up for someone they don’t know, but when their voice will actually have an impact they’re silent. And he’ll get away with this and never be held accountable by anyone and I’m sitting here with this horrible pain. 
I don’t know what I need from this group but I’m glad to at least have a place to share this sadness and frustration.",domesticviolence
Court is Monday and I'm scared,"I have a protection order on spouse (threatened suicide with a gun, damaged property, screaming, yelling, and wanted me to come outside and search for him) (he ask killed our dog a year ago he revealed to me recently) I was able to escape with kids after calling police.

When I left he tried calling me multiple times, left a few messages pleading to see me and the kids. He got his father to call me and leave me a message (he sounded sad and upset) asking me to come over to talk.

Spouse showed up at my work trying to get in and wanting to see me. He left because I wasn't there. When he was served with VPO he took his guns and left the house.

He returned within 24 hours to get all of his stuff (no proof it was him)

He hasn't tried to contact or bother us. I found out he lost his job a few days after his episode. Attorney is also working on filing for divorce.

I have court Monday and I'm so afraid. I'm going to have an advocate and ask to see if we can have a police escort.

Besides that, does anyone have any advice or encouragement? I literally have no family or friends I can place these burdens upon. I don't know what's going to happen and I just want to be safe.",domesticviolence
Best friend just told me her boyfriend hits her. She lives with him in a different city. What to do?,"(We are both in our early 20s)

She moved to the city her boyfriend lives in a few months ago and lives with him, his mother and sister. 

She told me today, and doesn’t want to let her family know because she knows they’ll call the police and she doesn’t want that. (her family and all her friends, including me live in the capital city)

She works but currently doesn’t have enough to pay a deposit, 1 month rent AND rent on top of that. She was planning on leaving months ago but didn’t expect this to happen this soon. 

She doesn’t want to come back to the capital city because she loves her current job but it worries me knowing that she’s in a city where the only person she knows well is her abuser. 

I don’t think she would want to go to a women’s shelter. What should I do? I’m SO worried about her right now, I also want her to visit a doctor since she was complaining about pain.

How do I get myself to stop caring for my abuser?,"I just recently ended my relationship with someone who was very very abusive to me a few days ago. It got to the point where he slammed me to the ground, the wall, and on the bed. He's choked me, pressed on my eyes, kicked and punched me. I know this all sounds ridiculous and anyone in their right mind would immediately know to switch gears and not care for this person. I don't know why I find myself still caring for this person. We had so much history together and he's tried to seek therapy himself but still repeats these behaviors. There were times where he was able to remain calm and asked that he leave so he could be in a better headspace to return and have civil conversations, but all that seem to go out the window when he snaps. 

 I don't like that I still care and miss him. I've blocked all contacts because I know that's what needs to happen because it got out of hand and he still tries to call me from an unknown number. Im afraid I might cave in one day and pick up. I know I shouldn't. Also, this is very embrassing to admit, but I can't help but desire our sexual chemistry again. I know that's not a healthy love, but i don't know how to wrap my head around why I feel the way I do. With this whole covid 19 shelter in place, it's been hard to get a support group going. I've already called the national domestic abuse hotline and they've linked me to my local group, but even they've haltered meetings and so I'm looking for any support I can get so that I don't go back into making the same mistakes again, thank you for taking the time to read this.",domesticviolence

How to assist a victim?,"betterfindurheart1907:34 PM
Yo shut the fuck up you troll! If you are really in trouble find a damn shelter. Don’t blame strangers for your mistakes. At least protect your son! If you’re with your abuser then that is your fault no one else’s! Walk to the damn gas station and get gas. You dumb bitch!""

ANOTHER PERFECT RESPONSE

""You know what lady, short of someone giving you cash, there is nothing to help your immediate situation. I’m guessing you conveniently ran out of gas far from resources.
Probably time to start waking to the nearest gas station with your kid and dog, and ask there if someone can help you. Sitting on your device arguing with people is a waste of time. Considering you have no gas, wonder what will happen when you have no access to internet? Batteries don’t last forever""

I'm posting those since the mods aren't doing shit. Trying to defend myself and everything gets locked. Rules only apply to certain people. Y'all do me a favor when the next mother/kid is killed by the abuser don't ask or say ""why didn't she just leave"". The abuser has already alienated the victim from friends and family and made sure there is no resources available to leave. There are cities being burned to the ground humanity is nonexistent and nobody is equal.",domesticviolence
"Caught girlfriend cheating in chat, she pulled a gun","I was dating my now 43 year old ex-girlfriend for 5+ years. We've had serious issues here and there, I've been thrown out and left a bunch of times. She's cheated on me on Tinder 6+ times. She was always trashing me to her friends on social media. One of her friends egged her on to keep cheating on me. She almost left me for someone else once. Her adult son went crazy one morning, and threatened me with a knife, and stabbed our kitchen table.

Our issues stemmed from a bunch of different sources: her son (20) was a drug addict and a drug dealer who didn't clean up after himself. Her oldest daughter (23) was a drug addict that was also a cutter and was bulimic. Her younger daughter(18) was also a drug addict and later became a drug dealer. She had one son who was a good student in school who had no real issues. (19).

She was former Army going through a divorce with a somewhat indifferent husband who had moved on with a younger woman. I had been divorced 2 years, and was living alone, when she was involuntarily separated from the Army for high year tenure, and was about to lose her housing.

We had known each other in high school, but not well. We hung out a few times. In fact, I asked her to marry me when I was 18 and she was 16, but she said ""no"".

We began talking on Facebook Messenger, and she would go into another room and talk to me, for hours and hours. We got along great. Eventually she surprised me and came down to see me, December 26, 2014, and stayed for a while, until things got crazy back home. She bought me a car, as I had lost mine in some wrangling with my ex-wife during my divorce, an old.Buick, but hey, it was a car, and I loved her for helping me.

She left again in February,  but we reunited on Valentine's day for a Hozier concert in Seattle, which she arranged and paid for. She had gotten severance pay from the Army. She lived off this for a good while, and didn't work for around 3 months or more. 

It was a good time, and I loved her, but even then, I knew I couldn't please her. She had a huge sex drive, and I had suffered a bit from erectile dysfunction. I had some pills, but they were old, but I had underlying problems with my blood pressure and blood sugar that were causing problems.

Eventually, she moved back in with me, and we had a great life, just laughing and talking and spending time together. Her oldest daughter was living on her own in D.C., her youngest daughter and oldest son was living with her dad in San Antonio, and her younger son, the food student, came to live with us, and she brought her 3 dogs, 2 golden retrievers and a small terrier mix.

Eventually, things got bad at the exhusbands place, so the you get daughter and oldest son came to live with us in a small, 700ft 1 bedroom apartment. 

Eventually, we had to move. The daughter kept skipping school and getting the property management to let her in where they could see the 3 large dogs, so we were asked to leave, also based on occupancy. We had 5 people in there.

When we moved to the new neighborhood, my girlfriend asked her oldest daughter if she wanted to live with us, and she brought her Russian live-in boyfriend, and broke up with him on the same day, but he continued to live with us for a year. My girlfriend at this time was a nurse, so she make good money. I wasn't making very much, and I felt like such a mooch. I had paid all the bills at our old apartment, as I had when I lived alone, but I had little left over after child support was taken out. I helped where I could, I always did the dishes, the laundry, cleaning the whole house, vacuuming...I tried to make her life easier in ways that I could, since I couldn't help in financial ways. I loved her deeply, but I always felt a bit outnumbered and outvoted, and had no real say in anything.

A year or so later, I lost my job, and was unemployed for a year. I took great care of the house, but she despised my not working. She was paying for everything related to the house, and I was taking care of it, but I really wasn't that big of a burden, I was cleaning up after 4 kids that weren't mine, and one live in boyfriend, occasionally taking them to school when they missed the bus, or I would drive them to work. At some point, her oldest son began bringing drug addicts and derelicts around the house, and I had words with him about it. My girlfriend hated me disciplining her kids, but she wasn't doing it, either. She let them run all over her, cursing her out, calling her names, disrespecting her...something I put a stop to. You'd think she'd appreciate that, but she felt it was causing a problem in her relationship with her kids.

She began going on Tinder and hooking up with random guys for quickies. Once, she even let one guy watch once. She began seeing a guy named Jim, leaving me alone with her kids while she went to have sex with him. She would lie and say she was going to fo look at a table for sale or go to a thrift shop.

Things got real bad for a while, when the oldest daughter threw her boyfriend out, and turned to alcohol. She would get driven home by the bartender so they could go home. She would dump hundreds of dollars out on the ground and leave her cellphone, and new iPhone, in the street.

Her oldest son had gotten thrown out of two schools, and was now on his 3rd time as a senior. He and his friends stole a wallet from a truck at a nearby construction site, which brought the police to our home. They drew guns on me, demanding I turn him over. He wasn't even home. Our house became the bad house in the neighborhood where the cops were always called.

My girlfriend helped me find another job, and let me drive her truck, while she sold her car to her son so he could go to his academy school for special students across town. She was a nurse for the same company I worked for, though in different cities. We could communicate on Skype to one another all day. It was beautiful. I still didn't make enough ro support her, but I would come home, and clean, and do car repairs, and build projects for her. Anything she asked for.

Eventually, the youngest daughter became a problem, with drugs and alcohol and skipping school, and one got her boyfriend to try and run me over with his car,...and she moved back with her father. She moved back 6 months later, with a new drug habit, and was even worse. She was climbing in and out of windows, lying about working, and staying gone days at a time. The oldest daughter had herself committed, met a friend inside, tried to convince us the friend should move in, and got a job as a waitress in a strip club.  The oldest son kept bringing trashy friends over in the middle of the night, making our house smell like pot, and sneaking his younger sister out for parties. The oldest sister gave her alcohol and she almost killed herself with alcohol poisoning, and the police came, having been called because she had been drinking on Facebook Live.

The oldest son came home high, and shit in the backyard. My girlfriend confronted him, and he started acting like he was going to hit her. I shouted from upstairs, and he came up the steps at me with a knife. My girlfriend called the police, and he was arrested. She bailed him out, which caused a fight. We worked through that, she got him his own place, the youngest daughter found some drug counselor to live with, and my girlfriend had a fight with the oldest daughter when she came home drunk again, and the oldest daughter moved out, too, leaving just the good student son, who then found a friend to move out with, leaving just the two of us again.

My girlfriend had quit her job, and went back to college to be a doctor. It was hard and stressful. The truck died, and I had built up enough credit to buy a new car. My girlfriend bought two more cars, whixh i fixed up for her, was in accidents in both, and got one more last car.

Things were okay. She had too much time on her hands, and began starting fights when I came home because she wanted to do something and I was just trying to relax. I still couldn't match her libido. 

Eventually I come home, and she tells me she has started talking to a cousin she hadn't spoken to in 10 years. I don't think much of it at first, but she's going into closed rooms to talk to him. I catch a few screens of their chats online, and they're really suggestive for cousins. I mentioned it, and she said there was nothing to worry about.

She had been repairing her credit. She wanted to buy a house. Waived in an HOA, and the rent was terrible. She got her VA home loan, and we were preparing to move. We had found this house she loved because it was on a lot of land for her plants and dogs, and it had a handicap accessible bathroom off of the master bedroom, which she said she selected for me, because I have bad knees. It wasn't one floor, like we had talked about, but it was nice. It was older, and the wiring was crazy, and there were lots of things that needed to be done. It was a good project house, and I would be kept busy.

We're in the midst of moving and packing, and she's hiding in other rooms, talking to this ""cousin"". I eventually open the door, and ask just what is going on. This was similar to the way I was talking to her when she was about to move on from her ex-husband, so my suspicion was going off. 

For the scene I started, she broke up with me, and I was told it was over, that she didn't want me to move with her, al.ost like it was planned that way. She had a meeting with her kids, and had a chat with her friend that was always pushing her to leave me, that she was either going to not buy the house and just move in with her cousin, or buy the house and all the kids could move back in because apparently I was the problem, and now I was out of the picture. 

Her kids expressed interest, especially the older waitress daughter and the drug addict son. They hadn't had particularly successful stints living on their own.

I made one last ditch effort to save the relationship, and she relented. I was back in. She made the announcement to the kids, and the oldest waitress daughter flat out said it was a mistake, according to the relationship advice she read on Tumblr. 

We moved. Some days the kids would help. Most days they didn't. I unloaded 2 Uhaul trucks by myself. I was trying to do all the things my girlfriend always wanted me to do. I took my Viagra, even though it used to make me feel bad, and we started having sex 3 to 4 times a day. We were making bold plans for this new house. Her drug addict son moved in. The waitress daughter, too. I tried to make peace. They made their plans when I wasn't going to be here.

We were doing really great, except she was still talking to this cousin an awful lot, even talking calls when we were eating together or having a conversation. 

She had made some plans to visit this cousin and the rest of her family, supposedly. She wasn't forthcoming with the date, but apparently it was a plan put in motion in the brief period we were broken up.

About two weeks before the visit, she starts to go cold. She doesn't want sex anymore, because I had satisfied that craving. She didn't want to kiss me if I was too sweaty. She was pushing me away, and talking to him more. Evey time I said something about it, she said I was being insecure. 

Last Saturday, I ask when she was leaving. She said June 3rd. She said she didn't know when she was coming back. That was how it was when she came to stay with me, too. I said something about it. I asked if she was going to unblock me on Facebook (she had blocked me when we broke up), so I could chat with her all the time when she was with him, like he was foing when she was with me, or if I was her dirty little secret.

She got up and left for an hour. Then she suggested we unpack some boxes in the bedroom together. She starts saying she never goes out, never gets to wear these pretty dresses. I don't take her anywhere nice. She leaves again for four hours this time. She comes back and tells me not to bother unpacking my things. ""There's no trust, no respect, and you hate my kids"".

I was floored. It wasn't even an argument. It was if her mind was made up by someone else. She was dead cold, and wanted nothing to do with me. I began packing my things back up again.

I try to make peace. Nothing. I try to ask her daughter what I should do, and I notice her daughter is saying the same things her mother said. I had accused her of a crime, of incest, and that was insulting. 

It gets to a point where I'm ready to leave, apparently for good. My ex-girlfriend says she was going to offer for me to stay until I found a place, if i fixed up her house with all the things i had planned to while she was gone, and maybe she would miss me, and maybe we could talk when she got back, whenever that was. Her oldest daughter was hiing to move out in a month, her oldest son was going to move in with his dad in two months, she needed someone to watch her dogs.

I agreed. At least it was a small glimmer of hope, and I had a place to stay, and didn't have to drastically alter my life. I was still heartbroken she was going to leave with our relationship in shambles.

There were little hints she still cared. She cracked jokes with me. I collect Transformers and she still went down the aisle and would tell me what they had. She had watched on our Ring cam and saw me throw away a McDonald's bag, so she knew I was eating, despite being heartbroken. 

I had made about of changes last time we broke up. I was making more now. I changed my debit pin to her birthday, like she always wanted. I made my Facebook profile pic a pic of us together. I was going to a therapist. I was looking into getting my disability pay increased. I was in line for a transfer and a promotion. I had found a program that would pay me to take care of her for her disability, that would make up in the money she was losing from college. She was using the GI Bill, but Covid was keeping her home in a virtual class, and that gave her extra time, and she spent that extra time talking to her cousin. I had told her I had some paperwork to fill out, and I had an interview the next day, and they money would be enough to cover the mortgage or my half of the combined bills. Finally, I was going to be able to contribute in a meaningful way. I had given her sex, and she still canned me. Now I was about to give her a large amount of money. 

I came home, and she was mowing the grass. She was looking very sexy, wearing this black top I always thought looked good. I told her I needed to talk to her, she said she'd come inside when she was finished. I thought for sure shed be happy, and consider taking me back. When we had talked earlier about all they ways I helped her, it almost seemed like she had gone soft again, and realised I really did love and care for her, and showed it in the best ways I could. 

I went upstairs and saw her laptop was open. I moved the mouse, it was on Facebook. I looked at the chat. There it was.

A lurid sex chat with her cousin. She was talking about it gushing like Hoover dam, and about how she couldn't wait to be with him. There were nudes exchanged. A video chat. He said she went three deep. She said it tasted great. It was perverse. It was dirty. It was very much like the sex we had the month before.

Her daughter had told me there was nobody else and I was an asshole for accusing her of a crime, something my girlfriend echoed later, letting me know the daughter had planted the seeds of the breakup. She had even said she wanted all of her mother's attention and felt she couldn't get that when we were doing well together, but here it was: she was chatting with someone else, and that someone else was her cousin, and it was incest. 

I wasn't crazy. I knew it all along. She just kept me for the move. She just kept me for the labor. Now she was going to go fuck her cousin after breaking up with me so she could justify and legitimize it and say it wasn't cheating because we weren't together. 

I called her into the kitchen and confronted her with what I saw. She immediately grew irate. She demanded I delete it from my phone. I refused. She said ""You're going to ruin me! Destroy me!""

She went into the bedroom. I took this chance to leave. When she came out of the bedroom, she had her gun in her hand. I went into the garage. She locked and loaded the gun behind me. It was a Walther PPX. There was no safety. That gun was ready to fire.

She shoved my back, forcing me into the dryer. I shoved her away, and went for the door...I went out and through the gate and felt the gun in my back. I spun around to get by her and close to my car. She stopped me, and kicked at my bad knee twice, then thrust her knees toward my knee or groin. She grabbed at the pocket for my phone. I dodged all her attacks, and was holding the gun back with one hand. She kept saying my name. I asked what she was afraid of. She shoved the barrel of the gun into my chest, I felt the barrel was right at my heart. There was anger and evil in her eyes. I heard her say my name through pursed lips and clenched teeth. I heard her finger on the trigger.

We were now at the end of the driveway. I had always told her, she or her son was one day going to kill me, and to save jail time, say it was suicide. It would be believable. I've been depressed since our breakup, and everyone knew that.

I couldn't get to my car. It was too far to go anywhere by foot to be out of range. I had accepted it: I was about to die.

Then i saw a young woman on the sidewalk across the street, and shouted out ""Please hell.me, she's going to kill me, she has a gun! Please call 911!"" and the young woman did, and reported what she saw.

The police came, and arrested my ex-girlfriend for aggravated assault with weapon, and battery, and I left alone, heartbroken, and confused.",domesticviolence

I went to hangout with Chad. Just to have a good time, hang out.
Little did I know I was walking into the story of my own attempted murder.
Everything was going great. We were having a great time. For the first week anyway.
He kept trying to get me to message his ex. He thought I knew where she was at. He thought I had his phone tapped and that I was working for the feds, and was trying to set him up. I couldn't give him any answers either and that started pissing him off. My last week with him was pure hell.. torture. Literally.
It started one morning, he'd been up all night. Picked me up by my throat, started choking me. Hit me a few good times. Then while I was down started pressing his knee into my chest. Told me he'd just keep doing that until I stopped breathing. That it would look like I had a heart attack. No one would know any different.
He wouldn't let me leave at this point. Threatened my family. Took my phone. Even started messaging my friends and everyone. That night he was supposed to go see his mom at the hospital and made me go.
Going down Route 2 he continued hitting me. So I opened my door and tried to jump out but he grabbed my hair and pulled me back in. I kicked and fought but he was stronger than me. That's when he took me down by the river. Saying everything would be fine and he'd let me live if I would just tell him the truth and answer his questions.
But I didn't have his answers. So I was beat some more. He was going to kill me and throw me in the river.
Then he said that would be too easy. No, he was gonna keep me alive and torture me until I gave him answers.
So we went back to his house.
Monday, March 9, 2020 is the day he slipped. One small mistake.
He took me to St. Mary's in Huntington, WV with him so he could visit his mom. Told me to wait in the truck.
Soon as he turned the corner and was out of sight I took off. Ran to the emergency room while I had 911 on the phone telling them what was going on.
I'm safe for the time being. But I'm terrified.. if he finds me, I'm dead.

"Trigger hard after watching Epstein show, my take away","My take away from watching the mini series:

5 years on and the abuse from my ex still affects me?,"Hi guys, hope that this is the right place to post as I’ve been considering writing this for a while. I’m not sure how to start this but I’ll give a bit of background. Basically I’m a male and I met my ex in my final year of uni and I think I was swept away by the fact that she was smart, wealthy, etc etc and couldn’t believe that she actually wanted to be with me. She was great with my friends at first and when I graduated and wanted to stay in the city, I was happy to take up her offer of living with her until I found my own place and the following year we would move closer to my hometown where she would study for her masters degree. This is where it all changed...

(Sorry guys, on reread this is quite long so feel free to just skip to the last paragraph if you want to see my question)

Over the next two years she became increasingly violent and aggressive. She would dig her nails into my arm and punched me in the head on several occasions. Once, I put my arm up in self defence and it caused a bruise on her wrist which she would constantly use against me to make me feel like a bad person. My friends who she liked at first became “bad influences” and just the mention of them would flare up arguments so eventually it became easier not to see/mention them to avoid this. She changed the plan to move near to my hometown without telling me by enrolling for her masters at the same uni. Near the end of the relationship my mental health was struggling, especially following the death of my grandad and I wanted to seek counselling which she wouldn’t allow me to because I’d be a “weirdo”. I finally found the strength to leave her when she said she was going for dinner with friends and by chance I spotted her having a romantic meal with another guy.

I have too many instances of abuse and those are just some that I can pull from the top of my mind and I know that they’re not half as bad as what some have experienced on this thread. I’ve since moved back to my hometown and my friends have welcomed me back with open arms which I don’t deserve. I’ve also met the girl of my dreams who is the most intelligent person I’ve ever met, so understanding, supportive and exactly what I’ve always wanted in a partner. We own a house together and are due to be married next year.

The point I’m trying to make is that I often find myself feeling bitter towards my ex and all of those years that she has taken from me. I often think about the fact that she is free to do what she wants and that some poor guy is probably being abused by her right now and that could be down to me. I’m not sure that there’s much I can do now and I’ve tried to help friends who seem to show signs of being in controlling relationships but it never seems to scratch the itch. I also want to stop feeling like my friends secretly hate me for abandoning them. I thought that this would subside over the years but I find myself here after 5 years just as bitter as ever and wondering what I can do to move forward.",domesticviolence
Please help a friend in need!,,domesticviolence
Please help- trial,"Please help-Trial

To make a long story short, I was abused physically/sexually/emotionally long term by my husband. There is a lot of evidence of this thanks to a therapist who was excellent at documentation and recommendations to keep me as safe as possible until I was hopefully no longer brainwashed enough to stay. However, before I ever reached this point, cops were called by a witness, and there is a huge pending trial post-stay at home order that has been continued for over a year. 

I am extremely fearful for my life. As trial approaches, my anxiety is insurmountable. I don’t want to look at him, though I’m sure I will be asked. I’ve been told by my attorneys that his (expensive) attorney is known to be brutal and preys on the abuser-victim dynamic/mentality to win their case. 

Last night I stupidly ventured into our old messages. I wanted to know if I was better, or if his words could still make me believe I deserved every beating, unforgivable comments, etc. 

When he thought I had reason to call the cops or when I said his physical violence upset me, he would later text me that I beat him. Even though I’ve never laid a hand on anyone in my life. I only ever ducked and covered, I was never able to fight back. I completely froze in every incident. 

I am terrified as he was so calculated and the jury or judge will favor him because of his attempts to cover his tracks. Despite audio evidence of him admitting to abusing me. During which, when I would remind him abuse is illegal and he could lose his military job, he would say “you beat me I don’t know what you’re talking about”. 

Will a jury understand that manipulation is part of the abuse I endured or will I be torn apart on the stand in attempt to protect myself/others from him? 

I am utterly petrified. I am on the verge of a panic attack just thinking about trial which is a considerable amount of time away. I’ve read that to a judge or jury, anxiety behaviors such as fidgeting, looking down, etc. can make you look dishonest but being in the same room with him or seeing his face could throw me into flight or fight mode and I’m afraid I will not be able to appear any more brave, put together, or sincere. 

I feel as if I “lose” no matter the outcome. I convicted, he warned me he would ruin my life, kill me, etc. if this affected his job, family, what have you. On the other hand, he is so calculated I fear no one would ever believe me no matter how many photos, videos, etc. I had. 

There is also the fact that it’s been postponed for so long, details have become fuzzy and I am afraid if my memory doesn’t serve me perfectly and consistently, my testimony will be irrelevant despite the hours of trauma I will revisit and yet again, endure. 

Anyone with advice about getting through this, or experience with bench trials, ideas for coping skills before/during the trial, etc. are extremely appreciated.",domesticviolence
"If your significant other throws objects at you out of anger, is one time too many?","-Does it matter if your SO missed you?

-Does it matter that the objects probably would not have hurt you?

-Why would you give your SO another chance?

-Would you tell anyone about your SO’s behavior, like their family? (Other than law enforcement).

I originally posted this in r/relationships but it was removed by moderators to avoid trolling. 

Background: I am interested in everyone’s perspective based on a recent event in my life. My girlfriend (27F) threw objects at me (28M) out of anger after I told her I did not see a future with her based on her emotionally abusive behavior (we have had this conversation before).  She missed, and they weren’t things that necessarily would have hurt me or caused significant damage. She stopped throwing things after I threatened to call the police. 

To add, the conversation preceding this revolved around her trying to convince me to move back and how I was not comfortable doing so. 

We separated earlier this year, and she has since attended therapy. She believes attending therapy for a few months should be enough for me to return to live with her, and that I have to live with her to see how she has changed. 

She has never done this before, but has had issues in the past controlling her anger. She was somewhat apologetic after the incident, but said it was both of our faults and one of us should have de-escalated the situation.  (I don’t buy it)

Frankly, prior to the incident I was not comfortable returning to live with her. Now, I’m not quite sure if I even want to *see* her again, let alone share a living space. 

And in case anyone is wondering, I have *never* thrown anything at her out of anger. Her behavior was not an act of self-defense. 

Of course, I love her and hope she gets better. That’s why this has been difficult for me.

TL;DR: Estranged girlfriend threw things at me out of anger. I didn’t get hurt (she missed), she is a little apologetic. If your significant other throws things at you out of anger, is one time too many?",domesticviolence
My wife hit me in the back with a glass bottle and grabbed me by the neck,"So my wife and I (46M) got into an argument about whether the kids had to turn off video games by midnight. We disagreed and it was getting heated so I said I wanted to leave and we could talk when people were more calm. My 17M son wouldn’t let me leave the room. I tried to get by and he started shoving me. I forcibly moved him out of the way and was walking to my room when my wife hit me in the back with a glass bottle. I asked her to just let me go and let’s calm down. She grabbed me by the neck. I started to film her and she immediately let go. 

A little background: I’ve had a really bad last few years. I was laid off and unemployed. I became seriously depressed and tried antidepressant medication as well as psilocybin mushrooms. I have been quite upset and angry at moments. It was probably emotionally abusive. I have been seeing a therapist. My wife went twice but she stopped saying the problems are mine. I still go. 

I don’t know what to do. I told my wife it was not ok but she said she should have hit me harder because I deserved it and that I’m a big ninny. Never in my marriage (almost 20 years) have either of us gotten physical. I don’t know what to do. Should I take the children and separate for a bit? Do I call the police?  Do we try to just negotiate this? Four hours later and she is still not apologetic and says I deserved it. I love her so much. I know I put her through a tough time with my depression and I know she’s exhausted and stressed. But physical violence (while all my children were watching) really scares me.",domesticviolence
How to deal with situation where I am stuck living with abusive ex who won't leave?,"I don't know why it is like this. I am going to refer to my ex as M.

&amp;#x200B;

I broke up with M at the beginning of this year and several trying years of trying to break it off and being taken seriously (6 years regretfully together). For much of the relationship, we had a dead bedroom. When I would threaten break up and talk about how I was suffering, suddenly my complaints would be addressed, but maybe just for that day or few days. We'd have sex and M would finally do the chores (or pay his long awaited month's rest -- just for that month's rent -- after on and off months of him not paying). However, other times when I tried to force a breakup, M would have a suicidal breakdown and then I would freak out. M would also ignore and tell me that we not broken up even if we discussed it. This time, however, things were different. M finally agreed to a break up and agreed to be out by March (we are both on the lease). Well, March passed, then April, and now May. They have only managed to save up $1200 within that time as they have told me that they blew it on drugs and video games (and I know other things).

They agreed to end of July, but when I brought it up today they said that they ""hoped"" to move out by then. I then suggested that they could have the apartment as it would allow for them not to have to pay many of the fees and deposits. They got incredibly upset, told me they couldn't afford them, and that my goal was to financially ruin them since they felt the apartment @ $1200/month (not including utilities) was too expensive for them (they make the same amount as me, but purchased a used luxury car, ran up credit, and have student loans). I told them that I just wanted to separate and that I had hoped that by them having the apartment, it would be easier on them. They could then pay the remaining 5 months and go elsewhere, if they'd like. During that discussion, they began giving me the silent treatment and wouldn't even look at me. After several hours, they then came back and said that they would agree to keep the apartment if they could do so at the end of July and I told M that that would defeat the purpose.

Even more hours later, they calmed down, and started acting affectionate. I have been stuck in quarantine with them for the last two months. I go out just to the store and see no one else. I have been going to Zoom meetups and trying to call friends, but am so incredibly lonely and miss the in-person connection. I finished school recently, so I have less to occupy myself with and distract me from the loneliness. I feel like, despite being broken-up and 100% wanting M to move-out, it's hard not to be friendly and affectionate. I am lonely and I just want someone I can talk to and curl up next to. It's so stupid. When I am greyrocking, they take away my personal items like my phone and computer (even made like they were going to destroy my computer), scream at me, kick things, and so on.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no place to escape to as they are able and do unlock all of the doors that I try to hide behind. It's at such a hot, unsafe temperature that it isn't safe to just take a walk outside and none of my friends live close to me. I am never given any privacy and when M starts a fight, M will continuously badger me until I scream at them or react. Then, they will smirk and tell me I am the abuser.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do.  I am tired of being screamed at, belittled, having slurs thrown at me, lied to, left to a dirty house, and without privacy. What are my best courses of action? They have said they will sue me if I try to move-out. I have been journaling the events, but I feel like this whole thing is hopeless. I hate that I still seek attention and affection, too. I feel so disgusted with myself. I also feel like M jumps between hot and cold to punish me and demonstrate that they have control in the relationship. Is this why abuser will seem really angry and/or distant one moment, super affectionate the next, and then angry/belittling?",domesticviolence
App idea?,"Hi all,

I have a few questions I was hoping you might be able to provide me!

I just want to start by saying that this is (barely) an app idea but I wanted to check if it was worth it for victims. I'll briefly explain what I've thought of so far...

Firstly I presume that there is a lot of surveillance in these situations and was wondering how far does it go. E.g. social media for example.
I thought that for safety's sake having a skin (for example a duplication of some boring app like calculator) that can be only removed with a password
- is this likely to work? Do you think that person will notice a duplication of an app they don't use often?

Secondly the app itself... I was going to try and see to make it more of a ""collection of evidence"" so when that person manages to break the cycle they have the proof, I've seen a few posts about the police's limitations/lack of interest and I thought perhaps this would help? So things I thought you could store in here
- photos (not accessible from gallery) or videos/voice recordings, maybe pdfs of any hospital visits that would record this?
- a diary of some sort, either for your own use or to note attacks/incidences
- if possible some sort of secret bank account, but I can see some limitations of this happening due to potential surveillance on bank statements. 
- resources/advice 

Any comments on what I have listed or further ideas?

How do my mom and I escape my emotionally abusive father?,"My alcoholic father has been verbally, emotionally, and mentally abusive for over 16 years. It’s gotten worse over the years and he recently threatened physical violence against my mother.

My parents act completely normal with other people and I feel ungrateful.,"I (23F) still live with my parents (53M, 45F). I wish I had the opportunity to leave the house way before, but I couldn't live alone since I had seizures on a daily basis. Now I feel better and with a change of medication I have gone from several seizures a day to absolutely no seizures.

My parents are extremely traditional. Traditional, overprotective and maybe... abusive? I still feel guilty calling them abusive. Why? They are extremely protective and worried about my health. When I was at the hospital they were very caring. Nurses and doctors told me ""You have a very supportive and loving family, unlike most people we see on a regular basis unfortunately"".  When I was ill, my mother would come everyday even at night (even when she was not on holidays), and all I could do at the time was complaining about my health issue and crying a lot. My dad would bring me nice food almost everyday because the hospital food was not so great as you would expect. Even friends and extended family find my parents ""overprotective"" but adorable and extremely loving.

**However, I still don't understand most of their behavior :**

\- When I was younger my parents would argue everyday at night, I would hear them throwing dishes against the wall, yelling in another room, slamming doors... I was confused and scared. I was also scared for my mother, I thought that my dad would be able to kill my mother if he wanted to. Once my dad went absolutely furious because of my mother's ""manipulative and disrespectful behavior"" and he made violent threats. It was terrible for my siblings and we had to leave the house with my mother for a few hours, just in case.

I have tried several times to talk about these events to my mother years later and she told me ""he's just furious at the moment but two hours later he forgets about it"". That's true. And to be fair he is not always like that. Most of the time he's just very kind and funny. But he completely has anger issues with me and my mother. My other siblings do everything to please him so he never really has any issues with them, I was always the ""rebel"" one according to both of my parents because I have some insight about their behavior and yes I do have a ... controversial temperament, I am the only one among my siblings. Otherwise every single person I have met see me as extremely polite and not an argumentative person.

But... yesterday, many years later... he did exactly the same thing with me. I was wearing a beanie in hot weather because I didn't have time to blow dry my hair properly. I know that it's not the right time to wear a beanie but I don't think I caused him prejudice by wearing my beanie. He went completely furious, yelled in front of me and said ""Now just SHUT UP or I am going to humiliate you in front of everyone in the street and in public places"", which he almost did in front of someone before I left and cry.

I told my mother about what happened, she said I was ""oversensitive"", and that this event was ""created by my own imagination"", ""you know I have always known that you were extremely creative, even as a child"", (I must admit that I was extremely sensitive as a child but I would never lie or make false statements about events which truly happened and I don't have any history of pathological lying). Once she even said that I was ""oversensitive"" and ""giving to much importance to bad people"" when I tried to confess about things that happened to me in school, such as extreme bullying including repeated rape threats.

**Another event :**

I cannot date anyone besides the context of marriage, so when my parents learnt that I was dating someone (I was 17) and lied for the first time about seeing a female friend instead of my boyfriend they also went furious, started to beat me, bite me, pulled my hair. It was **extremely violent**. They called me names ""slut"", ""shame to the family"", ""in our family dating without marriage is FORBIDDEN every woman here knows that, you're the only one, you don't respect your own father"" They also locked me in a room, took my mobile phone and more, I couldn't even call the cops. But several years later this even was completely forgotten. I believe that the reason why they stopped being so mean with me is that they knew I would speak against them to other family members. And I have decided to forgive them for that event. I was too kind. The beanie event was way too much.

&amp;#x200B;

**Other events**

\- Trying to make me feel like a ""spoiled child"" for having food and water. I had to take extremely cold showers for years because my parents just didn't care at all about it. The only time I was ""spoiled"" (I wasn't *really* spoiled but they cared about me) was after being in the emergency room at the hospital, so it was way later.  But despite that I still think my parents worked hard for me for me and my siblings.

\- My mother was calling me names as a child

\- When my grades were not good enough, I was beaten and yelled at, **because most of the time** I had excellent grades, **except when I was ill and bullied**

\- Cannot leave the house alone or even with friends in the evening and at night, my father has to be there to drive me at the place. ""For my own safety"", ""to avoid getting raped or murdered"".

**What I want to do now**

Leave in a few months ""for my studies"" officially, because I am done living with them exactly. I might have an apartment after summer. I am not even doing therapy for two reasons.  I have a bad experience with a therapist who couldn't admit that the issue was more than ""overprotective parenting"" and I want to save money for the next few months. If they won't let me leave (I don't want to have the police involved) I will have to go on my own without them noticing the day I leave, just with a backpack. Since I won't have anyone in my family to help me with the apartment moving stuff, I am probably going to leave a lot of belongings in my parents' house. Since I might cut contact with them if things don't turn well it will probably be lost. But my safety and well-being are more important and I realize I have been in denial my whole life.

But now I feel completely lost. My entire life has been a lie : my ""parents"" are not the ""kind"" people I thought they were and I don't feel safe anymore. I want to stop confessing stuff to my mother because she makes me feel like a complete ungrateful liar, which I am not. And when I talk to other people about my parents, either they think I am overreacting because ""it's obvious that they love me despite all the bad stuff"", either they believe me but think I just have to ""disobey"", ""you're an adult after all"". Yes, an adult, but terrified of my own parents and their reactions.

Tl;dr: I feel completely ungrateful for calling my parents ""abusive"" (when they can actually be violent, for innocent things like dating or wearing a beanie in hot weather, which can be seen as a lack of respect in my parents' eyes), because they make me feel like a spoiled person for having access to decent housing and food. I want to leave them soon but my entire life has been a joke and I am devastated",domesticviolence
My sisters abusive husband,"My sister has been going through years of verbal, psychological, physical abuse from her husband. It has happened over and over again for years and she has finally decided to take the step of divorcing him. 

My question is simple. How do I fuck with him? I want to put roadblocks in front of him and make life as difficult as possible for him without causing any legal issues for my sister or myself, and without jeopardizing her legal case. 

I have the means to help her with a divorce attorney and money is not an issue. I just want to know how to fuck with him and make him fall apart with stress for years to come.",domesticviolence
Not sure if my boyfriend hurt me (blackout),"my boyfriend and I went on a weekend getaway and I got more intoxicated than I'd ever been in my life (drugs + alcohol) and blacked out the night we went out. the last thing I remember is dancing with the dancers at the club and next thing I know he's waking me up, FURIOUS and grabbing me by the arm. I remember trying to tell him to relax but he was steaming mad. The next thing I know it's the next morning, I'm lying in our hotel bed with him. He's totally naked and I'm fully clothed. when he woke up I'd ordered us breakfast and put his clothes in the washer, he cursed me out for doing both of those things, fell back asleep and then claimed not to remember any of that the next time he woke up - several hours later. we stayed in that night and went home the next day which is when I noticed I had bruises on my inner thigh, underneath my arm like right above my armpit, the back of my thighs, and the side of my foot. I didn't automatically think he'd hurt me but slowly some glimpses of the night have come back into view like how angry he was that I'd fallen asleep while we were out, the way he grabbed my arm, and I remember he'd struck me once across my face while I was sleeping but he said it was playful and that he was trying to wake me up. I remember my cheek hurting badly, stinging for several minutes. I wish I could provide pictures of the bruises but I'm not sure how to do that on here.",domesticviolence
Assistance for text based safety planning question,"I am in need of assistance for safety planning via email or text. I am newly hearing impaired. I'm also a client of vocational rehabilitation and a University student.

I am in touch with my local domestic violence agency. I have not signed any contract with them yet.

Does anyone know about resources concerning text based safety planning? I contacted the deaf women's domestic violence and they seem to be regional. They also directed me to my local organization.

Does anyone know why safety planning is so difficult to do via email or text? I guess I'll start there. I understand the confidentiality issues. Has anyone ever done safety planning with a hearing-impaired survivor that has auditory processing issues due to hearing impairment, in a written form?

The reason I'm asking is that I am in urgent need of this and I am feeling like I'm bothering my local agency by asking them repeated questions. 

My therapist through the agency also told me that people don't usually fill out the forms on their own. Due to covid-19 restrictions requiring me to email the agency and not do the intake in person, I'm  concerned about sending the information about my abuser across email. Even if it is encrypted and tracked. Even if I send it through my cell phone used as a router. This is because I do not have time to check if my ex has monitored my cell phone. I have a burner phone but it is very cheap. It does not allow me to use it as a mobile hotspot. I have no way of physically getting out at the moment. Does anyone know if burner phones are still available? Can one still purchase a cell phone at Walmart/BestBuy/Target with cash? Or do contact tracing regulations cancel all of that?

Also, unfortunately due to hearing impairment I did not communicate flawlessly to my counselor or to the agency. As a result they seem to have mistakenly diagnosed me with autism. I truly love people with autism, have worked in research for 20 years, and have no discrimination against them. But I have no history of being diagnosed with such a label. I'm very concerned about this and I'm concerned about signing a contract because I'm afraid that I will be institutionalized inappropriately. I have read horror stories from Evan Stark about survivors accumulating labels and increasing their risk.
to add to my confusion, in my last session my therapist told me that the agency does not use labels, and does not write anything down, yet in my email requesting my advocate, he indicated that I had PTSD. Additionally, it was communicated in an email from the intake person that said that my therapist indicated that I had autism. All these emails were transmitted to me.

This risk of institutionalization due to mistaken incompetency is magnified for someone with a physical disability. Stating that it is the PTSD talking causing me to ask these questions does not address the confidentiality risks as well as my responsibilities to maintain confidentiality via rules. in addition I think it's relevant to mention that my abuser constantly threatens me stating that I will be institutionalized due to my disability causing me to look ""demented"" when people don't understand my hearing impairment. What tends to happen specifically is people can see that I can physically hear but I just can't understand the consonants in language anymore, especially on the phone. So phone conversations, including with my therapist, enabled me to hear 50 to 75% of what is said by the other person. In a life-threatening situation this is not constructive. I was referred to the domestic violence agency by my primary care physician and the abuse is documented in my medical records. 

I'm waiting for ear surgery and my hearing disability is well-documented. I also have captioning accommodations for my University. My abuser destroyed my captioning phone.

This well-intentioned attempt at labeling me may be because the domestic violence tactics were very severe and life-threatening, and the agency may want to protect me. But being hearing impaired running one's own business and being a full-time University student as well as holding another job does not indicate a label that could increase my risk. So I'm a little concerned and frightened and hesitant about signing any contract especially when I'm only able to communicate via the telephone that is captioned inaccurately, or via doxy me which could be a lower level of confidentiality due to the relaxation of HIPAA rules. Thank you for your consideration of my questions.",domesticviolence

Was I sexually assaulted?,"TW: Sexual assault, rape

I don’t even know where to start. I just feel like I shouldn’t be as bothered by this as I am. I’ve been raped three times in my life, as well as sex trafficked. I feel if I call rape again, people are going to just stop believing me, I’M going to stop believing me. I feel there’s only so many times you can say you were raped before people stop believing you.

To give a little bit of backstory, I have a very turbulent relationship with my parents. Last month, I (19 female) got into a huge argument with them, and my boyfriend (23, male, let’s call him Ryan) picked me up to stay with him in his basement apartment a few cities over.

I wouldn’t say my relationship with Ryan is the greatest. He is totally uncommunicative and it’s like pulling teeth trying to get him to explain his emotions towards me. He never cleans up after himself, always makes me do household chores (his laundry, his dishes, his cleaning of his room and stuff, in addition to my own chores).

I am also in school full time online (and have been for a couple weeks now) and haven’t even opened any of my courses because I’ve been so busy. 
I also have no money coming in and have to apply for Ontario Works (social assistance).
In addition to that, my grandpa was just released from the hospital on palliative care with cancer and has very little time left, but I can’t see him because I’m sick (my doctor though it was covid but it’s actually a kidney infection that could lead to kidney failure. I’m on antibiotics right now).

Ryan and I broke up about a week ago after I (very difficultly) pulled out of him that he doesn’t enjoy spending time with me and would rather spend time alone. He sleeps till 4pm, wakes up, wants alone time from me so he goes for a walk, we have dinner while he looks at cars on his phone or watches tv, then he plays video games while I clean up after him. I fall asleep around 12pm and he stays up till 4am because he “needs a bit more alone time” (his words). 

So once Ryan and I broke up last week, he decided he wanted to go back home to his town a few cities over to see his mom and his dog. He was leaving Tuesday and said I can stay till Friday at the latest in his apartment. So I was scrambling to find an apartment quickly, get on Ontario Works, try to work on school work, send email updates to my grandpa, communicate with my therapist, and clean the apartment, all with a very painful kidney infection. 

Fast forward to last night, Ryan and I decide to have some edibles because I’m in a lot of kidney pain and very stressed out. 

To give some backstory on this, I don’t do well with weed. I suffer from something called cannabis-induced psychosis (it doesn’t happen every time though). The first time I ever had marijuana, it was shatter and I severely greened out, because I had waaaay too much. I was also sexually assaulted when I greened out. I think that, along with the fact that all of my sexual assaults have involved marijuana, just fucked up my tolerance. 

I took half a caramel edible last night. One caramel was 5 mg thc/cbd balance. I split it in half so that it was only 2.5mg. That’s not a lot at all, that’s a minuscule amount. Still, less than an hour later, I was forgetting every couple of seconds where I was, absolutely mind blown that there was a wall I could lean on behind me, felt like I could feel every molecule in the sheets I was sitting on, and amazed that I could coordinate my body to get a spoonful of ice cream from my cup to my mouth. I can’t believe how high I was on so little thc and cbd. It felt like I had the whole package. 

At some point, I remember becoming so freaked out by the fact that my body could move from sitting up to lying down. I’d be lying beside Ryan and then I’d sit up, become so freaked out, and then 3 seconds later, totally forget how I got from lying down to sitting up. I remember lying face-up on my back on the bed, leaning my head against the wall, and slowly slipping into a comatose-like state.

Ryan would poke me and tickle my feet, but I wouldn’t respond to any of it. If he tried tickling me, my brain would feel it, and my body too, but I couldn’t move to react to it. I could make small movements with my hands, but they were balled up into fists and my leg muscles felt so tight. I was squeezing all my muscles and when I would actively try to relax them, they would spasm and twitch and go back to being tight. 

I was staring at the ceiling. At some point, I remember my eyes rolling into the back of my head, and then closing my eyes and becoming aware of the fact that I was breathing, and controlling my breathing. I thought that if I stopped thinking about breathing, it wouldn’t happen naturally and I’d just suffocate. 

Ryan laid down beside me and asked if I was okay. He roughly pulled my eye open with his fingers and I couldn’t see anything. It felt like my eyes were in the back of my skull. All I could do at that point was move my mouth by smiling, even if I was freaking out in my head. My outside body and smile didn’t match the inside of my body and my mind. 

Even though I could hear everything going on and feel everything at the point, I couldn’t react to it or move or speak. I felt Ryan pushing my body around. Everything was weak. My arms felt heavy and my whole body was limp. He started grabbing me and I remember him saying “you’re just like a toy doll, I can do whatever I want to you”. I remember him taking my underwear off and fucking me. I wasn’t able to move or say anything but he was manhandling me, grabbing me hard, strangling me, and at one point he pushed me over and I forcefully hit my head against the cannot beside the bed. I still didn’t react and it didn’t hurt, but I remember feeling the pressure of the hit. 

At some point, he finished, and got up to go to the bathroom. I remember still being unable to move but freaking out in my head that I needed to call someone, anyone, to ask for help. 

When I was finally able to start moving and open my eyes, I stumbled around and slowly walked around the apartment, looking for my headphones and forgetting what I was doing every couple seconds. I couldn’t really talk or communicate, except say small sentences like “I’m going walking”. 

He gave me his pocket knife and seemed genuinely worried about me going out at 3 in the morning by myself, high. I just wanted to get away to think. 

When I called a friend, she got mad at me and told me I should’ve known I couldn’t handle weed. She said “that’s what happens when you do shit like that. Bad stuff will happen”. I felt like it was all my fault and felt guilty. So I went back home (it didn’t help that I was feeling very paranoid, like someone was following me). 

I got back home and, despite feeling like I had been gone for an hour, Ryan said I was gone maybe 10-15 minutes max. I don’t really remember the rest of the night, but I’m pretty sure we went to bed shortly after that.

The next morning, I woke up and felt so shitty about myself. I remember most of what happened, and my head was killing me from the forceful hit. When Ryan woke up, I asked him if he knew why my head was hurting so much, knowing full well he wouldn’t say anything. He couldn’t give me an answer, and said maybe it was my medications causing it. 

All day, I made casual comments about my head and my eye hurting, my arms hurting as though there were bruises developing, but nothing. He wouldn’t admit anything. It was only that night that he said with a laugh “do you remember us having sex last night?”. I said no and asked him to explain what happened, but he brushed it off and changed the subject. Fast forward a day, I wake up with swelling in my eyelid where he forced it open with his (probably dirty) fingers. Over the past couple days, the swelling has been getting worse, to the point where I can barely see out of my eye while I’m writing this.

Ryan has gone back home so I’m in the apartment by myself, with a lot of anxiety.

I thought I’d write this post basically to ask if this was wrong in any way? I know it’s a stupid question but, we were kind of still together (he’s my ex but it’s complicated. We still kiss, hug, have sex), and I just feel like there’s a reasonable explanation for why he did this. I’m pretty pissed about my eye though, especially because he won’t admit that he pried open my eye with his dirty hands day’s earlier. 

I think I’m just stunned right now that someone I trusted so much could do something like this. It makes me not want to trust anyone again :(

Did anyone else’s abuser assault while you were asleep?,"After 1.5 years of being with my very recently ex partner I started to wake up to finding him having sex with me. He appeared to be asleep but lots of his behaviours didn’t add up and eventually I just believe what he said due to not being able to prove otherwise. 

He would have sex with me and I would wake up, get him off of me and then he would do a dramatic wake up usually because getting him off of me involved me kicking him in the shin due to him being literally over twice my size. After begging him to see a doctor and him telling me he was too scared to get into trouble I believed maybe it was just a sleep thing. It continued to the point in which I would wake up and be ontop and he would say that I instigated but I can’t recall at all and wasn’t in the mood ever when I woke up?

I actually went to see my doctor because I’ve been sexually abused a lot though life and I didn’t want to do something that made me very upset. Well even my doctor asked if I was sure I was instigating it and I believed what he told me was happening? 

Is this something others have experienced? I’m really torn and finding it hard to believe but at the same time it makes sense that he was just pretending due to many other behaviours he had...?",domesticviolence
boyfriend acted in a rage yesterday *trigger warning*,"Hi so i am just looking for some help/advice on my situation with my boyfriend. Last night after dinner my boyfriend called me a bitch because he thought i was having an attitude towards him and i felt very offended by that, but almost immediately our friend came to visit and we didn't have time to talk about what happened or why he felt compelled to be mean to me. So at 4am when our friend left i was trying to ask him what happened and get a sincere apology from him but he kept shutting me down saying ""i'm tired"" and very minimal bland ""sorry"". I felt extremely frustrated by him because i needed to talk it out before we went to bed.

So after about 5 minutes of this i got up and he was still ignoring me when i kept pressing him about why he can't just understand how he hurt my feelings. I (vigorously) grabbed the pillows he was laying on and threw them on the ground just to make a point, and then took his covers off so he couldn't just be sleeping (as context we were both slightly drunk and i get i was being immature at this point). So he begins to laugh at me which makes me even more mad and calls me a stupid c*nt bitch, or something along those lines. At this point i'm SO fed up so i grab his laptop and say ""i'm taking your laptop and mine"". I did this because i knew he would at least have to look at me and i thought at this point he would just concede for the moment and realize i just need a solid apology in order to go to bed.

so the moment i grab his laptop he jumps out of bed and pushes me to the ground, gets on top of me and puts his hand on my neck and is choking me (not extremely hard but like my airway was definitely restricted), he slaps my face and says ""don't you ever fucking do that again or i'm gonna fucking kill you"" 

at that moment he says ""what.... what's going on... why did i say that"" and i start screaming and run out of the house because i feared for my life. thankfully i am okay and my only injury is around my hip area where he tackled me to the floor.

If anyone has advice or has been in a similar
situation please let me know, this is someone i have been completely in love with and we have plans to get married and everything. I have never really thought this was a toxic relationship but then again i have never seen him in a rage before like this. thank you for your time everyone.",domesticviolence
Moving to a new town,"Hi all, 

I am currently in the process of moving to a new city to escape the toxic environment of the small town where I was born, raised, and my abuser lives..

To be specific as to what I need help with; transferring colleges properly (this is going alright, the counselors at this new school are helpful albeit slow reply-ers lol), getting a job, getting therapy/counseling for my PTSD, getting an apartment with no credit (I do have a college student credit card but am too scared to use it), just generally moving away from my core support system (this being my mom, cat and dog).

When will it ever be enough ?please read need help,"Hi all , 

so to sum up to events that happened me and my boyfriend have been on and off for years ... we were friends for a while, me and his family were close so i used to spend nights.. we used to mess around alot sex was amazing and i ended up pregnant with my second child. 1st born turned out wasn't his but we worked things out eventually both said  that friendships/benefits the best. 

we were careless , i ended up keeping baby and not telling him about it until 2 months before my due date. which caused hella confusion between him and his (now ex) leading him to kicked out. 

month went by we would talk here and then , he would always help me when i needed help or advice. even at my lowest point he would pick me back up. he is the most kindest , purest person you will ever meet and i was lucky to have that. waking up to him and just having  him around was the best.

but i guess that wasn't enough for me we moved in together with both kids,he stepped up to be a dad to my 1st born. we were back in a relationship again. i got caught up with texting other guys , he finds out and looses it because he loves me dearly and our family.i felt guilty i didnt need to do that.everything on my end was uncalled for. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since that day, every argument has gotten physical , from a black eye , to a swollen foot , bruises all over my face and body. i know this is all my fault i wouldnt call it domestic violence , i would call it a reaction i put this man through alot , i never understood his anger even though i would feel we would be on good terms but i would always fuck it up by doing something small like having an aditude and not commuicating things that needed to be. 

today was the last straw for it all , i have a cut on my end i bled due to an argument over nonsense like having an abortion

"I had to open up,I cant hold this inside me anymore......","So My Father is very abusive towards my mother he has really short tempers and easily gets triggered by anything my mother asks regarding work or any phone calls he shouts at her and slurs at her calling her disgusting names, we are an well  educated family but whenever he starts talking like that it seems like as if he’s got no moral or any education or he’s straight up from the slums,whenever their arguments heat up my father strikes her with anything near him, (mosquito bats,shoes,sandals) my mother has been bearing these assaults everyday 
Im 16 and during these 16 years i have seen him treat her like an animal, My mother cant even bring up a point without being hit ,His brothers are equally educated but they live a normal sane life 
But in the other hand my father’s like a maniac,He doesn’t care if she dies one day,he will still blame it on her, back in the day he was involved in shady stuff and mother was always worried and she used to ask him about his whereabouts but he wouldn’t comply and instead it would turn into an argument.
He apparently also cheats on my mother as i hear them argue over him talking to girls secretly, he denies everything and proceeds to hit her 
as i grew up i was never happy i was always broken, i was depressed , i even thought of killing myself when i was 12-13, My mother is so oppressed in her own house its just mad,its not normal My Mother is for sure depressed but she cant seek help as she’s too scared of my father , i see my friends playing with their dads like friends but i never got close with my father as im too scared and im mentally scarred,
I dont respect him but i gotta act like i do so that i dont get beaten up but he’s good dad he does provide to the family ,he buys me stuff and i got good things But that doesn’t change the fact that he’s an abuser ,
He’s over 50 and even had a cardiac arrest once but still tries to cheat on the women who sat there in the hospital all day all night praying for him but he still doesn’t respect her enough, Yes my mother is at fault too for instigating the arguments but my father is at fault too for creating the problem first of all.
I’m from Bangladesh, and what can i possibly do to help my mother? I wanted to call the police but im too scared of the consequences, i also step into their arguments and stop him from hitting her ,but for how long can i possibly do that?

"Just need to get this off my chest really, could use some advice.. My boyfriend dragged me by my hair, put his hand over my face and held me down then broke his way through a door.","We’re both working from home at the minute because of lockdown and have been getting on each other’s nerves more than usual.

But the last time we had an argument, it wasn’t even over anything important, he grabbed me and pulled me to the floor by my hair twice, covered my mouth and nose so I couldn’t breath, I bit my lip somewhere in all this so hard it was bleeding, and then he broke through the door to a locked room when I was trying to leave the situation.

I know this isn’t good and I need to leave, I haven’t been able to sleep since this has happened because all I can think about is what do I do? I feel like I have nowhere to go. We’ve been together about 4 years and we live in a house his family owns, which he doesn’t let me forget, he says it’s his house, when we argue he screams at me to leave when he knows I’ve got nowhere to go. I pay my share of the bills and do all housework because he refuses, I buy pretty much everything for the house. There are multiple holes in the walls where he has punched them in the past, I keep trying to patch them up.

When he’s finished arguing he will go back to saying how much he loves me and how he didn’t mean anything he said. 

Just after the above happened he said if he found out I told anyone what happened he would kill me. When we weren’t arguing he said he hopes I never tell anyone because in his words ‘there’d be lynch mobs going after him’ this came up after someone on Facebook invited him to like a page that was showing support for a girl who’s boyfriend had killed her .. he didn’t like that, he tried to justify what he does and says how he isn’t abusive. He was just trying to stop me screaming, or i shouldn’t have done something. 

I’ve been thinking about leaving and how I would do it but I feel like I can’t leave and rent somewhere because I have pets that’s I don’t want to leave behind, I’d have to wait until I can get enough money together anyway. should I tell someone I trust what’s happened in case it gets worse while I find somewhere else to live? What about when I do find somewhere to live, how do I tell him? Is this something I can report or have I left it too long, it’s been just over a week? I haven’t slept properly since this happened because I’m just worrying constantly.

I would like some help or insight... I feel lost,"I apologize for the long read. I haven't told anyone this but I suspect I was/am in an abusive relationship. Everything was fine the first three months but I spent a lot of time with him due to me recently having a sexual trauma and his bed was the only place I felt safe. He always told me it was fine and he was happy with me being there all the time, but there were small red flags.

He would punch the wall and get unnecessarily angry. He's had a rough childhood (experiencing neglect and I suspect he may have witnessed abuse too) so I just thought he was justified. I stopped hanging out with my friends and going out because he would make me feel bad and ignore my calls if I went out or give me the silent treatment when I came back after a night out, and he would shame me into wearing less revealing clothes. Some of the stuff that happened early on I can't remember because I think I tend to repress the arguments and verbal abuse because they happened often. Anyways, as we got closer and our relationship got older, he stopped liking me being around all the time and said he needed space. I should have complied, but it really hurt me to see a 180 from wanting me there 24/7 to not much at all. One night he went out with his friends without me and some girl kissed him (thats the story...idk what really happened and his friends are totally fine with cheating as he made me aware). After that I had trouble trusting him, but he had exhibited trust issues even before I did because within the first day of us dating he fought with me because I wouldn't let him go through my phone. I (and I know this is not ok behavior I'm not saying it is) started going through his phone after that because I felt a loss of security in our relationship and he was no longer really paying me compliments, being affectionate, expressing interest in sex, etc. I became depressed (I also suspect I have BPD and strong abandonment issues) and I told him, but he was not really supportive of me getting help or recognizing my trauma. He always thought I had no reason to be sad as I was financially comfortable and came from what appears on the outside to be a semi-normal family whereas he has struggled. We started to argue as he no longer tried to make an effort in our relationship and stopped seeming to care about me which really upset me. I really can't remember the first time he got physical with me as we used to ""play fight"" but sometimes he was a little more aggressive than I could handle (I'm a pretty small girl for reference like 100-110 pounds) but would apologize immediately after if I was hurt. Then one time he got angry in my car about something and slapped or punched me (again I think I blocked it out because all I remember was holding my face after and being hurt but with no real visible injury). After that, when he would get aggressive with me or really verbally mean I would slap him on the back almost as hard as I could (which again I feel ashamed of). Our fights became really frequent (sometimes 2-4 a week) where he would tell me to shut up or insult me and I would cry my eyes out so much that he would put a pillow over my head or cover my mouth so his roommate didn't hear me. The most escalated incident happened 2 months ago where he came home from going out with his friends and I was upset that he didn't check in on me and cuddle with me like he promised he would when he got back and I kept calling and texting him while he was in his roommates room because I was feeling anxious and depressed so I walked over to the roommates room and he (what I feel) humiliated me telling me to go away. I then went back to his room and attempted to cut myself for the first time and when I revealed to him that I did it, he told me I was psychotic and had no reason to do so, then when I cried he covered my mouth and neck with his hands, called me a dumbass, then told me he was going to sleep and didn't want to deal with my craziness. I was upset and so I shined my flashlight on him from beside the bed and he picked me up and threw me across the bed so hard it left a bruise because I hit a doorframe where my eyebrow bone is. He did not apologize or offer help after this and when I asked him for ice he screamed at me no. I kept crying until he got me ice and then when I realized it was wrong and wanted to document what happened and seek help, he took my phone, deleted the pictures, then held my phone overnight under his pillow and would not let me have it. I never sought medical attention for that and now I have headaches every day, and even though he took me on a date and told me it was an accident the next day, I still don't forgive him. I know I've engaged in some not healthy behavior probably some from my BPD such as tracking his location, going through his phone, and asking him to hang out with me instead of his friends (ones that told him it was ok to cheat on me). Do you think we're both at fault for this? He's all I have and I'm too ashamed to tell anyone what happened because they would just tell me to leave. I'm so attached to him though and even though we've broken up multiple times and gotten back together, I can't physically get myself to leave without wanting to die. What is wrong with me. If you asked me a few years ago if I thought this would ever be my life, I'd say hell no. I guess some of this is just daddy issues. Any comfort or opinions would be appreciated. Sorry again.

I also feel confused because he goes back and forth saying he doesn't love me anymore and doesn't want to be with me, to basically saying that didn't happen or he only says ""xyz"" because he's angry? I feel like I've been gaslit a lot as he's called me crazy at least 5 times and a cry baby almost every day. I know some of my behaviors were wrong, and I'm currently in therapy trying to work through my abandonment issues. But anything I ask him to do to help me he just ""can't"". Even something as simple as texting me once a day just to say hi or that he loves me. He's a terrible communicator. I hate him and I love him and I hate that I love him and that the person who makes me feel safe also makes me feel unsafe.",domesticviolence
What is wrong with me??,"My baby boy was born at 28 weeks and 1 day and weighed 1 pound and 8 ounces. He spent 89 days in the NICU where he was air lifted soon as he was born. They wanted to air lift me before I delivered so he would have been born with all the NICU staff and doctor's there but I delivered WAY to fast. He made it after a long LONG hard battle in the NICU with breathing and lung complications and heart problems he has to have surgery soon to repair a hole in his heart. He also has a umbilical hernia but that's not super important yet.  They released him 13 days ago to go home and I was completely shocked because we were told it would be June before they considered it..but at 9:00am I got a call from his nurse saying the neonatologist decided to release him with a heart monitor. 

LONG STORY SHORT I was so excited to get my baby boy home so no more traveling three hours to the hospital to see him. I went and got my boy and bring him home And my three older kids were so happy to see their brother and meet him because they haven't got to get because of the coronavirus. 

Well that night my husband got home from work and I thought he would be excited about our baby being home but NO he seemed ill and as the night went on he got so upset and I had no clue why but he started yelling at me because I had not cooked supper instead I picked up take out because I was traveling to get our son and didn't have time. He got louder and louder and he grabbed me and hit me in my left jaw and then when I failed he kicked me 3 times in my belly and the just walked off got in his truck and left. I called the police and made a report and went to hospital for evidence and safety. They caught him later that night driving drunk. 

I AM DOING EVERYTHING I CAN TO SUPPORT MY THREE CHILDREN. OLDER TWO ARE TWO YEARS OLD AND FOUR YEARS. I GOT ALL BILLS PAID BUT I HAD NO MONEY LEFT AFTER AND MY BABY NEEDS FORMULA BADLY HE HAS ENOUGH FOR ONE BOTTLE. SO THAT'S AN EMERGENCY HE IS ON ENFAMIL NUTRAMIGEN DUE TO DAIRY INTOLERANCE AND STOMACH ISSUES...AND I NEED A FEW GROCERIES FOR MY OTHER TWO BABIES WE ARE ON BARE MINIMUM BUT IM DOING EVERYTHING I CAN TO GET BY BUT IM STUCK AT LOSE..I AM CRYING SO HARD RIGHT NOW AND DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO.

WE were NOT getting food stamps because my husband made to much but I DID apply because now I can get them so I done that and just waiting on letter for phone interview. I called WIC  they gave me an appointment for next Wednesday due to they are super busy and that's all they could do. No samples or any formula my boy could drink. 

Food bank here said they had NONE 
And no friends or family can help, I asked.

The best revenge is to survive.,"It's been one whole week since he broke into my house.. I was sound asleep when I woke up to see him standing over me. He hit me with a glass bottle and strangled me. I was in and out of consciousness . I screamed loud enough for the neighbours to call the cops..He was arrested this time. The physical violence before was minor. I ignored it 

I thought I'd never hear from him again. I was wrong he's been calling me sending me texts about how I betrayed him but he still cares for me . I can't press charges against him and ruin his life. He's mentally unstable I can never blame someone for being sick. 


I accept I can't be with this man and I don't want to see him again but I love him dearly still. I don't think that will ever change. I'm looking at obtaining an injunction.

One cop pulled me aside and asked what I saw. My mom was standing there glaring at me so I said I heard screaming and that was it. I chickened out and lied.

"Male. 30. I normally wouldn't seek for advice, but I'm clueless right now.","Arms are scratched, button-up is ripped, and my ears are ringing. 

Mel got drunk and angry again. Why? my daughter decided to lift her dress up while in the house. “I will not raise her to be a whore”   
Great… I agree. It’s not great that she did that, but how she responded did not match the action.

After discipling my daughter, I consoled her. That made Mel angrier. She pulled my daughter’s hair. She got mad at me so she took it out on my daughter.   
This made me angry. I took my daughter upstairs away from Mel, and of course she followed.

Her and I clearly don’t meet eye to eye on this. We fight. She pushes my daughter because she is crying and she is mad at me. I push her and tell her never to touch her like that again.   
She got angrier. Hits me. Rips my shirt.   
I’m not defenseless. I keep pushing her back. I pull my calf muscle so I’m stuck on the bed now. She keeps punching me. I take my daughter downstairs slowly. She is hitting me and pushing me from behind. I could’ve fell while carrying my daughter. 

Downstairs she tells my daughter this is all her fault, but it somehow is also my fault. “What dadda did was wrong, but it happened because of you”. I try to stay, but she keeps kicking me while I’m just cuddling my daughter. She says she wants to stay with my daughter but doesn’t want me around. I guess I’m babying her… Also she keeps telling my daughter this is all my fault and saying that “Whatever Dad says is a lie”. This is so infuriating... Do I step down to her level? She takes my daughter back upstairs and tells me not to come up. I comply because I can’t really walk. Of course she comes back down by herself 2 minutes later. This was never about wanting to spend time with my daughter.

She leaves me alone for 20 minutes and then comes over. She tries to say this is all my fault. I tell her I don’t want to talk to her. “Right now, I find you disgusting” I tell her. After letting me know that I just ruined my daughter's life because she now thinks it’s okay for men to push women, she tells me one day she is going to stab me. She is only with me to make my life miserable… her actual words. She says I’m faking my calf injury and is insisting on taking a look at it. I tell her to not touch me. She gets mad and tries to hit me. Scratches me and bites once again.

The police are useless even with a court order.,"Currently there’s a protection order - because he beat one of us up two weeks ago and another of us ended up in hospital. But he’s been calling over and over (around 15 times just today), making threats and intimidating, calling work, making up stories about us to other people. When we called the police to report that he’d broken the court order - they downplayed it and tried to make out like it was nothing or that there was nothing they could do.

What is the point of having a protection order in place if he can break it with no consequence. And because he can break it with no consequence, he acts like he’s in the right. “Well if it was wrong the police would have done something by now”

I don't know what to do to help my mom. Any tips?,"I am adult daughter to my parents and in this case my mother is the one being abused. My 5 siblings and I were originally living at home until the past 2 years, when everyone grew too tired of the situation at home. Most of them have cut off contact with my father and only text or call my mom once a week or every other week.

Last month my mother caught my father cheating and kicked him out of the home. He didn't really care and left. My mother is financially independent, has good health, and family support. We got her private counseling so that she would not take him back (this is not the first time he cheats and he had been yelling at her so we didn't want it to escalate).

She had been doing well until her session. I don't know what exactly the counselor said to her but she told me it was along the lines of ""everyone deserves a second chance and it's all fixable"". Lo and behold she kept visiting him at the place he's staying at, cooking for him, and buying him supplies. Two days ago he beat her up. She refused to report any of this to law enforcement. He told her after that that he wants to work things out.

Like I said I'm an adult and financially independent too. I am currently living with my mother mostly because we have space available here and I wanted to physically be here for her. I had already told her that I couldn't stand seeing her do this to herself because it's too emotionally taxing for me to stay if she does not plan to change things. At times, it feels like this whole thing hurts me more than it hurts her because she's so blase about it. I can't put her wellbeing over my own.

I'm already in the process of moving to a new job halfway across the country. But I figured a last ditch effort might be what she needs. I love her to death, but she's my parent, not my child. I can't continue on this road constantly feeling responsible for what happens to her.

Does anyone know of any counseling or therapy resources that might actually help her? At this point, I'm at a loss of how to help her. I'm sure she'll take him back home once I'm not physically here to prevent it from happening but if I could at least give her some resources before then, it could make a difference. Maybe at least let me know what the final straw was for you, if it was anything you were told by a family member or friend? I want to make a difference.",domesticviolence
Staying for the kids,"Hello everyone! I'm a CPS worker and I thought I'd just post some info here regarding some things I've seen in my line of work in reference to domestic violence. I hope it doesn't come across as guilt-tripping as that's not my intention at all. I only want whoever needs it to see the other side of the story from the child's perspective. I mostly work with female victims while my male coworkers work with male victims so most of this will be regarding mother victims as it's what I have experience with.

At work, a lot of the time when talking to the victim I am told that they stay for the kids, because they feel like the children will benefit from having two parents instead of one or because they feel like a big life change (divorce) might be detrimental to the children. And so I am here to talk about specifically that.

We get a lot of calls from schools in which young kids can't concentrate in school because they're worried about their mother and whether or not she's alive because parents fought the day before and dad said he was going to kill mom.

We get other calls in which a teen ends up in jail for harming or killing his father to defend their mother. Sometimes, when kids can't intervene, they end up feeling guilty for not being able to change things, even though it's not their responsibility.

All of this takes a toll. 99% of these kids have told me they were much happier after leaving the home or would have wished the victim parent could've left.

Personally, I have taken victims for restraining orders, accompanied them to court, found them a hotel or home to stay in, and even accompanied them to change the locks on the door. This doesn't happen for every worker, but there's some good ones out there.

So no, leaving is not detrimental to them. Witnessing abuse is what is largely psychologically impacting. And on that note, they don't have to be in the same room with the victim and abuser for them to be affected. Walls are thin. Even if they were out of the home at the time of the abuse, they might get home and see marks or bruises on the victim. Or even see the victim in a bad emotional state.

Please don't use your child as a reason. It puts stress on them and when they grow up, they can feel responsible for making you stay.

Hope this was informational!",domesticviolence

Please help- trial,"Please help-Trial

To make a long story short, I was abused physically/sexually/emotionally long term by my husband. There is a lot of evidence of this thanks to a therapist who was excellent at documentation and recommendations to keep me as safe as possible until I was hopefully no longer brainwashed enough to stay. However, before I ever reached this point, cops were called by a witness, and there is a huge pending trial post-stay at home order that has been continued for over a year. 

I am extremely fearful for my life. As trial approaches, my anxiety is insurmountable. I don’t want to look at him, though I’m sure I will be asked. I’ve been told by my attorneys that his (expensive) attorney is known to be brutal and preys on the abuser-victim dynamic/mentality to win their case. 

Last night I stupidly ventured into our old messages. I wanted to know if I was better, or if his words could still make me believe I deserved every beating, unforgivable comments, etc. 

When he thought I had reason to call the cops or when I said his physical violence upset me, he would later text me that I beat him. Even though I’ve never laid a hand on anyone in my life. I only ever ducked and covered, I was never able to fight back. I completely froze in every incident. 

I am terrified as he was so calculated and the jury or judge will favor him because of his attempts to cover his tracks. Despite audio evidence of him admitting to abusing me. During which, when I would remind him abuse is illegal and he could lose his military job, he would say “you beat me I don’t know what you’re talking about”. 

Will a jury understand that manipulation is part of the abuse I endured or will I be torn apart on the stand in attempt to protect myself/others from him? 

I am utterly petrified. I am on the verge of a panic attack just thinking about trial which is a considerable amount of time away. I’ve read that to a judge or jury, anxiety behaviors such as fidgeting, looking down, etc. can make you look dishonest but being in the same room with him or seeing his face could throw me into flight or fight mode and I’m afraid I will not be able to appear any more brave, put together, or sincere. 

I feel as if I “lose” no matter the outcome. I convicted, he warned me he would ruin my life, kill me, etc. if this affected his job, family, what have you. On the other hand, he is so calculated I fear no one would ever believe me no matter how many photos, videos, etc. I had. 

There is also the fact that it’s been postponed for so long, details have become fuzzy and I am afraid if my memory doesn’t serve me perfectly and consistently, my testimony will be irrelevant despite the hours of trauma I will revisit and yet again, endure. 

Anyone with advice about getting through this, or experience with bench trials, ideas for coping skills before/during the trial, etc. are extremely appreciated.",domesticviolence
"If your significant other throws objects at you out of anger, is one time too many?","-Does it matter if your SO missed you?

-Does it matter that the objects probably would not have hurt you?

-Why would you give your SO another chance?

-Would you tell anyone about your SO’s behavior, like their family? (Other than law enforcement).

I originally posted this in r/relationships but it was removed by moderators to avoid trolling. 

Background: I am interested in everyone’s perspective based on a recent event in my life. My girlfriend (27F) threw objects at me (28M) out of anger after I told her I did not see a future with her based on her emotionally abusive behavior (we have had this conversation before).  She missed, and they weren’t things that necessarily would have hurt me or caused significant damage. She stopped throwing things after I threatened to call the police. 

To add, the conversation preceding this revolved around her trying to convince me to move back and how I was not comfortable doing so. 

We separated earlier this year, and she has since attended therapy. She believes attending therapy for a few months should be enough for me to return to live with her, and that I have to live with her to see how she has changed. 

She has never done this before, but has had issues in the past controlling her anger. She was somewhat apologetic after the incident, but said it was both of our faults and one of us should have de-escalated the situation.  (I don’t buy it)

Frankly, prior to the incident I was not comfortable returning to live with her. Now, I’m not quite sure if I even want to *see* her again, let alone share a living space. 

And in case anyone is wondering, I have *never* thrown anything at her out of anger. Her behavior was not an act of self-defense. 

Of course, I love her and hope she gets better. That’s why this has been difficult for me.

My wife hit me in the back with a glass bottle and grabbed me by the neck,"So my wife and I (46M) got into an argument about whether the kids had to turn off video games by midnight. We disagreed and it was getting heated so I said I wanted to leave and we could talk when people were more calm. My 17M son wouldn’t let me leave the room. I tried to get by and he started shoving me. I forcibly moved him out of the way and was walking to my room when my wife hit me in the back with a glass bottle. I asked her to just let me go and let’s calm down. She grabbed me by the neck. I started to film her and she immediately let go. 

A little background: I’ve had a really bad last few years. I was laid off and unemployed. I became seriously depressed and tried antidepressant medication as well as psilocybin mushrooms. I have been quite upset and angry at moments. It was probably emotionally abusive. I have been seeing a therapist. My wife went twice but she stopped saying the problems are mine. I still go. 

I don’t know what to do. I told my wife it was not ok but she said she should have hit me harder because I deserved it and that I’m a big ninny. Never in my marriage (almost 20 years) have either of us gotten physical. I don’t know what to do. Should I take the children and separate for a bit? Do I call the police?  Do we try to just negotiate this? Four hours later and she is still not apologetic and says I deserved it. I love her so much. I know I put her through a tough time with my depression and I know she’s exhausted and stressed. But physical violence (while all my children were watching) really scares me.",domesticviolence
How to deal with situation where I am stuck living with abusive ex who won't leave?,"I don't know why it is like this. I am going to refer to my ex as M.

&amp;#x200B;

I broke up with M at the beginning of this year and several trying years of trying to break it off and being taken seriously (6 years regretfully together). For much of the relationship, we had a dead bedroom. When I would threaten break up and talk about how I was suffering, suddenly my complaints would be addressed, but maybe just for that day or few days. We'd have sex and M would finally do the chores (or pay his long awaited month's rest -- just for that month's rent -- after on and off months of him not paying). However, other times when I tried to force a breakup, M would have a suicidal breakdown and then I would freak out. M would also ignore and tell me that we not broken up even if we discussed it. This time, however, things were different. M finally agreed to a break up and agreed to be out by March (we are both on the lease). Well, March passed, then April, and now May. They have only managed to save up $1200 within that time as they have told me that they blew it on drugs and video games (and I know other things).

They agreed to end of July, but when I brought it up today they said that they ""hoped"" to move out by then. I then suggested that they could have the apartment as it would allow for them not to have to pay many of the fees and deposits. They got incredibly upset, told me they couldn't afford them, and that my goal was to financially ruin them since they felt the apartment @ $1200/month (not including utilities) was too expensive for them (they make the same amount as me, but purchased a used luxury car, ran up credit, and have student loans). I told them that I just wanted to separate and that I had hoped that by them having the apartment, it would be easier on them. They could then pay the remaining 5 months and go elsewhere, if they'd like. During that discussion, they began giving me the silent treatment and wouldn't even look at me. After several hours, they then came back and said that they would agree to keep the apartment if they could do so at the end of July and I told M that that would defeat the purpose.

Even more hours later, they calmed down, and started acting affectionate. I have been stuck in quarantine with them for the last two months. I go out just to the store and see no one else. I have been going to Zoom meetups and trying to call friends, but am so incredibly lonely and miss the in-person connection. I finished school recently, so I have less to occupy myself with and distract me from the loneliness. I feel like, despite being broken-up and 100% wanting M to move-out, it's hard not to be friendly and affectionate. I am lonely and I just want someone I can talk to and curl up next to. It's so stupid. When I am greyrocking, they take away my personal items like my phone and computer (even made like they were going to destroy my computer), scream at me, kick things, and so on.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no place to escape to as they are able and do unlock all of the doors that I try to hide behind. It's at such a hot, unsafe temperature that it isn't safe to just take a walk outside and none of my friends live close to me. I am never given any privacy and when M starts a fight, M will continuously badger me until I scream at them or react. Then, they will smirk and tell me I am the abuser.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do.  I am tired of being screamed at, belittled, having slurs thrown at me, lied to, left to a dirty house, and without privacy. What are my best courses of action? They have said they will sue me if I try to move-out. I have been journaling the events, but I feel like this whole thing is hopeless. I hate that I still seek attention and affection, too. I feel so disgusted with myself. I also feel like M jumps between hot and cold to punish me and demonstrate that they have control in the relationship. Is this why abuser will seem really angry and/or distant one moment, super affectionate the next, and then angry/belittling?",domesticviolence
App idea?,"Hi all,

I have a few questions I was hoping you might be able to provide me!

I just want to start by saying that this is (barely) an app idea but I wanted to check if it was worth it for victims. I'll briefly explain what I've thought of so far...

Firstly I presume that there is a lot of surveillance in these situations and was wondering how far does it go. E.g. social media for example.
I thought that for safety's sake having a skin (for example a duplication of some boring app like calculator) that can be only removed with a password
- is this likely to work? Do you think that person will notice a duplication of an app they don't use often?

Secondly the app itself... I was going to try and see to make it more of a ""collection of evidence"" so when that person manages to break the cycle they have the proof, I've seen a few posts about the police's limitations/lack of interest and I thought perhaps this would help? So things I thought you could store in here
- photos (not accessible from gallery) or videos/voice recordings, maybe pdfs of any hospital visits that would record this?
- a diary of some sort, either for your own use or to note attacks/incidences
- if possible some sort of secret bank account, but I can see some limitations of this happening due to potential surveillance on bank statements. 
- resources/advice 

Any comments on what I have listed or further ideas? 

Thanks everyone, stay safe xx",domesticviolence
How do my mom and I escape my emotionally abusive father?,"My alcoholic father has been verbally, emotionally, and mentally abusive for over 16 years. It’s gotten worse over the years and he recently threatened physical violence against my mother. He also keeps asking her where the guns are in the house, and has threatened to kill her and himself on a few occasions. 

It’s not as extreme as many other abuse cases, but I’ve self-harmed for 6 years now due to it and my mother is severely depressed. We feel trapped. We have no where to go. I’m 16 and she’s 45. We have two cats and 4 dogs, so living with a nearby relative wouldn’t be an option. 

I’m disabled and need constant medical treatment, so that’s another issue. We don’t know what to do. I have one brother and one sister. My brother is 19 and lives with us but he’s an EMT and is rarely home. My sister no longer lives with us. Living with her isn’t an option as she lives in an apartment.",domesticviolence

My parents act completely normal with other people and I feel ungrateful.,"I (23F) still live with my parents (53M, 45F). I wish I had the opportunity to leave the house way before, but I couldn't live alone since I had seizures on a daily basis. Now I feel better and with a change of medication I have gone from several seizures a day to absolutely no seizures.

My parents are extremely traditional. Traditional, overprotective and maybe... abusive? I still feel guilty calling them abusive. Why? They are extremely protective and worried about my health. When I was at the hospital they were very caring. Nurses and doctors told me ""You have a very supportive and loving family, unlike most people we see on a regular basis unfortunately"".  When I was ill, my mother would come everyday even at night (even when she was not on holidays), and all I could do at the time was complaining about my health issue and crying a lot. My dad would bring me nice food almost everyday because the hospital food was not so great as you would expect. Even friends and extended family find my parents ""overprotective"" but adorable and extremely loving.

**However, I still don't understand most of their behavior :**

\- When I was younger my parents would argue everyday at night, I would hear them throwing dishes against the wall, yelling in another room, slamming doors... I was confused and scared. I was also scared for my mother, I thought that my dad would be able to kill my mother if he wanted to. Once my dad went absolutely furious because of my mother's ""manipulative and disrespectful behavior"" and he made violent threats. It was terrible for my siblings and we had to leave the house with my mother for a few hours, just in case.

I have tried several times to talk about these events to my mother years later and she told me ""he's just furious at the moment but two hours later he forgets about it"". That's true. And to be fair he is not always like that. Most of the time he's just very kind and funny. But he completely has anger issues with me and my mother. My other siblings do everything to please him so he never really has any issues with them, I was always the ""rebel"" one according to both of my parents because I have some insight about their behavior and yes I do have a ... controversial temperament, I am the only one among my siblings. Otherwise every single person I have met see me as extremely polite and not an argumentative person.

But... yesterday, many years later... he did exactly the same thing with me. I was wearing a beanie in hot weather because I didn't have time to blow dry my hair properly. I know that it's not the right time to wear a beanie but I don't think I caused him prejudice by wearing my beanie. He went completely furious, yelled in front of me and said ""Now just SHUT UP or I am going to humiliate you in front of everyone in the street and in public places"", which he almost did in front of someone before I left and cry.

I told my mother about what happened, she said I was ""oversensitive"", and that this event was ""created by my own imagination"", ""you know I have always known that you were extremely creative, even as a child"", (I must admit that I was extremely sensitive as a child but I would never lie or make false statements about events which truly happened and I don't have any history of pathological lying). Once she even said that I was ""oversensitive"" and ""giving to much importance to bad people"" when I tried to confess about things that happened to me in school, such as extreme bullying including repeated rape threats.

**Another event :**

I cannot date anyone besides the context of marriage, so when my parents learnt that I was dating someone (I was 17) and lied for the first time about seeing a female friend instead of my boyfriend they also went furious, started to beat me, bite me, pulled my hair. It was **extremely violent**. They called me names ""slut"", ""shame to the family"", ""in our family dating without marriage is FORBIDDEN every woman here knows that, you're the only one, you don't respect your own father"" They also locked me in a room, took my mobile phone and more, I couldn't even call the cops. But several years later this even was completely forgotten. I believe that the reason why they stopped being so mean with me is that they knew I would speak against them to other family members. And I have decided to forgive them for that event. I was too kind. The beanie event was way too much.

&amp;#x200B;

**Other events**

\- Trying to make me feel like a ""spoiled child"" for having food and water. I had to take extremely cold showers for years because my parents just didn't care at all about it. The only time I was ""spoiled"" (I wasn't *really* spoiled but they cared about me) was after being in the emergency room at the hospital, so it was way later.  But despite that I still think my parents worked hard for me for me and my siblings.

\- My mother was calling me names as a child

\- When my grades were not good enough, I was beaten and yelled at, **because most of the time** I had excellent grades, **except when I was ill and bullied**

\- Cannot leave the house alone or even with friends in the evening and at night, my father has to be there to drive me at the place. ""For my own safety"", ""to avoid getting raped or murdered"".

**What I want to do now**

Leave in a few months ""for my studies"" officially, because I am done living with them exactly. I might have an apartment after summer. I am not even doing therapy for two reasons.  I have a bad experience with a therapist who couldn't admit that the issue was more than ""overprotective parenting"" and I want to save money for the next few months. If they won't let me leave (I don't want to have the police involved) I will have to go on my own without them noticing the day I leave, just with a backpack. Since I won't have anyone in my family to help me with the apartment moving stuff, I am probably going to leave a lot of belongings in my parents' house. Since I might cut contact with them if things don't turn well it will probably be lost. But my safety and well-being are more important and I realize I have been in denial my whole life.

But now I feel completely lost. My entire life has been a lie : my ""parents"" are not the ""kind"" people I thought they were and I don't feel safe anymore. I want to stop confessing stuff to my mother because she makes me feel like a complete ungrateful liar, which I am not. And when I talk to other people about my parents, either they think I am overreacting because ""it's obvious that they love me despite all the bad stuff"", either they believe me but think I just have to ""disobey"", ""you're an adult after all"". Yes, an adult, but terrified of my own parents and their reactions.

Tl;dr: I feel completely ungrateful for calling my parents ""abusive"" (when they can actually be violent, for innocent things like dating or wearing a beanie in hot weather, which can be seen as a lack of respect in my parents' eyes), because they make me feel like a spoiled person for having access to decent housing and food. I want to leave them soon but my entire life has been a joke and I am devastated",domesticviolence

“Me too” for Domestic Violence?,"So about a year ago was the last attack from my ex boyfriend. He gave me a black eye (my second one) and punched me in my back several times. I have not seen him since. I have struggled to cope and heal from the aftermath of that relationship. I am good friends with his sister (was for years before our relationship) and am very close to his family. All of them have encouraged me to press charges in the past but I’m only now feeling ready. I’m located in Illinois and not sure of the law here regarding time limit with this kind of thing. Obviously will speak to a lawyer but wanted to get some input here first if anyone has any information. Anyway, my ex hit me many times and I have pictures of the 2 black eyes he gave me, but no proof of any of the other attacks. I am friends with his son’s mother who also says she was abused by him when she was with him and has given me an eerily similar description of what their relationship was like. She never pressed charges either. I recently also came into contact with another ex girlfriend of his who he used to abuse - he actually broke her ribs on the last attack. I am aware of other women he has dated and used and abused as well. He is a serial abuser and I believe he needs to be held accountable for his actions, no matter how long ago they were. I also believe he will hurt someone else and am afraid he will go too far one day. I’m wondering if anyone has any information that could help me in this situation? Is there a timeline for when you can report or press charges for physical assault? Would all of the women have to file a police report in order for their stories to matter? What is the best way to go about this ?

*I hope someone takes the time to read this. I could really use advice* I should hate him. Why do I feel guilty for planning to finally leave him?,"I'm having a hard time sorting out my thoughts about everything. My boyfriend was recently arrested for the 3rd time for assaulting me. This time he was charged with strangling me, and with child endangerment for doing so in front of our 5 year old. We've been together for 8 years. He popped my elbow out of place the first time he was arrested about 7 years ago. I had to go to the hospital that time and have my arm in asing for several weeks. The 2nd time,  3 years ago,  he punched me in the face multiple times, then grabbed our daughter and took off in the vehicle with her. We had to convince him he wouldn't be arrested to get her brought back safely. He ended up going to rehab that time for 6 months, but was relapsing soon after getting back home and it wasn't long before he was being violent again. The times he's physically abused me are too many to count. He's held me in a room with a knife to my throat threatening to kill me and screaming at me for 2 hours. He's slammed my head into the back of the ceramic toilet so hard that my vision went black and I thought I was going to die. He held a machete to my throat a few months ago and threatened to kill me again. He's choked me so hard that I couldn't breathe and hand handprints on my throat at least 5 to times. There's so much more. Typing this stuff brings up feelings of resentment, hopelessness, anger, fear, I literally have tears in my eyes thinking about it. But I'm still struggling to make the decision to leave. I have an opportunity to finally leave because he was put in jail and is now in rehab. I need to go before his 28 day rehab stay is over. But, for some reason the rehab is allowing him to call me repeatedly, at least 3 times a day; and it's really hard on me. He's not even legally supposed to be contacting me. But no one is monitoring him when he's on the phone. And I can't call and say anything to the staff. It's a really horrible situation. My daughter and I are still in his house, which his parents own. They come over here constantly. They want to make sure I'm around for him to support him in rehab and to make sure he gets his life together when he gets out. They keep telling me he deserves another chance. It's so ridiculous. It really hurts me. I've had to call his parents or go to their house many times with my daughter because of his violence. They always bring me right back here to him. One time I ran out of the house and took his vehicle and drove to their house after he had punched me so bad that my eye had swollen shut. My daughter had spent the night at their house the night before and was already there. They brought my daughter and I home to him less than 2 hours later. I have to get away from here. I know this short rehab stay won't help him. I want to do what's best for my daughter and I. I've been controlled by him, and his family, for so long and I'm scared. I'm scared to make my own decisions. I feel so unsure of myself. I just want to raise my daughter in a stable and healthy environment. I hope I'm doing the right thing. I don't think he deserves any more chances. I've been afraid he was going to kill me so many times. This is my only shot. I hope I find the strength to do what's right.",domesticviolence

2. What are some of the things that your abuser has done to you?

3.  Are you male or female, how has this affected your reaction to the abuse?

4. How old are you/how old were you when you were abused?

5. What effect has the abuse had on your life? Has it left you with traumas, PTSD, anxiety, depression, night terrors etc. ? Were you able to let it go? How has it affected future relationships, or your future in general?

6. How has the abuse affected your friends and family and your relationship with them?

7. How did your abuser justify their behaviour, what were their excuses?

8. What are some traits of an abuser, how do they act? How do you recognize abusers, how did you realise you were being abused?


9. Where do you live and how does your country punish abusers?

After discipling my daughter, I consoled her. That made Mel angrier. She pulled my daughter’s hair. She got mad at me so she took it out on my daughter.   
This made me angry. I took my daughter upstairs away from Mel, and of course she followed.

The police are useless even with a court order.,"Currently there’s a protection order - because he beat one of us up two weeks ago and another of us ended up in hospital.

When we called the police to report that he’d broken the court order - they downplayed it and tried to make out like it was nothing or that there was nothing they could do.

What is the point of having a protection order in place if he can break it with no consequence. And because he can break it with no consequence, he acts like he’s in the right. “Well if it was wrong the police would have done something by now”

I don't know what to do to help my mom. Any tips?,"I am adult daughter to my parents and in this case my mother is the one being abused. My 5 siblings and I were originally living at home until the past 2 years, when everyone grew too tired of the situation at home. Most of them have cut off contact with my father and only text or call my mom once a week or every other week.

Last month my mother caught my father cheating and kicked him out of the home. He didn't really care and left. My mother is financially independent, has good health, and family support. We got her private counseling so that she would not take him back (this is not the first time he cheats and he had been yelling at her so we didn't want it to escalate).

She had been doing well until her session. I don't know what exactly the counselor said to her but she told me it was along the lines of ""everyone deserves a second chance and it's all fixable"". Lo and behold she kept visiting him at the place he's staying at, cooking for him, and buying him supplies. Two days ago he beat her up. She refused to report any of this to law enforcement. He told her after that that he wants to work things out.

Like I said I'm an adult and financially independent too. I am currently living with my mother mostly because we have space available here and I wanted to physically be here for her. I had already told her that I couldn't stand seeing her do this to herself because it's too emotionally taxing for me to stay if she does not plan to change things. At times, it feels like this whole thing hurts me more than it hurts her because she's so blase about it. I can't put her wellbeing over my own.

I'm already in the process of moving to a new job halfway across the country. But I figured a last ditch effort might be what she needs. I love her to death, but she's my parent, not my child. I can't continue on this road constantly feeling responsible for what happens to her.

Does anyone know of any counseling or therapy resources that might actually help her? At this point, I'm at a loss of how to help her.

Staying for the kids,"Hello everyone! I'm a CPS worker and I thought I'd just post some info here regarding some things I've seen in my line of work in reference to domestic violence. I hope it doesn't come across as guilt-tripping as that's not my intention at all. I only want whoever needs it to see the other side of the story from the child's perspective. I mostly work with female victims while my male coworkers work with male victims so most of this will be regarding mother victims as it's what I have experience with.

At work, a lot of the time when talking to the victim I am told that they stay for the kids, because they feel like the children will benefit from having two parents instead of one or because they feel like a big life change (divorce) might be detrimental to the children. And so I am here to talk about specifically that.

We get a lot of calls from schools in which young kids can't concentrate in school because they're worried about their mother and whether or not she's alive because parents fought the day before and dad said he was going to kill mom.

We get other calls in which a teen ends up in jail for harming or killing his father to defend their mother. Sometimes, when kids can't intervene, they end up feeling guilty for not being able to change things, even though it's not their responsibility.

All of this takes a toll. 99% of these kids have told me they were much happier after leaving the home or would have wished the victim parent could've left.

Personally, I have taken victims for restraining orders, accompanied them to court, found them a hotel or home to stay in, and even accompanied them to change the locks on the door. This doesn't happen for every worker, but there's some good ones out there.

So no, leaving is not detrimental to them. Witnessing abuse is what is largely psychologically impacting. And on that note, they don't have to be in the same room with the victim and abuser for them to be affected. Walls are thin. Even if they were out of the home at the time of the abuse, they might get home and see marks or bruises on the victim. Or even see the victim in a bad emotional state.

Please don't use your child as a reason. It puts stress on them and when they grow up, they can feel responsible for making you stay.

Hope this was informational!",domesticviolence

Please help- trial,"Please help-Trial

To make a long story short, I was abused physically/sexually/emotionally long term by my husband. There is a lot of evidence of this thanks to a therapist who was excellent at documentation and recommendations to keep me as safe as possible until I was hopefully no longer brainwashed enough to stay. However, before I ever reached this point, cops were called by a witness, and there is a huge pending trial post-stay at home order that has been continued for over a year. 

I am extremely fearful for my life. As trial approaches, my anxiety is insurmountable. I don’t want to look at him, though I’m sure I will be asked. I’ve been told by my attorneys that his (expensive) attorney is known to be brutal and preys on the abuser-victim dynamic/mentality to win their case. 

Last night I stupidly ventured into our old messages. I wanted to know if I was better, or if his words could still make me believe I deserved every beating, unforgivable comments, etc. 

When he thought I had reason to call the cops or when I said his physical violence upset me, he would later text me that I beat him. Even though I’ve never laid a hand on anyone in my life. I only ever ducked and covered, I was never able to fight back. I completely froze in every incident. 

I am terrified as he was so calculated and the jury or judge will favor him because of his attempts to cover his tracks. Despite audio evidence of him admitting to abusing me. During which, when I would remind him abuse is illegal and he could lose his military job, he would say “you beat me I don’t know what you’re talking about”. 

Will a jury understand that manipulation is part of the abuse I endured or will I be torn apart on the stand in attempt to protect myself/others from him? 

I am utterly petrified. I am on the verge of a panic attack just thinking about trial which is a considerable amount of time away. I’ve read that to a judge or jury, anxiety behaviors such as fidgeting, looking down, etc. can make you look dishonest but being in the same room with him or seeing his face could throw me into flight or fight mode and I’m afraid I will not be able to appear any more brave, put together, or sincere. 

I feel as if I “lose” no matter the outcome. I convicted, he warned me he would ruin my life, kill me, etc. if this affected his job, family, what have you. On the other hand, he is so calculated I fear no one would ever believe me no matter how many photos, videos, etc. I had. 

There is also the fact that it’s been postponed for so long, details have become fuzzy and I am afraid if my memory doesn’t serve me perfectly and consistently, my testimony will be irrelevant despite the hours of trauma I will revisit and yet again, endure. 

Anyone with advice about getting through this, or experience with bench trials, ideas for coping skills before/during the trial, etc. are extremely appreciated.",domesticviolence
"If your significant other throws objects at you out of anger, is one time too many?","-Does it matter if your SO missed you?

-Does it matter that the objects probably would not have hurt you?

-Why would you give your SO another chance?

-Would you tell anyone about your SO’s behavior, like their family? (Other than law enforcement).

I originally posted this in r/relationships but it was removed by moderators to avoid trolling. 

Background: I am interested in everyone’s perspective based on a recent event in my life. My girlfriend (27F) threw objects at me (28M) out of anger after I told her I did not see a future with her based on her emotionally abusive behavior (we have had this conversation before).  She missed, and they weren’t things that necessarily would have hurt me or caused significant damage. She stopped throwing things after I threatened to call the police. 

To add, the conversation preceding this revolved around her trying to convince me to move back and how I was not comfortable doing so. 

We separated earlier this year, and she has since attended therapy. She believes attending therapy for a few months should be enough for me to return to live with her, and that I have to live with her to see how she has changed. 

She has never done this before, but has had issues in the past controlling her anger. She was somewhat apologetic after the incident, but said it was both of our faults and one of us should have de-escalated the situation.  (I don’t buy it)

Frankly, prior to the incident I was not comfortable returning to live with her. Now, I’m not quite sure if I even want to *see* her again, let alone share a living space. 

And in case anyone is wondering, I have *never* thrown anything at her out of anger. Her behavior was not an act of self-defense. 

Of course, I love her and hope she gets better. That’s why this has been difficult for me.

TL;DR: Estranged girlfriend threw things at me out of anger. I didn’t get hurt (she missed), she is a little apologetic. If your significant other throws things at you out of anger, is one time too many?",domesticviolence
My wife hit me in the back with a glass bottle and grabbed me by the neck,"So my wife and I (46M) got into an argument about whether the kids had to turn off video games by midnight. We disagreed and it was getting heated so I said I wanted to leave and we could talk when people were more calm. My 17M son wouldn’t let me leave the room. I tried to get by and he started shoving me. I forcibly moved him out of the way and was walking to my room when my wife hit me in the back with a glass bottle. I asked her to just let me go and let’s calm down. She grabbed me by the neck. I started to film her and she immediately let go. 

A little background: I’ve had a really bad last few years. I was laid off and unemployed. I became seriously depressed and tried antidepressant medication as well as psilocybin mushrooms. I have been quite upset and angry at moments. It was probably emotionally abusive. I have been seeing a therapist. My wife went twice but she stopped saying the problems are mine. I still go. 

I don’t know what to do. I told my wife it was not ok but she said she should have hit me harder because I deserved it and that I’m a big ninny. Never in my marriage (almost 20 years) have either of us gotten physical. I don’t know what to do. Should I take the children and separate for a bit? Do I call the police?  Do we try to just negotiate this? Four hours later and she is still not apologetic and says I deserved it. I love her so much. I know I put her through a tough time with my depression and I know she’s exhausted and stressed. But physical violence (while all my children were watching) really scares me.",domesticviolence
How to deal with situation where I am stuck living with abusive ex who won't leave?,"I don't know why it is like this. I am going to refer to my ex as M.

&amp;#x200B;

I broke up with M at the beginning of this year and several trying years of trying to break it off and being taken seriously (6 years regretfully together). For much of the relationship, we had a dead bedroom. When I would threaten break up and talk about how I was suffering, suddenly my complaints would be addressed, but maybe just for that day or few days. We'd have sex and M would finally do the chores (or pay his long awaited month's rest -- just for that month's rent -- after on and off months of him not paying). However, other times when I tried to force a breakup, M would have a suicidal breakdown and then I would freak out. M would also ignore and tell me that we not broken up even if we discussed it. This time, however, things were different. M finally agreed to a break up and agreed to be out by March (we are both on the lease). Well, March passed, then April, and now May. They have only managed to save up $1200 within that time as they have told me that they blew it on drugs and video games (and I know other things).

They agreed to end of July, but when I brought it up today they said that they ""hoped"" to move out by then. I then suggested that they could have the apartment as it would allow for them not to have to pay many of the fees and deposits. They got incredibly upset, told me they couldn't afford them, and that my goal was to financially ruin them since they felt the apartment @ $1200/month (not including utilities) was too expensive for them (they make the same amount as me, but purchased a used luxury car, ran up credit, and have student loans). I told them that I just wanted to separate and that I had hoped that by them having the apartment, it would be easier on them. They could then pay the remaining 5 months and go elsewhere, if they'd like. During that discussion, they began giving me the silent treatment and wouldn't even look at me. After several hours, they then came back and said that they would agree to keep the apartment if they could do so at the end of July and I told M that that would defeat the purpose.

Even more hours later, they calmed down, and started acting affectionate. I have been stuck in quarantine with them for the last two months. I go out just to the store and see no one else. I have been going to Zoom meetups and trying to call friends, but am so incredibly lonely and miss the in-person connection. I finished school recently, so I have less to occupy myself with and distract me from the loneliness. I feel like, despite being broken-up and 100% wanting M to move-out, it's hard not to be friendly and affectionate. I am lonely and I just want someone I can talk to and curl up next to. It's so stupid. When I am greyrocking, they take away my personal items like my phone and computer (even made like they were going to destroy my computer), scream at me, kick things, and so on.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no place to escape to as they are able and do unlock all of the doors that I try to hide behind. It's at such a hot, unsafe temperature that it isn't safe to just take a walk outside and none of my friends live close to me. I am never given any privacy and when M starts a fight, M will continuously badger me until I scream at them or react. Then, they will smirk and tell me I am the abuser.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do.  I am tired of being screamed at, belittled, having slurs thrown at me, lied to, left to a dirty house, and without privacy. What are my best courses of action? They have said they will sue me if I try to move-out. I have been journaling the events, but I feel like this whole thing is hopeless. I hate that I still seek attention and affection, too. I feel so disgusted with myself. I also feel like M jumps between hot and cold to punish me and demonstrate that they have control in the relationship. Is this why abuser will seem really angry and/or distant one moment, super affectionate the next, and then angry/belittling?",domesticviolence
App idea?,"Hi all,

I have a few questions I was hoping you might be able to provide me!

I just want to start by saying that this is (barely) an app idea but I wanted to check if it was worth it for victims. I'll briefly explain what I've thought of so far...

Firstly I presume that there is a lot of surveillance in these situations and was wondering how far does it go. E.g. social media for example.
I thought that for safety's sake having a skin (for example a duplication of some boring app like calculator) that can be only removed with a password
- is this likely to work? Do you think that person will notice a duplication of an app they don't use often?

Secondly the app itself... I was going to try and see to make it more of a ""collection of evidence"" so when that person manages to break the cycle they have the proof, I've seen a few posts about the police's limitations/lack of interest and I thought perhaps this would help? So things I thought you could store in here
- photos (not accessible from gallery) or videos/voice recordings, maybe pdfs of any hospital visits that would record this?
- a diary of some sort, either for your own use or to note attacks/incidences
- if possible some sort of secret bank account, but I can see some limitations of this happening due to potential surveillance on bank statements. 
- resources/advice 

Any comments on what I have listed or further ideas? 

Thanks everyone, stay safe xx",domesticviolence
How do my mom and I escape my emotionally abusive father?,"My alcoholic father has been verbally, emotionally, and mentally abusive for over 16 years. It’s gotten worse over the years and he recently threatened physical violence against my mother.

It’s not as extreme as many other abuse cases, but I’ve self-harmed for 6 years now due to it and my mother is severely depressed. We feel trapped. We have no where to go. I’m 16 and she’s 45. We have two cats and 4 dogs, so living with a nearby relative wouldn’t be an option.

I turned my current relationship into what I escaped in my previous relationship. Let me explain.,"
This might be a long post. I apologize in advance. 




Okay so to start let me give you the backstory of my previous relationship. I will try to be brief. I was 17 and fresh outta high school messing with a man who was 23 years older than me. Within months of meeting him i moved in with him (on my 18th birthday). He almost immediately became controlling and possessive. About a month into living with him he beat me unconscious for the first time. I tried to leave he begged me to stay, promise to never do it again, bought me expensive gifts to say sorry, and of course gave me some money. Of course I believed him and forgave him. He was sweet again for maybe a week - if that long before we got into it again. He slaps me but this time i fight back. By the time we’re done we are both bloody and bruised. “It doesn’t count as abuse if you fight back right? We just had a fight. People fight.” This is a phrase i said to myself throughout the rest of our relationship. Soon we’re physically fighting every day if not every other day. It got to the point that i no longer waited for him to hit me first whenever he got that certain look on his face i would swing first. It got to the point that all we would do is fight and fuck. I lived with him for a total of 11 months. I stayed through all the physical abuse, the verbal abuse, being beaten into a miscarriage, being locked in a room for days, and so much more. It took something extremely drastic for me to finally leave him (i wont share what cause its extremely fucked up and doesn’t pertain to this particular post. Maybe ill share my story with him more in depth another day) and when i did i was at the lowest place I’ve ever been mentally. 

Once i left the relationship i was so low i tried, unsuccessfully thankfully, to take my own life. I took that as a sign that i wasnt my time. I tried to get back to the life i had before him. I thought that would help bring me out that low place but it didnt. The same things didn’t bring me joy anymore cause i was no longer same person. The naive innocent little girl who entered that relationship died with it. I began smoking weed everyday and drinking just to cope with having to still live life. I was always the strong one emotionally so noone ever knew how i was really feeling and how i was still so close to giving up. 

Three months later i still can’t shake the feelings of hopelessness. It was like I couldn’t find where i belonged in this world anymore. I decide that it would be the night id go for it again and this time i wouldn’t fail. I decide to give my self a fun “last day” and spend majority of it just being out and about with my closest friends at that time. I had recently reconnected with an old friend (lets call him Sean and hit him up on some humbug shit. A part of me trying to prolong what i had planned.

We spend the night just smoking, talking, vibing. Before i know it its 4:00 in the morning. We end up having mind blowing sex. I didnt feel so miserable anymore, it made me rethink. Before i know if me and Sean start messing around heavy. After a month we make things exclusive. He’s shared all the issues he had going on at the time (he had been shot multiple times the year before and got arrested because the people that shot him claimed he was trying to rob them even though there was proof that it wasn’t true. So now he was fighting a case. ) i told him everything id been through in my last relationship. He helped me through having nightmares &amp;amp; panic attacks. Helped build my self confidence up. Basically he lifted me out of that darkness. 

Now here’s where the issues began, i hadn’t allowed myself to heal from my last relationship so i still reacted to things as i would have with my ex. Whenever me and Sean argued and it got really heated i got physical and always taunted him to be physical back. I constantly accused him of cheating, randomly went through his phone, etc. After we had our first son the physical stuff got worse. We would fight each other leaving scratches a small marks on each other. And the violence only got worse once i found the proof of him cheating and cheated back for get back (yes he knew. I told him the next day). Now we’re fighting multiple times a day both bruised, bloody, busted lips, you name it. Neither of us trusting the other one.

Then i end up pregnant with our youngest child. I expect the fighting to stop. I was always the one to throw the first lick in our fights so i figure just stop hitting him. Simple right? No. He no longer cared who threw the first hit. We’d grown accustomed to the fighting and he no longer had an issue hitting me first. We fought worse when i was pregnant than when i wasn’t. He’d choke me until i passed out. Id throw anything i can get my hands on at him. Me biting and scratching him. Us pulling each others hair out. 

Id turned my relationship into exactly what i had just escaped. Our most recent fight was yesterday. I dont even remember why. He choked me and scratched my neck up. Stomped me in the stomach multiple times. Hit me in the head with a bottle drawing lots of blood. Along with slamming against the wall a few times. I bit his arm until it bled. Kicked him in the nuts. Busted his lip. Scratched his arms and chest up. And threw a hair brush at him. I dont know how to get us out of this place. Both of us have horrible anger issues and will not hesitate to be physical with the other one

But when its good. Its good! Like even when we mad at each other we got each others back. He’s still my best friend. Our relationship is bipolar and i just want to remove the toxic elements and according to him. He does too. We want a better relationship and to show our kids better but have no idea where to even start 🤦🏾‍♀️",domesticviolence

Traumatic Brain Injury from domestic abuse?,"This may kind of be a ridiculous question but I've read a lot about TBI's and PTSD (which I have, I was diagnosed with PTSD before I even met my current abusive partner. But I've been hit across the head a few times by him. (I know he's a POS and as soon as my safety plan us secured, I'm out, so please don't just tell me to get out. I want to and I'm going to) But in 5years time I've written off my memory problems and some other things that could be a TBI or it could be stress and PTSD! But I'm curious first off, is it even possible or likely, to get one from this kind of abuse? He's left some marks alright and he's not been gentle but like .. I've never needed medical intervention or paramedics called. The worst, (and what I wonder about having been the more harmful incident  then I initially realized is), being hit in the head while laying down already, so I didn't fall and I was on a bed. But I got very dizzy and I felt like I lost quite a few brain cells because although he walked away after that, I was talking to myself in gibberish I didn't even understand! He asked me to repeat myself one time as he heard me talking and I repeated the stupid question-that made zero sense and when he asked me WTF I was talking about I began crying again out of frustration because he didn't understand me. But at the time, even I didn't understand me and I knew I was making no sense. And I remember most of this actually all of it as far as I know. It's like the words were just falling out of my mouth and I couldn't stop them and I couldn't interject anyting sensible.

A few of these incidences have occurred in the last few years but I always end up being fine afterwards. Is it even possible that I have damaged that I don't know about? How would I bring this up to my doctor if I want to have it checked out? (Especially because I'm planning on filing charges against him when I leave for sexual assault)

He's getting worse and I need help,"I'm 21(F) and my boyfriend is (22M).  We've been together for two years, and about four months ago we moved in together into a granny flat on my parents property.  They're always around, as they live in a bigger unit with my younger siblings (11F, 9M and 7M).  Before we moved, we'd occasionally get into arguments, but the worst he'd done before that was call me a cunt.  However, as we've been living together he's gotten worse.  When I bring up something that I'm upset about, he refuses to admit he's done anything wrong, it seems that suddenly it's all flipped around and I have to defend myself while he screams at me and calls me such foul things I can't repeat.  He has a bad temper when he drinks, and after an altercation with my dad he promised to not drink anymore.  He's kicked my dog in the ribs as hard as he could (she's a smaller dog).  My little sister saw my dad take him to the ground.  He's screamed in my mum's face.  He's punched walls, shoved me, locked me out of our flat and thrown my stuff around.  

It's recently got worse, as I had to buy a new phone and told him to save some money so we'd have enough for the fortnight.  He decided to still go ahead with online shopping, buying a new guitar and alcohol.  Normally, I don't care what he spends his money on, he's free to spend his money on his online shopping because I can save my money to make sure we don't go without.  I wasn't happy, but didn't say anything.  Unexpectedly, we ran out of money.  It was ok, I still had just enough smokes to get us through to payday.  However the night before when he was drinking, I noticed I had barely two smokes left.  I asked him about it, and he claimed to have no idea of what happened to it.  Before we went to bed, I gave him my last smoke and went into the bedroom irritated and upset.  When he asked what was wrong, I told him about how I asked him to save money and now we'd either have to smoke out of the ash tray or deal with nicotine withdrawals.  He said it wasn't his fault, he wanted to buy something for himself for once.  I brought up that I never buy anything for myself, I asked him not to once.  It was back and forth of him telling me I didn't need to buy a phone, and me trying to argue why I do need one.  Then, I brought up that he didn't need to buy a guitar and he said that he does *need* it.  He started calling me horrible names, and said I need to be supportive of his dreams to become a rockstar.  I told him that we live in the real world and need to survive first.    

Eventually I left to have a smoke out of the ash tray and was standing in the doorway, while he was yelling at me.  He said I drain him dry of money, ignoring that for most of the relationship I spend most of my paycheck buying him drugs.  He got pissed off I was having a smoke and demanded I get out of doorway, I told him my parents don't care where I smoke and I pay my rent.  It was like his eyes turned black.  He charged towards me and pushed me out of the room, he raised his hand and he smacked my arm hard, knocking the cigarette out of my hand and trying to slam the door in my face.  I pushed the door open and he cornered me against the door frame and hit my arm again.  I broke down crying. 

He told me to drop the crying act, that I brought it on myself by riling him up.  He called me some of the most foulest things I've heard in my life.  He said he couldn't believe he fell in love with someone like me.  Later when he calmed down he went to bed.  He promised he'd never do it again and apologised when I brought it up.  I feel shitty that I took him in when he was homeless, that I helped him out with money, helped him get a job and he does that to me.  I already have one permanent injury from a previous abusive relationship, I'm so scared of being stalked, lied about and harassed again.",domesticviolence

"Sleep Struggles, dreams and flashbacks, any advice?",I’ve had reoccurring dreams on and off for about 7 years now.

"I'm probably, most definitely being stupid","So I had posted about a week ago. Sorry, new to reddit so I don't know how to add a link to it. 
Long story short... Husband (42 M)and I (39 F) bickered. Neither of us have ever been physically aggressive with each other before, but I grabbed his arm out of anger.

So, update is...the next day I waited for him to get home (with pepper spray hidden in my hand) from work and told him that we needed to talk on the weekend. Our schedules are pretty opposite so it is easy to avoid each other. There was an apology and an ""I'm a piece of shit"" but I told him I was tired and we'd talk later that weekend. Slept with a tire thumper in my bed that week in case. He was pretty much living in the basement. 

So the weekend comes. I come downstairs to talk. He just puts his arms out to hug me. I do. We lay there for a while. End up having sex several times, but never talked about anything really. The next day (yesterday), things feel good. We have a good morning together. We decide to go out for a late lunch. I am big on pictures so I take one of us. After a nice lunch we go to leave. In the car he asks to see the photo. I show him and he hits the back button and all photos come up. Well I had taken pictures of my pea sized bruise and the broken mirror. He says, ""oh what's that?"". 
Now I wanted to work things out, but that doesn't mean I was back to a point where I am comfortable that he isn't going to overreact to things. So I grabbed my phone, said they were just selfies. I took a few minutes to breathe and compose myself then tell him what they really were. Well he had obviously already figured that out. He is now pissed at me again because I tried to hide it. Says it is fucked up that I was trying to be secretive and what else am I going to be secretive about basically. 
He ended up retreating to the basement again when we got home. I was just enjoying the day after 3 weeks of hell and didn't want to spoil it. But because I took several minutes to tell the truth, apparently I'm in the wrong. 
I'm still in love, but I think I'm being stupid.",domesticviolence
"Post-Trauma sleep struggles and flashbacks, looking for advice",I’ve had reoccurring dreams on and off for about 7 years now.  The dreams are based on snippets of domestic and sexual violence with my ex-partner.   There are times when arguments with my now husband may trigger some elements of bad memories which doesn’t help.  I’m wondering if anyone has any techniques they could perhaps recommend for calming down after a nasty nightmare or night terror?  They are very frightening for me still.  I wake up and still feel like I’m living it and find it very hard to calm myself down enough again to sleep.  I rarely get flashbacks during the day; although this may be because I seem to be better at controlling them now.  Any suggestions would be gratefully received.,domesticviolence
Its my brother,"I’m a bit younger than my brother and we usually have a pretty good relationship until he gets mad. Im a girl, so I can’t stand up to him and make him stop hurting me and punching me. The worst part is that he is completely blind to my emotions, even though I’ve told him numerous times that what he’s doing is too much. It’s been like this for years, I absolutely hate him, but I don’t hate him at the same time. He is often my only friend (we have a lot in common). He is angry only for a couple minutes, I run away, cry for hours, but he is fine in just seconds. I just wish I didn’t wake up the next morning. If I try ignoring him, because I don’t want to talk to him, when the rest of my family comes back home, he’ll speak for me and say that I’m in my bad mood. My BaD mOoooD. He laughs. When I tell him, he doesn’t see it as a big deal. At this point, I’ve accepted that this will only last a few more years and then I won’t have to see him everyday. This quarantine is hell. I just wanted to share.",domesticviolence
I feel like I am drowning..,"*I AM NOT ASKING OR LOOKING FOR ANY HANDOUTS OR ANYTHING I REALLY JUST NEED ALL THE ADVICE I CAN GET BECAUSE I AM HOPING AND PRAYING WITH EVERYTHING I HAVE THAT SOMEONE HAS THE ANSWER OR DEVICE OR THE CHIP OR THE ONE PLACE AND MAYBE I HAVE NOT THOUGHT OF YET OR THAT ME BEING SO STRESSED, CRYING, AND NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO THAT MAYBE MY MIND FORGOT IT... AND I NEED PRAYERS SO MANY PRAYERS I APPRECIATE THEM ALL BECAUSE GOD KNOWS I NEED PRAYERS RIGHT NOW I FEEL LIKE I'M DROWNING I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO ANYMORE

**HELP**
So I ran with my four children in the middle of the night to get away from my abusive husband. My friend picked us up and took us two hours and 45 mins away to her house to be safe. I have a preemie who is 7 pounds now ..a two year old...9 year old...and 12 year old. Apparently in the midst of grabbing everything from the house I forgot my wic Similac neosure for my baby and I just ran COMPLETELY out and no money to buy any and I honestly do not know what to do..I'm so scared. My friend who we moved in with is out of funds and I have no family. I called the pediatricians around here and none have any samples and hospital says they have a shortage for labor and delivery only right now. I am at a loss and so scared...anyone have any ideas because I'm out of all...oh the two local food banks here do not have ANY formula...idk I need prayers and help

I just want to give up but I know I can not do that because I am all that my four babies have. Especially now that I left and pretty much us 5 is all we have.. we have no other family and the only friend that we have is the one that is allowing us to live with her until we can get on our feet to get our own house. 

I just feel so hopeless and useless because I cannot even provide for my own children what kind of mother am I? Maybe I shouldn't have left or maybe I should go back and just deal with it for the well being of my children I do not know what to do or what to think I honestly just feel like a failure what I mean is I have failed as a mother... A wife..and  just a woman in general!! 

I CALLED SIMILAC AND THEY ARE GOING TO SEND ME SOME FORMULA BUT IT TAKES AROUND 14 DAYS TO PROCESS THE ORDER THEN THEY SHIP IT OUT SO THE LADY ON THE PHONE SAID I CAN EXPECT IT AROUND 20 TO 30 DAYS OR A MONTH PRETTY MUCH. I ALSO CALLED WIC TWICE ACTUALLY, AND TALK TO TWO DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND EXPLAINED MY SITUATION AND THEY CHECKED AND THEY HAVE NO SAMPLES OR EXTRAS OF ANY KIND OF FORMULA.  THEY GAVE ME THE SOONEST APPOINTMENT THEY COULD WHICH IS THIS COMING THURSDAY. BUT I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT SOMETHING NOW BECAUSE WE ARE COMPLETELY OUT OF THE SIMILAC NEOSURE NOW. I HAVE NONE TO GIVE MY SON SO I HAVE BEEN CALLING MESSAGING AND DOING EVERYTHING I CAN THINK OF TO AT LEAST COME UP WITH THE $24 TO BUY A CAN TO AT LEAST LAST TILL WIC APPOINTMENT THURSDAY. 

I HAD ASKED ALL MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY THE LOAN ME SOME MONEY OR TO EVEN SEND A VIRTUAL GIFT CARD AND I TOLD THEM I WOULD PAY THEM BACK FRIDAY AT MIDNIGHT TRIPLE THE AMOUNT. WHICH PRETTY MUCH MEANS THAT FOR $25 I WAS OFFERING TO GIVE THEM $75 AND THE LAST 2 PEOPLE I ASKED I TOLD THEM I WOULD PAY THEM BACK $100 FOR THE 25 AND NO SUCCESS YET BUT I CAN'T GIVE UP I HAVE TO FIGURE THIS OUT ASAP.",domesticviolence
"Why do so many women who, after being abused once, end up alone or having to leave yet another abuser?","Pretty much the title. It applies to myself, but also many other women I’ve known.

They’re not stupid or ignorant, and they do the best anyone could. They’re not insecure or weak. They’re looking for the same things everyone else on this planet is.

They get therapy after the first abusive relationship and “put in the work”. They wait before going into another relationship, and know the signs. They excel and are happy in every other (non-romantic/sexual) area of their lives, usually, from career to finances to developing community and close friendships. They have strong senses of self and self-esteem.

They know the warning signs, and leave partners as soon as they begin to exhibit them. They seek and listen to anything a therapist or friend might say about a new partner’s vibe, personality, treatment.

They don’t die from the abuse, because they’re strong and smart enough to walk away.

But repeatedly, at a percentage significantly higher than the general population’s, they find themselves *having* to walk away from yet another abuser. Maybe the abuser hides all signs for the first few months, or even until a proposal or marriage. The abused woman isn’t stupid, and he fooled everyone else around her as well. She learned from her mistakes the first time. She sought others’ opinions and listened to her gut. 

Yet so many of us end up with yet another abuse story. We ultimately end up “safe”, sure, as we either leave or effectively give up and remain single.

These abusers ultimately reveal—after hiding or denying it previously—past partners they abused. I wouldn’t condone victim blaming, but I’d almost like to blame myself, as that’d give me some control here. But I can’t.

So, why is the ideal outcome of finding a loving, healthy, respectful partnership with someone we’re sexually attracted to so elusive and rare for us? Are we sexually geared to only be attracted to the pheromones of an abuser? Is that physically even possible? If it’s biological, is it possible to change this? Are we all doomed to biological infertility unless we do it all on our own? Are we just permanently damaged and destined to be single, or with an abuser? Why does this keep happening? Why does it keep happening to women who were happy on their own and with everything in their lives, aware of the signs, and so on?

And please, although I know there’s a massive selection bias here, and the stats show you’re the rarer case, if you have a success story that involves a happy, healthy marriage, please do share :)",domesticviolence

My brother is a monster,"I’ve posted in here before about my the abuse I went through at the hands of my oldest brother. Briefly some of these things include him punching/slapping/kicking me, choking me, suffocating me, and burning me with lighters. We will call this brother A. I kept the abuse a secret from my parents for years until I was 20 and finally started to open up about it. They don’t really believe it was as serious as I say it was. I have another brother who is the middle child and was also abused by our oldest brother. We will call him brother X. After talking with X the other day I realize things were so much worse than I ever could have imagined. 

X admitted to me that A used to sexually abuse him and I had no idea. It went on for years and I was completely oblivious. I knew A was violent and sadistic, but I could never have anticipated him raping my brother. I have done nothing but sob for the last two days after finding this out. I have screamed into my pillow until my throat became raw. I am so angry. 

I’m angry that I was small and weak and wouldn’t have been able to help even if I knew. I’m angry my parents constantly forced us into silence by never believing anything we said about A. I’m angry X had to endure this alone for so many years. I have decided this was the last straw and from this day forward I will cut A out of my life permanently. He will never see or speak to me again. From this day forward when people ask I will say I only have one other sibling. I have so much hate in my heart.",domesticviolence
“Me too” for Domestic Violence?,"So about a year ago was the last attack from my ex boyfriend. He gave me a black eye (my second one) and punched me in my back several times. I have not seen him since. I have struggled to cope and heal from the aftermath of that relationship. I am good friends with his sister (was for years before our relationship) and am very close to his family. All of them have encouraged me to press charges in the past but I’m only now feeling ready. I’m located in Illinois and not sure of the law here regarding time limit with this kind of thing. Obviously will speak to a lawyer but wanted to get some input here first if anyone has any information. Anyway, my ex hit me many times and I have pictures of the 2 black eyes he gave me, but no proof of any of the other attacks. I am friends with his son’s mother who also says she was abused by him when she was with him and has given me an eerily similar description of what their relationship was like. She never pressed charges either. I recently also came into contact with another ex girlfriend of his who he used to abuse - he actually broke her ribs on the last attack. I am aware of other women he has dated and used and abused as well. He is a serial abuser and I believe he needs to be held accountable for his actions, no matter how long ago they were. I also believe he will hurt someone else and am afraid he will go too far one day. I’m wondering if anyone has any information that could help me in this situation? Is there a timeline for when you can report or press charges for physical assault? Would all of the women have to file a police report in order for their stories to matter? What is the best way to go about this ? 

Please be kind and thank you in advance for any help you may offer.",domesticviolence
*I hope someone takes the time to read this. I could really use advice* I should hate him. Why do I feel guilty for planning to finally leave him?,"I'm having a hard time sorting out my thoughts about everything. My boyfriend was recently arrested for the 3rd time for assaulting me. This time he was charged with strangling me, and with child endangerment for doing so in front of our 5 year old. We've been together for 8 years. He popped my elbow out of place the first time he was arrested about 7 years ago. I had to go to the hospital that time and have my arm in asing for several weeks. The 2nd time,  3 years ago,  he punched me in the face multiple times, then grabbed our daughter and took off in the vehicle with her. We had to convince him he wouldn't be arrested to get her brought back safely. He ended up going to rehab that time for 6 months, but was relapsing soon after getting back home and it wasn't long before he was being violent again. The times he's physically abused me are too many to count. He's held me in a room with a knife to my throat threatening to kill me and screaming at me for 2 hours. He's slammed my head into the back of the ceramic toilet so hard that my vision went black and I thought I was going to die. He held a machete to my throat a few months ago and threatened to kill me again. He's choked me so hard that I couldn't breathe and hand handprints on my throat at least 5 to times. There's so much more. Typing this stuff brings up feelings of resentment, hopelessness, anger, fear, I literally have tears in my eyes thinking about it. But I'm still struggling to make the decision to leave. I have an opportunity to finally leave because he was put in jail and is now in rehab. I need to go before his 28 day rehab stay is over. But, for some reason the rehab is allowing him to call me repeatedly, at least 3 times a day; and it's really hard on me. He's not even legally supposed to be contacting me. But no one is monitoring him when he's on the phone. And I can't call and say anything to the staff. It's a really horrible situation. My daughter and I are still in his house, which his parents own. They come over here constantly. They want to make sure I'm around for him to support him in rehab and to make sure he gets his life together when he gets out. They keep telling me he deserves another chance. It's so ridiculous. It really hurts me. I've had to call his parents or go to their house many times with my daughter because of his violence. They always bring me right back here to him. One time I ran out of the house and took his vehicle and drove to their house after he had punched me so bad that my eye had swollen shut. My daughter had spent the night at their house the night before and was already there. They brought my daughter and I home to him less than 2 hours later. I have to get away from here. I know this short rehab stay won't help him. I want to do what's best for my daughter and I. I've been controlled by him, and his family, for so long and I'm scared. I'm scared to make my own decisions. I feel so unsure of myself. I just want to raise my daughter in a stable and healthy environment. I hope I'm doing the right thing. I don't think he deserves any more chances. I've been afraid he was going to kill me so many times. This is my only shot. I hope I find the strength to do what's right.",domesticviolence

1. Who is your abuser? Is it a partner or a sibling or parent etc. ?

2. What are some of the things that your abuser has done to you?

3.  Are you male or female, how has this affected your reaction to the abuse?

4. How old are you/how old were you when you were abused?

5. What effect has the abuse had on your life? Has it left you with traumas, PTSD, anxiety, depression, night terrors etc. ? Were you able to let it go? How has it affected future relationships, or your future in general?

6. How has the abuse affected your friends and family and your relationship with them?

7. How did your abuser justify their behaviour, what were their excuses?

8. What are some traits of an abuser, how do they act? How do you recognize abusers, how did you realise you were being abused?


9. Where do you live and how does your country punish abusers?

"Male. 30. I normally wouldn't seek for advice, but I'm clueless right now.","Arms are scratched, button-up is ripped, and my ears are ringing. 

Mel got drunk and angry again. Why? my daughter decided to lift her dress up while in the house. “I will not raise her to be a whore”   
Great… I agree. It’s not great that she did that, but how she responded did not match the action.

After discipling my daughter, I consoled her. That made Mel angrier. She pulled my daughter’s hair. She got mad at me so she took it out on my daughter.   
This made me angry. I took my daughter upstairs away from Mel, and of course she followed.

Her and I clearly don’t meet eye to eye on this. We fight. She pushes my daughter because she is crying and she is mad at me. I push her and tell her never to touch her like that again.

I’m not defenseless. I keep pushing her back. I pull my calf muscle so I’m stuck on the bed now. She keeps punching me. I take my daughter downstairs slowly. She is hitting me and pushing me from behind. I could’ve fell while carrying my daughter. 

Downstairs she tells my daughter this is all her fault, but it somehow is also my fault. “What dadda did was wrong, but it happened because of you”. I try to stay, but she keeps kicking me while I’m just cuddling my daughter. She says she wants to stay with my daughter but doesn’t want me around. I guess I’m babying her… Also she keeps telling my daughter this is all my fault and saying that “Whatever Dad says is a lie”. This is so infuriating... Do I step down to her level? She takes my daughter back upstairs and tells me not to come up. I comply because I can’t really walk. Of course she comes back down by herself 2 minutes later. This was never about wanting to spend time with my daughter.

She leaves me alone for 20 minutes and then comes over. She tries to say this is all my fault. I tell her I don’t want to talk to her. “Right now, I find you disgusting” I tell her. After letting me know that I just ruined my daughter's life because she now thinks it’s okay for men to push women, she tells me one day she is going to stab me. She is only with me to make my life miserable… her actual words. She says I’m faking my calf injury and is insisting on taking a look at it. I tell her to not touch me. She gets mad and tries to hit me. Scratches me and bites once again. 

This is over. my daughter deserves better than her and even me. Hopefully I get custody, but that’s never going to happen. I need to pick up what I have and move on, but I don’t know how. I want to be with my daughter, but I don’t see how this can happen

“You enjoyed stabbing me in the face”,"I am posting this because I want to document it. I don’t know where else to put it. My husband was shit-faced drunk and was lying upstairs on the floor. I let him sit for about 30 minutes and then checked on him. I asked if he wanted something to eat and then I brought him a piece of toast and some water. I then left him alone for another 30 minutes and then came back and tried to get ready for bed. He then pinned me down and tried to strangle me. I laughed at first because I didn’t know what to do and figured he was fine.

I then started feeling like I couldn’t breathe. I was in the middle of flossing my teeth so I tried to jam my flosser in his face. He laid off and went away. I laid there for a few minutes and then went on getting ready for bed. He then said “you enjoyed stabbing me in the face, right?”. I have given him the silent treatment since.

He has said “are you so mad that you’re trying to kill the cats” and “did you mean what you meant downstairs” and “they don’t deserve to be involved with this” as ways to attempt to manipulate my emotions. None of this is real.

Trapped with no money to leave fast. Strangled two days ago.,"Hear me out I know it’s long. I’m in a bad relationship, it’s been toxic &amp; he has put hands on me (choked me out 3+ years ago (5years together)) i felt like he knew if he crossed it ever again, it would be the end. Well he’s been hostile with me for months. Dirty looks emotionally draining me &amp; our daughter (3y) gets it too since he does it in front of her. I’ve stayed cause I’m scared what would happen if I leave, plus I do love him &amp; beg for change. he gets violent when I ask him to leave, or if I talk about how to fix ya, he breaks things, yells &amp; gets in my face. But Nothing that made me frightened for my life, until, two days ago he snapped. He first hit me &amp; my daughter with a silk long pillow hard, knocks my head onto hers hard. We were cuddled about to sleep my daughter &amp; I. Then he gets her (picks her up) , she wanted me, I get her back after begging &amp; told him to go or I was calling the cops. He moved or tossed her off of me onto my legs, it was fast- then choked me with one hand &amp; plugged my nose &amp; mouth with the other. He stopped but I seen black, almost fainted maybe? I don’t remember it all happened so fast. We are here with him until he goes to work Tuesday, we’re acting cool like nothing happened &amp; so is he. But I only have $122 &amp; I don’t have breaks or Ac in car &amp; might need a rotor before I can go. That will break me or might not be enough. But I think if I have a friend help who won’t charge much- we can make $122 work to Fix it. I need gas to get to either North Carolina to his family who knows everything &amp; will protect me while helping him (he won’t know I’m out of our state) or I can go to Florida to my sister &amp; her gram. I just need to pay to get there. Food for Ride, gas &amp; a hotel for a night maybe two depending on where I choose to go. I can’t knock it out in a day being the only driver. I don’t know how I can get money, $, to leave by Tuesday when that’s my only day I can leave in secrecy. Any help to make fast cash will be appreciated &amp; repaid when I’m on my feet, please no scams. I don’t want to post all my proof here that includes last names of my family. I’ll scratch last names out of photos. But this is all my life. I wish I was lying. I love him, he is only here for our daughter he does nothing for besides traumatize her. She’s scared of loud noises &amp; it’s cause of him. 
Ps getting pfa morning before I leave, I pray i can Tuesday... pray for us please. He takes my phone sometimes when he senses something. So here’s to making it to Tuesday with a phone &amp; money to leave before he snaps again &amp; doesn’t stop.

I turned my current relationship into what I escaped in my previous relationship. Let me explain.,"
This might be a long post. I apologize in advance. 




Okay so to start let me give you the backstory of my previous relationship. I will try to be brief. I was 17 and fresh outta high school messing with a man who was 23 years older than me. Within months of meeting him i moved in with him (on my 18th birthday). He almost immediately became controlling and possessive. About a month into living with him he beat me unconscious for the first time. I tried to leave he begged me to stay, promise to never do it again, bought me expensive gifts to say sorry, and of course gave me some money. Of course I believed him and forgave him. He was sweet again for maybe a week - if that long before we got into it again. He slaps me but this time i fight back. By the time we’re done we are both bloody and bruised. “It doesn’t count as abuse if you fight back right? We just had a fight. People fight.” This is a phrase i said to myself throughout the rest of our relationship. Soon we’re physically fighting every day if not every other day. It got to the point that i no longer waited for him to hit me first whenever he got that certain look on his face i would swing first. It got to the point that all we would do is fight and fuck. I lived with him for a total of 11 months. I stayed through all the physical abuse, the verbal abuse, being beaten into a miscarriage, being locked in a room for days, and so much more. It took something extremely drastic for me to finally leave him (i wont share what cause its extremely fucked up and doesn’t pertain to this particular post. Maybe ill share my story with him more in depth another day) and when i did i was at the lowest place I’ve ever been mentally. 

Once i left the relationship i was so low i tried, unsuccessfully thankfully, to take my own life. I took that as a sign that i wasnt my time. I tried to get back to the life i had before him. I thought that would help bring me out that low place but it didnt. The same things didn’t bring me joy anymore cause i was no longer same person. The naive innocent little girl who entered that relationship died with it. I began smoking weed everyday and drinking just to cope with having to still live life. I was always the strong one emotionally so noone ever knew how i was really feeling and how i was still so close to giving up. 

Three months later i still can’t shake the feelings of hopelessness. It was like I couldn’t find where i belonged in this world anymore. I decide that it would be the night id go for it again and this time i wouldn’t fail. I decide to give my self a fun “last day” and spend majority of it just being out and about with my closest friends at that time. I had recently reconnected with an old friend (lets call him Sean and hit him up on some humbug shit. A part of me trying to prolong what i had planned.

We spend the night just smoking, talking, vibing. Before i know it its 4:00 in the morning. We end up having mind blowing sex. I didnt feel so miserable anymore, it made me rethink. Before i know if me and Sean start messing around heavy. After a month we make things exclusive. He’s shared all the issues he had going on at the time (he had been shot multiple times the year before and got arrested because the people that shot him claimed he was trying to rob them even though there was proof that it wasn’t true. So now he was fighting a case. ) i told him everything id been through in my last relationship. He helped me through having nightmares &amp;amp; panic attacks. Helped build my self confidence up. Basically he lifted me out of that darkness. 

Now here’s where the issues began, i hadn’t allowed myself to heal from my last relationship so i still reacted to things as i would have with my ex. Whenever me and Sean argued and it got really heated i got physical and always taunted him to be physical back. I constantly accused him of cheating, randomly went through his phone, etc. After we had our first son the physical stuff got worse. We would fight each other leaving scratches a small marks on each other. And the violence only got worse once i found the proof of him cheating and cheated back for get back (yes he knew. I told him the next day). Now we’re fighting multiple times a day both bruised, bloody, busted lips, you name it. Neither of us trusting the other one.

Then i end up pregnant with our youngest child. I expect the fighting to stop. I was always the one to throw the first lick in our fights so i figure just stop hitting him. Simple right? No. He no longer cared who threw the first hit. We’d grown accustomed to the fighting and he no longer had an issue hitting me first. We fought worse when i was pregnant than when i wasn’t. He’d choke me until i passed out. Id throw anything i can get my hands on at him. Me biting and scratching him. Us pulling each others hair out. 

Id turned my relationship into exactly what i had just escaped. Our most recent fight was yesterday. I dont even remember why. He choked me and scratched my neck up. Stomped me in the stomach multiple times. Hit me in the head with a bottle drawing lots of blood. Along with slamming against the wall a few times. I bit his arm until it bled. Kicked him in the nuts. Busted his lip. Scratched his arms and chest up. And threw a hair brush at him. I dont know how to get us out of this place. Both of us have horrible anger issues and will not hesitate to be physical with the other one

But when its good. Its good! Like even when we mad at each other we got each others back. He’s still my best friend. Our relationship is bipolar and i just want to remove the toxic elements and according to him. He does too. We want a better relationship and to show our kids better but have no idea where to even start 🤦🏾‍♀️",domesticviolence

Can someone talk some sense into me?,"I (28F) was with my (25M) for 3 years, we broke up briefly last year and when we got back together our relationship was beautiful and fun, until a few months passed he lost his shit at me for wanting him to spend the night with me (after barely seeing him) and hasn't spoken to me since start of April.

Idk why, but I've managed to forget the first 2 years of our relationship when he threaten to kill me, choked me, pushed me across the room, yelled at me, called me a whore for wearing an outfit that showed a little bit of skin and pushed me into a highway once plus more. 

This is abuse, clearly, but in my mind I keep making excuses. Why am I not seeing him for the abuser that he is?",domesticviolence
Domestic Violence,"Hey everyone, im a grade 12 student from Queensland and i was really intrigued into how to stop this ongoing stigma of domestic violence.

Traumatic Brain Injury from domestic abuse?,"This may kind of be a ridiculous question but I've read a lot about TBI's and PTSD (which I have, I was diagnosed with PTSD before I even met my current abusive partner. But I've been hit across the head a few times by him. (I know he's a POS and as soon as my safety plan us secured, I'm out, so please don't just tell me to get out. I want to and I'm going to) But in 5years time I've written off my memory problems and some other things that could be a TBI or it could be stress and PTSD! But I'm curious first off, is it even possible or likely, to get one from this kind of abuse? He's left some marks alright and he's not been gentle but like .. I've never needed medical intervention or paramedics called. The worst, (and what I wonder about having been the more harmful incident  then I initially realized is), being hit in the head while laying down already, so I didn't fall and I was on a bed. But I got very dizzy and I felt like I lost quite a few brain cells because although he walked away after that, I was talking to myself in gibberish I didn't even understand! He asked me to repeat myself one time as he heard me talking and I repeated the stupid question-that made zero sense and when he asked me WTF I was talking about I began crying again out of frustration because he didn't understand me. But at the time, even I didn't understand me and I knew I was making no sense. And I remember most of this actually all of it as far as I know. It's like the words were just falling out of my mouth and I couldn't stop them and I couldn't interject anyting sensible.

A few of these incidences have occurred in the last few years but I always end up being fine afterwards. Is it even possible that I have damaged that I don't know about? How would I bring this up to my doctor if I want to have it checked out? (Especially because I'm planning on filing charges against him when I leave for sexual assault)

Thx in advance ❤️",domesticviolence
He's getting worse and I need help,"I'm 21(F) and my boyfriend is (22M).  We've been together for two years, and about four months ago we moved in together into a granny flat on my parents property.  They're always around, as they live in a bigger unit with my younger siblings (11F, 9M and 7M).  Before we moved, we'd occasionally get into arguments, but the worst he'd done before that was call me a cunt.  However, as we've been living together he's gotten worse.  When I bring up something that I'm upset about, he refuses to admit he's done anything wrong, it seems that suddenly it's all flipped around and I have to defend myself while he screams at me and calls me such foul things I can't repeat.  He has a bad temper when he drinks, and after an altercation with my dad he promised to not drink anymore.  He's kicked my dog in the ribs as hard as he could (she's a smaller dog).  My little sister saw my dad take him to the ground.  He's screamed in my mum's face.  He's punched walls, shoved me, locked me out of our flat and thrown my stuff around.  

It's recently got worse, as I had to buy a new phone and told him to save some money so we'd have enough for the fortnight.  He decided to still go ahead with online shopping, buying a new guitar and alcohol.  Normally, I don't care what he spends his money on, he's free to spend his money on his online shopping because I can save my money to make sure we don't go without.  I wasn't happy, but didn't say anything.  Unexpectedly, we ran out of money.  It was ok, I still had just enough smokes to get us through to payday.  However the night before when he was drinking, I noticed I had barely two smokes left.  I asked him about it, and he claimed to have no idea of what happened to it.  Before we went to bed, I gave him my last smoke and went into the bedroom irritated and upset.  When he asked what was wrong, I told him about how I asked him to save money and now we'd either have to smoke out of the ash tray or deal with nicotine withdrawals.  He said it wasn't his fault, he wanted to buy something for himself for once.  I brought up that I never buy anything for myself, I asked him not to once.  It was back and forth of him telling me I didn't need to buy a phone, and me trying to argue why I do need one.  Then, I brought up that he didn't need to buy a guitar and he said that he does *need* it.  He started calling me horrible names, and said I need to be supportive of his dreams to become a rockstar.  I told him that we live in the real world and need to survive first.    

Eventually I left to have a smoke out of the ash tray and was standing in the doorway, while he was yelling at me.  He said I drain him dry of money, ignoring that for most of the relationship I spend most of my paycheck buying him drugs.  He got pissed off I was having a smoke and demanded I get out of doorway, I told him my parents don't care where I smoke and I pay my rent.  It was like his eyes turned black.  He charged towards me and pushed me out of the room, he raised his hand and he smacked my arm hard, knocking the cigarette out of my hand and trying to slam the door in my face.  I pushed the door open and he cornered me against the door frame and hit my arm again.  I broke down crying. 

He told me to drop the crying act, that I brought it on myself by riling him up.  He called me some of the most foulest things I've heard in my life.  He said he couldn't believe he fell in love with someone like me.  Later when he calmed down he went to bed.  He promised he'd never do it again and apologised when I brought it up.  I feel shitty that I took him in when he was homeless, that I helped him out with money, helped him get a job and he does that to me.  I already have one permanent injury from a previous abusive relationship, I'm so scared of being stalked, lied about and harassed again.",domesticviolence
Advice for making videos on YT about my DV so I can save others. Since I ignored the warning signs &amp; almost seen black after he choked me out,"I want to start a channel where I talk about the last 5.5 years. The little good that masked me to ALL the bad. The warning signs &amp; more. I want to save anyone woman or male; that is stuck or feels trapped, like I did. I make my great escape tomorrow. He doesn’t even realize I snapped out of it yet. I just wouldn’t want to show my face of who I actually am until I was ready. I want to sit in front of the camera though. Is there any ideas of how I could mask who I am until I was brave enough to show who I am? I don’t expect to get tons of followers, but if I saved someone just ONE person who came across my videos, it’s worth it. I just want to hide who I am so people in my town (New Jersey) don’t know the extent of trauma I went through, until I know I won’t be treated like a victim or be pitied, I want to rise above all this &amp; show how with time, you heal. Cause I know I’m being brave now but I will have weak moments of confusion &amp; miss him even, but I will stay strong. So any ideas would be greatly appreciate!!! -TL❤️❤️",domesticviolence
"Sleep Struggles, dreams and flashbacks, any advice?",I’ve had reoccurring dreams on and off for about 7 years now.  The dreams are based on snippets of domestic and sexual violence with my ex-partner.   There are times when arguments with my now husband may trigger some elements of bad memories which doesn’t help.  I’m wondering if anyone has any techniques they could perhaps recommend for calming down after a nasty nightmare or night terror?  They are very frightening for me still.  I wake up and still feel like I’m living it and find it very hard to calm myself down enough again to sleep.  I rarely get flashbacks during the day; although this may be because I seem to be better at controlling them now.  Any suggestions would be gratefully received.,domesticviolence
"I'm probably, most definitely being stupid","So I had posted about a week ago. Sorry, new to reddit so I don't know how to add a link to it. 
Long story short... Husband (42 M)and I (39 F) bickered. Neither of us have ever been physically aggressive with each other before, but I grabbed his arm out of anger. He didn't talk to me for over 2 weeks and finally responded by waking me from a dead sleep to yell at me, spit in my face, tell me he wanted a divorce, choke me (super briefly), hit me in the face, punch a mirror, yell at me some more, take my ring, and then acted like I was doing something wrong for packing a bag and leaving the house. 

So, update is...the next day I waited for him to get home (with pepper spray hidden in my hand) from work and told him that we needed to talk on the weekend. Our schedules are pretty opposite so it is easy to avoid each other. There was an apology and an ""I'm a piece of shit"" but I told him I was tired and we'd talk later that weekend. Slept with a tire thumper in my bed that week in case. He was pretty much living in the basement. 

So the weekend comes. I come downstairs to talk. He just puts his arms out to hug me. I do. We lay there for a while. End up having sex several times, but never talked about anything really. The next day (yesterday), things feel good. We have a good morning together. We decide to go out for a late lunch. I am big on pictures so I take one of us. After a nice lunch we go to leave. In the car he asks to see the photo. I show him and he hits the back button and all photos come up. Well I had taken pictures of my pea sized bruise and the broken mirror. He says, ""oh what's that?"". 
Now I wanted to work things out, but that doesn't mean I was back to a point where I am comfortable that he isn't going to overreact to things. So I grabbed my phone, said they were just selfies. I took a few minutes to breathe and compose myself then tell him what they really were. Well he had obviously already figured that out. He is now pissed at me again because I tried to hide it. Says it is fucked up that I was trying to be secretive and what else am I going to be secretive about basically. 
He ended up retreating to the basement again when we got home. I was just enjoying the day after 3 weeks of hell and didn't want to spoil it. But because I took several minutes to tell the truth, apparently I'm in the wrong. 
I'm still in love, but I think I'm being stupid.",domesticviolence

Its my brother,"I’m a bit younger than my brother and we usually have a pretty good relationship until he gets mad. Im a girl, so I can’t stand up to him and make him stop hurting me and punching me. The worst part is that he is completely blind to my emotions, even though I’ve told him numerous times that what he’s doing is too much. It’s been like this for years, I absolutely hate him, but I don’t hate him at the same time. He is often my only friend (we have a lot in common). He is angry only for a couple minutes, I run away, cry for hours, but he is fine in just seconds. I just wish I didn’t wake up the next morning. If I try ignoring him, because I don’t want to talk to him, when the rest of my family comes back home, he’ll speak for me and say that I’m in my bad mood. My BaD mOoooD. He laughs.

So I ran with my four children in the middle of the night to get away from my abusive husband. My friend picked us up and took us two hours and 45 mins away to her house to be safe. I have a preemie who is 7 pounds now ..a two year old...9 year old...and 12 year old. Apparently in the midst of grabbing everything from the house I forgot my wic Similac neosure for my baby and I just ran COMPLETELY out and no money to buy any and I honestly do not know what to do..I'm so scared. My friend who we moved in with is out of funds and I have no family. I called the pediatricians around here and none have any samples and hospital says they have a shortage for labor and delivery only right now. I am at a loss and so scared...anyone have any ideas because I'm out of all...oh the two local food banks here do not have ANY formula...idk I need prayers and help

I just want to give up but I know I can not do that because I am all that my four babies have. Especially now that I left and pretty much us 5 is all we have.. we have no other family and the only friend that we have is the one that is allowing us to live with her until we can get on our feet to get our own house. 

I just feel so hopeless and useless because I cannot even provide for my own children what kind of mother am I? Maybe I shouldn't have left or maybe I should go back and just deal with it for the well being of my children I do not know what to do or what to think I honestly just feel like a failure what I mean is I have failed as a mother... A wife..and  just a woman in general!! 

I CALLED SIMILAC AND THEY ARE GOING TO SEND ME SOME FORMULA BUT IT TAKES AROUND 14 DAYS TO PROCESS THE ORDER THEN THEY SHIP IT OUT SO THE LADY ON THE PHONE SAID I CAN EXPECT IT AROUND 20 TO 30 DAYS OR A MONTH PRETTY MUCH. I ALSO CALLED WIC TWICE ACTUALLY, AND TALK TO TWO DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND EXPLAINED MY SITUATION AND THEY CHECKED AND THEY HAVE NO SAMPLES OR EXTRAS OF ANY KIND OF FORMULA.  THEY GAVE ME THE SOONEST APPOINTMENT THEY COULD WHICH IS THIS COMING THURSDAY. BUT I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT SOMETHING NOW BECAUSE WE ARE COMPLETELY OUT OF THE SIMILAC NEOSURE NOW. I HAVE NONE TO GIVE MY SON SO I HAVE BEEN CALLING MESSAGING AND DOING EVERYTHING I CAN THINK OF TO AT LEAST COME UP WITH THE $24 TO BUY A CAN TO AT LEAST LAST TILL WIC APPOINTMENT THURSDAY. 

I HAD ASKED ALL MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY THE LOAN ME SOME MONEY OR TO EVEN SEND A VIRTUAL GIFT CARD AND I TOLD THEM I WOULD PAY THEM BACK FRIDAY AT MIDNIGHT TRIPLE THE AMOUNT. WHICH PRETTY MUCH MEANS THAT FOR $25 I WAS OFFERING TO GIVE THEM $75 AND THE LAST 2 PEOPLE I ASKED I TOLD THEM I WOULD PAY THEM BACK $100 FOR THE 25 AND NO SUCCESS YET BUT I CAN'T GIVE UP I HAVE TO FIGURE THIS OUT ASAP.",domesticviolence
"Why do so many women who, after being abused once, end up alone or having to leave yet another abuser?","Pretty much the title. It applies to myself, but also many other women I’ve known.

They’re not stupid or ignorant, and they do the best anyone could. They’re not insecure or weak. They’re looking for the same things everyone else on this planet is.

They get therapy after the first abusive relationship and “put in the work”. They wait before going into another relationship, and know the signs. They excel and are happy in every other (non-romantic/sexual) area of their lives, usually, from career to finances to developing community and close friendships. They have strong senses of self and self-esteem.

They know the warning signs, and leave partners as soon as they begin to exhibit them. They seek and listen to anything a therapist or friend might say about a new partner’s vibe, personality, treatment.

They don’t die from the abuse, because they’re strong and smart enough to walk away.

But repeatedly, at a percentage significantly higher than the general population’s, they find themselves *having* to walk away from yet another abuser. Maybe the abuser hides all signs for the first few months, or even until a proposal or marriage. The abused woman isn’t stupid, and he fooled everyone else around her as well. She learned from her mistakes the first time. She sought others’ opinions and listened to her gut. 

Yet so many of us end up with yet another abuse story. We ultimately end up “safe”, sure, as we either leave or effectively give up and remain single.

These abusers ultimately reveal—after hiding or denying it previously—past partners they abused. I wouldn’t condone victim blaming, but I’d almost like to blame myself, as that’d give me some control here. But I can’t.

So, why is the ideal outcome of finding a loving, healthy, respectful partnership with someone we’re sexually attracted to so elusive and rare for us? Are we sexually geared to only be attracted to the pheromones of an abuser? Is that physically even possible? If it’s biological, is it possible to change this? Are we all doomed to biological infertility unless we do it all on our own? Are we just permanently damaged and destined to be single, or with an abuser? Why does this keep happening? Why does it keep happening to women who were happy on their own and with everything in their lives, aware of the signs, and so on?

And please, although I know there’s a massive selection bias here, and the stats show you’re the rarer case, if you have a success story that involves a happy, healthy marriage, please do share :)",domesticviolence

He's doing better and Im crumbling,"He's Latino, Military, raised in a loving family and has 2 sisters. He did lose his parents back to back which prompted him to join the infantry and experienced life/death situation in Afghanistan. Long story short, we dated for 4 months and I noticed that his comprehension and communication went nowhere especially after he reenlisted with out telling me. We had ""rules"" to abide by, curfews. He was toxic, had a manipulative behavior, and didnt take criticism well. In a disagreement he'd throw Divorce like it was nothing. I could only shut up and cry and the cycle would repeat. He always bent rules and did things that were petty. 

Most of the times, I had to be the bigger person to stay sane and human, always forgave, with open arms. I was so confused, I asked his older sister of 7 years if his behavior was Normal (she actually worked for DV victims) what stood out to me most was her advising me to busy myself...that's how it went for 4 years

--I retaliated to be seen as equal and he'd push back--breaking my things, talking to women, distancing himself. It was agony, I begged for counseling 3 years before I gave birth to my daughter, but he had a twisted view on therapy and counselors. Fast-forward until now, I fought back verbally standing up for myself--I wanted an equal household I wanted love, I gave birth to our precious girl and I was fighting pregnancy discrimination at my work to provide for our family while he left the military to babysit our girl, I was learning how to be a new parent and still dealing with his tantrums. He did finally acknowledge he needed October 2019 help, thank God, I held onto hope and it was here thank you..... but he thought getting the help at a specific time was better--I pleaded, begged, cried---he delayed it and Beat me Jan 19 2020. A few days before my birthday, the same week our girl walked for the first time. I can forget how he grabbed my hair and slammed me into the bassinet, kicked me on thr ground twice. He boxed my ears and hit my face when he pulled me back in to explain he messed up. He wrestled me instead and the neighbors called the cops.

His military friends and many of his friends supported him through this which was great and the VA has loads of resources and help. Covid19 delayed our couples therapy and I was on the waitinglist for individual therapy, he's had his sessions and still ongoing with the VA.

Hes turning into 90% Gandhi and Im self-sabotaging, pushing him away, making it worse. All the poison he poured into me was seeping out. Ive ruined it now, I cant stop the verbal diarrhea, the paranoia and the emotions of exhaustion and fear, if he was going to revert back to his old ways. He's getting better and Im broken. After everything Ive been through with him, all I want is to be held by him and feel the safety I felt when we first met, but its mingled with fear and bitterness. He sees a positive future, but Ive ended it b/c of the anxiety Monster Ive become. Im sorry to my husband and my daughter. I felt strong those 4 years, I only needed to hold on and wait for couples therapy for a few more months, but I dont know what's happening to me internally.",domesticviolence
really need encouragement,"i forced myself to leave before mother’s day, it worked out great because i had just got on good terms with my family again and he already knew i was leaving on that saturday. i ended up having to go early because he was getting pissed at me for nothing and interrupting online school and i had to quickly call my gma so that she made sure i was home in an hour as he takes my keys/stuff away when i try to leave. anyways since i’ve been gone he’s been trying HARD to convince me to come back. apparently his attitude switched completely and now he doesn’t hold any grudges against me. he’s extremely convincing and even though i can see that he’s manipulating me my heart wants to give him another chance. i had to force myself to leave and got my gma to keep me accountable but he wants me to come over tonight. i’m really anxious about being around him again, any little thing sets him off, i don’t even have to be talking for him to be annoyed by me. i’m wondering if i should bring my gma ( i really don’t want to stress her out, she already worries about me a lot) so that i can get my stuff from his place tonight or if i should bring my male friend (this would piss him off for sure but he would be able to protect me and i wouldn’t stress my gma out) i was planning on giving him a chance but since spending time with my mom i really want to be a good example to her and leave him behind since she’s in an abusive relationship too. i appreciate any advice you guys have.

I just wanted him to comfort me or give me some encouraging words but he was on his phone and instead he got up from the bed and started yelling at me and cursing, going back and forth in the house still cursing at me and yelling then hit the bed. He told me to leave him the fuck alone so I spent the night on the couch. While all this was happening I felt like it was not real and I was watching from someone else’s point of view. I was shaking and crying for a long time. I woke up with a huge headache and I was just physically feeling sick all day. 

This morning he was apologizing asking if I was going to leave him. After work I came home and he was here telling me I’m beautiful, best thing that ever happened to him and he was sorry and if I still hated him. I never said I hated him, I told him I felt he hated me because he always talks to me like I’ve ruined his life. 
I’m laying in bed and just thinking and feeling down. He’s came to check on me but I don’t want him to touch me. I feel like I’m being too harsh but I don’t know how to feel. I know he just yelled at me and I should’ve left him alone and cried on my own.  But I can’t help feeling like this. I do so much for him and I’m always there for him during his hardships",domesticviolence
I kind of just have to talk for a second. Sorry but it's detailed and I don't own a diary!,"ALRIGHT. SO. Excuse me because I've pumped up the overtime this week and I am consequentially BUZZED.   


2013, boyfriend at the time beat me so severely I had reconstructive surgery and some titanium put into my skull to prevent my eye from falling into the back of my head because my orbital floor was blown out. He went to jail. Bonded out. I was right there with him when he bonded out. As a matter of fact, I CHALLENGED him to bond out. I didn't think he could put up the $10k. But he did. I was pregnant at the time and strung him along from July to August, just lashing out and taking my pain out on him but still seeing him frequently. Typing this, I realize how fucked up it was that he was able to come to my house and be angry during this window and the worst he did to me was throw a cup of Mountain Dew across the room out of frustration because I kicked him out after making him bring me Taco Bell (here's a key indicator that no, he doesn't have anger issues... nor issues of control). There was a lot of other abuse prior to the whole skull part but the only other significant ones were: threatening to kill me and my mom while threatening to cut off his ankle monitor and biting my head because he thought I was on Facebook but found out I actually wasn't on Facebook and also when he pinned me to the bed for 3 hours, taunting me after punching me in the face while I held my daughter and was pregnant with our own. Yikes.   


He went to prison for 6 years on a 10 year sentence. Every single parole hearing, I fought it. I told the state ""No, he does not deserve to get out. No. He does not deserve to be free."" And the state even ruled him as a ""danger to society."" Awesome. Great. I achieved all that was necessary. But I never went to therapy. I never understood trauma bonding. I didn't understand why every 18 months or every time a parole hearing came around I would send him a nasty JPay message telling him how much I hated him. But he could never respond because I blocked any and all of his incoming mail. He once even tried to send me a package of jail books that actually got through with the paperwork he received from the prison showing him that I personally requested the blockade on the mail. As if I didn't know this already.  


And then in July 2019, he paroled. He was released to the county jail on detainers from the violations of protective order from 2013.  They were dismissed due to age. I got the text at 9PM on July 26th that he was to be released from county. I called his parents looking for him. I called the jail trying to find out where he was. I messaged his instagram, the only still-standing social media and contact I had with him and I waited. I waited around for two days. Pacing. Talking to my friends, waiting for him to message me. After six. years.   


And he did. He messaged me. He proclaimed his love for me. I proclaimed my love for him. And I fell right back in again. Keep in mind, I never received any therapy. No counseling. There was no resolution for my feelings and I never knew what trauma bonding was.  


Within two to three days of seeing him again, we were drinking one night after I got off of work and I went outside to smoke some pot really quickly. He was on parole and on an ankle monitor so he couldn't come with. I came back inside and he pulled me down the hallway by my hair. He pressed it must've been because he was drunk and jealous he couldn't smoke. I honestly knew this excuse was bullshit but I wanted him back so badly because my previous six years had been absolute hell and full of promiscuity and failed relationships.  


A few days after this, while having sex, buzzed again (he doesn't have any issues with drugs or alcohol btw, I had a bit of an issue and also wanted the alcohol to ease my feelings and nervousness with him) he put his hands around my throat and I fought him off of me and scratched his face and he finally let go of my throat.  


He was good for a while... Released from prison July 27th, 2019. Only two small incidents, you know? Until August 17th, 2019. We were drinking. I blame myself for the drinking parts, honestly. But I do not blame myself for his violence. We BBQ'ed. It was an awesome time. It was fun, in fact. He let me do the BBQ'ing. I've never gotten to do that before. We put our daughter to bed who had just learned days before this that he was her father. How exciting. Six years without a dad and now you can match your stomach moles and beautiful, full lips with the man who helped create you.   


Around 12AM, quite a few drinks later. He got mad at me. I don't know for what. I can't remember for what. But I wanted to go home and I told him I wanted to go home. And he grabbed my phone. And he smashed it into the wood planked floors. And I knew exactly what was coming after that. It was the same exact thing that happened in 2013. I knew it was coming. And I still couldn't help but mouth ""Here comes 2013 (insert his name) again."" He charged me and he smacked me and I was SHOOK. I went to the bathroom and could see the bruising that aligned the inside of his finger tips above my lip. I told him I was leaving and I went to grab our daughter. I started walking to the front door and he shoved me. He shoved me so hard I fell and I instinctively moved our daughter to the side because I knew what was coming.   


He smacked me. Open hand. Over and over and over and over again. Blood flew down the hallway. Some of it as far as 4-5ft away from where my body sat upon impact. He shoved me into the bathroom and stuck our daughter on the cell phone to watch a show while I stood and bled in the shower and cried. I tried to step out in an effort to calm and comfort him because I was in pure survival mode at this point and I saw him pouring bleach down the entire hallway and cleaning up -- what was literally -- the crime scene. He bleached it like a murder scene out of a movie and I slunk back into the bathroom.  


I looked at myself in the mirror and I knew I had to do some kind of manipulation to get out of there. I put my daughter in bed, her pajamas covered in my blood. And I told her mommy was okay and we would be going home soon.  


I spent an hour convincing him that I was okay and he wasn't going back to prison and I instructed him on how to care for my wounds. I helped him get me an ice pack and inflammatory medications. And he helped dress my wounds. I convinced him to call a fellow felon and his old prison cell mate who we had just FaceTimed earlier that day. I told him if I was going to go home, this is someone he could trust and someone we could confide in to not go to the police as he was on parole as well (bank robbery, no victims). He would call his friend a few times and his friend kept trying to get through to him. My boyfriend would give me the window to start telling this guy the address and then he would hang up. He was taunting me. The friend would call again. My boyfriend finally gave me the space to say the whole address. He had to drive from 2 hours away. But he did it.  


At some point, while bloody and swollen, chunks of my hair easily brushed away from my head, he asked me ""So what's up, you wanna fuck?"" And I let him. It's so entirely fucked up but I let him right then and there. And then in the middle of it, there was a knock at the door. It was finally my saving grace, his friend. His friend tried, and I could see it, he tried to contain his horrific reaction. He stared at me and put his hand behind my back and guided me to get our daughter. He stood right behind me and in between my boyfriend and guided me to the car. We got my daughter strapped in. He helped me.  


He went back inside while I strapped in the carseat and was talking to my boyfriend. I came back in, why? I don't know. But I did. And I ran my hand through my bloody, matted hair. I got to the back of my head and a huge chunk of hair came out and onto my hand. And I handed it to my boyfriend. And said ""Here you go."" He asked me ""What? Do you want some more?"" And he laughed. He laughed at me in front of this person that was supposed to save me.  


And his friend said ""Go wait in the car."" At that moment, I was trusting my life in the hands of someone I had never met before. And the friend came and got in the car. And he drove me home. And on the way home, he told me that he had no idea of my husband's charges and that he had hidden all of his charges in prison and stated the assault he was convicted of was on a man. And then this friend told me how his father had killed his mother. And that's why he started robbing banks after being put in foster care. And he warned me. And warned me. And begged me not to return. He told me he didn't care how far the relationship went with his ex-celly, that my presence and my situation hit home for him far more and was far more important than someone he went to prison with. And I couldn't be more grateful for this man's existence. Honestly.  


Anyway so I went to the hospital after that. I had a burner phone (learned from the first time). I had called EMS and they did a transport. No broken bones, etc. Just some stitches this time, by the grace of God.  


And then on September 6th, 2019... I married him. Not the friend. But my boyfriend. I married my boyfriend that had just beaten the life out of me and I had to beg for freedom for two weeks later. I got married with two black eyes.   


And the abuse continued. Of course it continued. Why wouldn't it?  


From December 2019 to January 2020, in a 2 week period... 14 days. He had laid his hands on me and threatened to kill me 9 times.   


It was on a Sunday that he last hit me. I waited and tried to persevere all day. I was constantly having mental breakdowns at this point because of the abuse (and he would come in and be captain save this girl and skip work to help my mental state by over coddling me from the pain he had caused, really). He went to work that next Monday morning and I called into work. I told him I needed to take time and just be okay mentally and he agreed and he left for work. I packed all of his essentials into a laundry basket and set them by the door. Around 3PM that day, I told him that he would not be coming home that night and he had to stay elsewhere. He detested that idea. He insisted he at least come by to pick up essentials to stay with his mother and I told him no. I told him he was not welcome to come pick up his things and if he came, I would call the police. Because I knew at that moment, if he came home, he would either a) beat the life of out of me/kill me or b) lure me in all over again. Honestly, in hindsight, I think B would be attempted and when it wasn't applicable, A would happen.  


He then proceeded to threaten me. He told me that I was going to need my gun if I ever saw him again (I got a gun in 2017 actually to protect myself against him, again, yikes). He told me he was going to come and kill me. We had shared location settings on our iPhones (I cleaned houses all over the southern part of our state for a living and some people were sketchy, I was by myself a lot and it was a safety measure prompted by me. Although I'm sure he loved it too bc he could keep an eye on me) I could see he was on his way to me. So I called his cousin who had seen me battered and bruised in August -- coincidentally I had just been in a very bad car crash so I blamed my bruising on that when she happened upon me accidentally... But one night in the kitchen (he was paroled to her house) she told me, in front of him, that if he ever abused me, she didn't care if he was family or not, I could come to her. And she could be my safe space. So I called her that day. I told her ""Do you remember this talk we had in the kitchen? 2013 was because of me. The bruising wasn't from the car crash. And now he's on his way to kill me."" And she told me ""I'm on my way.""  


But the problem was -- she wasn't on her way. She contacted him to see where he was and he immediately drove back to work. She went to his work. WITH ALL GOOD INTENTIONS, MIND YOU. She wanted to intercept him. I get that. I understand that. And from her view -- she did. She succeeded in that and at no point in time can I fault her for this. But she never told me this. She told me she was coming to me and she lived 17 minutes away. 30 minutes passed and she never came and he was still erratically texting me and I called 911.  


The police came, and they told me they couldn't protect me and wait around all night. So they took me with them to the police station after I packed a bag. And they took a statement and in the middle of the statement is when I received a call from his cousin. She told me she was with him and that he was calm and would be staying at her house that night. And then she handed the phone to him. And my eyes bulged and I hung up. She texted me apologizing for not understanding but still.   


So unknowingly really, I made the statement against my now husband. And he's now sitting on a $175,000 bond for 2 counts of family violence, 1 count continuous family violence, a parole violation, and a violation of a protective order and honestly? I don't think he's ever coming home. I supplied the detective with multiple admissions of guilt (such as: Are you ever going to apologize for slamming my head into the ground? ::  I'm sorry).   


I don't know. I don't know why I've typed all of this. I am safe. And I know of trauma bonding now. And I know that I am severely trauma bonding and I am trying to break these holds as we speak.   


I just want to kind of put my story out there and tell you guys:  


Please. Take the resources of counseling. Take the family support. Take everything. Be as selfish and greedy as you can be in your HEALTHY recovery. Or you may end up being as selfish and greedy as I was in re-obtaining the love I once thought I had.   


Anyway thanks for letting me rant, idk.",domesticviolence

A light at the end of the tunnel... And the beginning of my life,"I was beat and raped by my ex. And I hated my life. I hated myself but it didn't really click as being a bad situation. I was with him since 11th grade in high school, I figured that's how it was. Sex just ended in pain or tears. And then my ex brought his friend home. And me and that friend bonded over his dog (I'm obsessed with dogs). For some reason the friend started staying the night on the couch downstairs. And I relished those days because I wouldn't be hurt. And slowly the abuse happened less and less because that friend stayed five plus nights a week on average. And then in a mall parking lot, I realized... I needed help, and I was getting it from that friend. He knew I would be safe while he was there. That my ex wouldn't hurt me when he was there.... 

It's going to be our third wedding anniversary in September. My husband saved me from my ex. Now we care for each other every day. Working with each other's trauma (his ex is almost as bad). We grow together. There was light at the end of my tunnel. I just didn't see it until the very end.",domesticviolence

Seeking advice on financial aspects of leaving an abusive husband,"Financially dependent on abuser, ways to leave

I’m posting this for a friend. 
My friend (47) has been abused by her husband (60) for the last 25 years. He’s a narcissist with anger issues who sees himself as a victim in his own life. He’s incredibly verbally, emotionally financially and sexually abusive. He isolated her when she was 23 and he was in his late 30s. He’s taken up the best years of her life and if she doesn’t leave she will either kill herself or the stress will kill her. She lives in MN but she is originally from Turkey. She’s a citizen. She had 4 children, most of whom are adults. The younger two are in high school or going to college. The husband threatens to not pay for their college if she leaves them and he tells tha children. Her youngest has anxiety and is always worried that her mother is going to leave her behind or that she won’t get to go to college. She has places to go but doesn’t feel like she can leave. She has no self esteem and no degree. She’s financially dependent on him and so are her children. If there was a way that she could safely leave and have some financial leverage from him she would.  The situation is much more complex than this obviously and her plan is to leave in two years when her youngest will be going to college but that’s too far away and she’s getting worse everyday. What would you suggest?",domesticviolence
My (44f) partner (44m) attacked me during a verbal argument -- he says it's because I was arguing and wouldn't shut up while he was stressed.,"I don't know what to do. We were arguing (we were both frustrated by something we were doing, but he was admittedly a lot more sleep deprived than me). I was very frustrated both with the task at hand and him. I felt that he wasn't being reasonable with regards to the situation (he was trying to complete something that just wasn't working out, and he was spending hours on it) plus he was expecting me to help him endlessly and I was getting very frustrated.

&amp;#x200B;

A verbal argument erupted and it just didn't go well. I don't even recall exactly what was being said, but he was shouting at me and I was telling him that the project was never going to work out (I was being realistic but not very supportive). I don't know what was said that made him snap, but he came over and grabbed my arm, hard. He's grabbed me before and we agreed he would never put his hands on me again, so I pushed him back off me. He then head-butted me in the forehead.

&amp;#x200B;

It really hurt and (3 days later) I still have headaches. He did apologize but told me it was also my fault for escalating the fight when he was stressed and sleep deprived. 

&amp;#x200B;

I *want* to let it go. I want to accept his apology and his promises that this will never happen again, and accept that I had a hand in it by being horrible when he was so tired and stressed out. But as I look at the bruise on my forehead, I'm not sure if I should. I can't see this clearly -- how serious is this?

tldr: I argued with my partner while he was in a vulnerable position (tired and stressed) and he head-butted me.",domesticviolence
Chrome retains your information on any device you have logged in on in the past and keeps current browsing history - in case you have a stalker ex,"Hi all,

I got out my iPad, which has been in a cabinet for at least a few years, opened the Chrome app, and opened a new tab. It showed me my browsing history, and it showed me my ex-husband's browsing history for over a year or two, even current stuff by month. I haven't seen him for six months. 

Apparently he had logged in with his work gmail account on my iPad at some point in the past, years ago, and I had access to everything current and past, including his coworker's login to zoom with password already entered (I can't read the password but I could just hit login and be in his account). 

I had a friend help me log out of my ex's account and then clear the history, but I wanted to let you know that if you have a stalker or someone who would and could use this information, this is a huge vulnerability. If you have used a device to log in to chrome, that device retains the information - even current information - if you are using a different device. 

Here is more information from Google Chrome on how to clear your login history, I'm not sure if this will help with a device you don't have access to now, but I'd start here:

I cleared his history off that, as well. 

If you know more technical information on clearing browsing history and login accounts on shared devices, please do share it. Fortunately my ex isn't a stalker, nor am I, but it was a bit startling. I immediately thought others should know about this for their safety.",domesticviolence

I am desperate for advice..,"Looking for some advice... my husband and I have been married for 1 year together for 6 years. After we got married I saw a decline in him. He has OCD and can become very obsessed with things, he’s either all in or not in at all. He started smoking weed about a month before we got married and quickly became obsessed. Spending $400 a mo or more on weed. Smoking almost everyday. He started going to work high, family events, etc. I talked to him and explained I didn’t care if he smoked but he needs to do it in moderation. This did not happen. A few months after smoking he started to complain about how unhappy he is at his job which he has been there for 3 years. Now it’s unbearable for him. He won’t look for another job and has just stayed with his current one. When he gets a work call or has to go in we will get very angry and throw things and yell. I can see that he is depressed. Around November I think he got a antidepressant and has been taking it constantly but I’ve seen no change. He gets it from our family doctor and does not see a psychiatrist or therapist. Things are just continuing to escalate. I have a feeling he might be bi polar. We will have really great days even weeks followed by really really bad days. There’s no in between it’s either really good or really bad. In December he had a bad day and was in a horrible mood I went to talk to him and he got up ran to me picked me up choked me and slammed me on the table. I was shocked. He left so angry that night he finally came back and did not apologize until the next day. I did forgive him hoping he would change. Things only got worse. He works 9-5 and will go to sleep at 7:30 or 8. He hardly eats. He’s lost 20 pounds in 5 months which is a lot of him. He’s 6’2 and usually weighs about 175ish. Things upset him very easily. A few days ago we got into a huge fight. I’ve been dealing with the negativity for months now trying to support him and love him even though I always get pushed away. It really starts to wear down on you. He had a really ugly attitude and I just lost it and got upset with him just telling him to leave and I followed him to the garage as he was leaving yelling at him. I know I shouldn’t have it was wrong of me but I snapped. He turned around and lunges at me and put me in a chockehold for what felt like forever. He then punched the door and broke it. I have never felt so scared.
He’s punched 3 doors, dented our fridge by punching it, broke a trash can by throwing it. 
He started a new thing when he gets upset where he punches himself in the face even gave himself a bruise. 
I am so freaking lost. This is not the man I married. I have my faults. I’m not claiming to be innocent. But I do not physically harm him when I’m upset. 
I have stressed to him that he needs professional help and that I will love him through it but he won’t. I’ve gotten his parents and brother involved but nothing has changed. 
I honestly don’t know what to do and I’m scared for the next time he gets upset. 
I love him he’s my bestfriend but when he gets upset or is having a low day I don’t know who he is... 
This is a lot to type. I’m sure I’ve forgotten somethings. I just need someone to point me in the right direction. 

I would also like to add he is consistently talking about killing himself and how much he hates his life. When someone you love says this all the time for months it begins to wear down on you. I also want to add that I do try to comfort him but he won’t let me it only makes things worse.",domesticviolence

“You enjoyed stabbing me in the face”,"I am posting this because I want to document it. I don’t know where else to put it. My husband was shit-faced drunk and was lying upstairs on the floor. I let him sit for about 30 minutes and then checked on him. I asked if he wanted something to eat and then I brought him a piece of toast and some water. I then left him alone for another 30 minutes and then came back and tried to get ready for bed. He then pinned me down and tried to strangle me. I laughed at first because I didn’t know what to do and figured he was fine.

I then started feeling like I couldn’t breathe. I was in the middle of flossing my teeth so I tried to jam my flosser in his face. He laid off and went away. I laid there for a few minutes and then went on getting ready for bed. He then said “you enjoyed stabbing me in the face, right?”. I have given him the silent treatment since.

He has said “are you so mad that you’re trying to kill the cats” and “did you mean what you meant downstairs” and “they don’t deserve to be involved with this” as ways to attempt to manipulate my emotions. None of this is real.

Get out now??

I love this man. We have been married for almost a year. We have been together for almost six years. I love our life together, and I couldn’t imagine my life any differently. I really don’t want to leave because I am usually so happy with him.

But I think if I have a friend help who won’t charge much- we can make $122 work to Fix it. I need gas to get to either North Carolina to his family who knows everything &amp; will protect me while helping him (he won’t know I’m out of our state) or I can go to Florida to my sister &amp; her gram. I just need to pay to get there. Food for Ride, gas &amp; a hotel for a night maybe two depending on where I choose to go. I can’t knock it out in a day being the only driver. I don’t know how I can get money, $, to leave by Tuesday when that’s my only day I can leave in secrecy. Any help to make fast cash will be appreciated &amp; repaid when I’m on my feet, please no scams. I don’t want to post all my proof here that includes last names of my family. I’ll scratch last names out of photos. But this is all my life. I wish I was lying. I love him, he is only here for our daughter he does nothing for besides traumatize her. She’s scared of loud noises &amp; it’s cause of him. 
Ps getting pfa morning before I leave, I pray i can Tuesday... pray for us please. He takes my phone sometimes when he senses something. So here’s to making it to Tuesday with a phone &amp; money to leave before he snaps again &amp; doesn’t stop.

Domestic Violence Advocates Subreddit and Resources,"Hello! I (22M) am a Victims Advocate for a domestic violence emergency shelter in the Midwest and I was looking for resources the help workers in this field cope with the vicarious trauma that is an occupational hazard for dv workers, ideally I was hoping there was a Subreddit for dv advocates to identify with others who understand how difficult and heart wrenching providing hotline and crisis services can be. Please let me know if y'all know of anything like this! 

Additionally, if you are experiencing domestic violence and want to talk about it or need resources for shelters or outreach programs in the Midwest (Missouri area) feel free to dm me",domesticviolence
My Brother beats me up.,"My brother beats me up and blackmails me when I try to complain (the blackmails consist of my brother asking my father to not buy a ps4 pro or a ps5 for me which I will buy later this year.

Witnessing domestic abuse as a young teen [TRIGGER WARNING],"Hello everyone,

I am not sure if this is the place I could post about my situation, because I have not really been the one that's gone through the physical abuse part, but I was a witness of it for a few years back when I was younger. I'm 20 now. When I was about 14, my dad started physically and emotionally abusing my mother, the emotional abuse had actually started way before that, but that's when it escalated to something else. 

I remember a lot of things very vividly. A lot of things I've heard that I should not have, I've seen a lot of things I shouldn't have. The abuse had started because my dad was a very jealous and possessive guy (what a surprise) and always had suspicions that my mom was cheating on him. So one day he brutally beats her up, parts of her hair were missing, she had a lot of bruises and was almost unrecognisable, avoiding to look at me. Many adults knew about the abuse from day 1 and no one offered a hand. I'm not saying I'm the victim here, obviously it's my mom that had it the worst. But it just breaks my heart and leaves me very conflicted about everything in my life. 

My father had been locking my mom, beating her, blackmailing her, throwing things at her, taking all her documents (because he was afraid she would run away or leave the country), he had made her write in a notebook about all her sexual encounters and then made her read it to us, while he would hit her after every sentence that he gets annoyed by. He threatened to cut her in parts and send her to her mom if she tries to run away or do anything without his permission. He drove all of us in a car while being completely drunk and hitting her while driving. 

I am COMPLETELY devastated and I really have no clue about what to do with myself. Not sure if therapy works, it always ends up being about me forgiving my father. And I am really not capable of that. I can't forgive a monster that ruined all of my family members' lives. I can't live with this.

I can't even fully have him out of my life, because they are still together (the physical abuse is not happening anymore), but I can't pretend to not remember anything and it's sort of made me get distanced from my mother as well. And I have so many things to tell her. That I've always been on her side, that I'll always protect her as much as I can and I want to say sorry for everything she's gone through. I'm also sorry if she sees him in me and that creates a bigger distance between us. But I understand it. 

I am so sorry, mom.",domesticviolence
Feeling forced to press charges &amp; potentially pregnant by my abuser,"Me[25F] and my ex[31M] had been together for about 9/10 years. I left him about 2 weeks ago. It’s been draining for me and right now I don’t see the light at the end of the tunnel. I feel sick without him, like my chest caves in every time I think about the fact that we’re over. I’m in a really tough situation right now because I think that I may be pregnant. While I was with him he would sometimes either beat me until I almost blacked out or waited until I was sleep to have unprotected sex with me. A year ago when I secretly got on birth control that didn’t go well and he made me stop taking it. I ended up getting pregnant and I miscarried at 10 weeks. I didn’t know I was pregnant until I miscarries. Ever since then he would have unprotected sex with me while I was sleep or almost unconscious. It’s really weird and traumatizing having to wake up to that. 

I have not taken a pregnancy test but I am sure I’m most likely pregnant. I have already had an abortion when I was 16 on top of the miscarriage last year. I am a red to get another abortion. I feel like karma or something will happen in the future when I do want kids By the right person. I still love him but I know it’s dumb to have a kid by him right now. I feel like another abortion is gonna cause issues. 

I am currently at my moms house and I told her about me potentially being pregnant and she was upset and disappointed. She’s been basically ignoring me since I’ve been here and I am scared of how she’ll react if I tell her that I want an abortion. I feel like I sound like a little girl but I really would like the support of my mother during this time. She’s very judgemental when it comes to things like this. Plus I disobeyed her trying to and ran away with him when I turned 18 after dealing with him as a teen. She told me not to repeatedly but I didn’t listen. 

I feel like I put myself in a stupid situation. My mom says that if I don’t press charges on him while I still have “proof” (bruises, scars, etc.) then I will have to leave. I understand but I am just not ready to do that. I don’t want to press charges just yet. I’m not planning on going back to him but I’m not in the right headspace  to do all of this.

I just feel like this heartbreak won’t ever end. He’s called me numerous times and his last text said that he’ll give me my space but we’re goin got talk. I haven’t responded to him. I’m thinking about showing my mom that I haven’t spoken to him and that I’ll block his number. Just to give her some faith that I won’t go back and hopefully she’ll get off my back about making a report.

I guess I just needed to vent because I don’t have a specific question but I would appreciate any advice.",domesticviolence
Living with a schizophrenic as a child,,domesticviolence
Preparing for moving forward,"I’m trying to put some ducks in a row and trying to figure out what all I should do. My husband has been verbally abusive for years. I have little pieces of evidence, but not much. For my own mental health and for the safety of my kids, I need full custody. 

Do I absolutely have to get a lawyer? Do I need to file some form of police report first? Is the emotional abuse enough?",domesticviolence
A co-worker and victim,"I work with a woman who dated my abusive ex's brother. I'm still working with her, after dumping my ex, I see that she's an amazing worker, kind and polite, but deep down I'm so scared of her. She was with my ex's brother for a few months, she hung out around our shared apartment and at that time she was very unkind and impolite. But when I think about that time, the things I saw as unkind were blown out of proportion by my ex and his brother. Like we were being pitted against one another. They wanted me to hate her. I feel so much anxiety talking to her, so much doubt about what she's saying about the abuse she faced. I don't know how to deal with it. I never want to doubt her, or victim shame her, yet i feel conditioned to do so. I want to share our experience and bond over it but at the same time I'm very scared of it and find myself projecting onto her, and suffering from the way my ex treated her and his brother did. She tries to talk to me, she's kind and curious. Asking thoughtful questions, and it scares me, and I'm sick of it. This is mostly a rant, but if anyone can just say kind words or help me I'd really appreciate it. Thanks.",domesticviolence
Still not sleeping?,"As I lay awake at a miserable 2:30 am, reflecting on every event with such impeccable detail as I do every night, I wonder when it is I wont have this torrent of information forced at me like a miserable waterfall intent on drowning me in the evening. I don’t want to remember every detail, yet going to court has almost hammered this habit in to me where I must describe it all despite the amount of pain I was in.

I feel as though court itself can cause even more trauma. Having to be choked out by whatever spineless lawyer takes their case, defends them, and actively tries to attack you. This new behavior of recalling everything, dates, times, action and reactions has a play by play running through my head every evening until I cry and eventually fall asleep. Recollection I understand, but to have so much apprehension of events that haven’t happened yet? Even worse. “What if I have to court for xyz, what points do I make? I need to make a list of everything so I don’t miss anything like I did before.”

But the thing is... I’m not there anymore. I had gotten rid of my abuser in October. So why is it I can’t shake it now? Why do I dread going to sleep every night if the real nightmare is over? I have tried sleep medication after sleep medication. I have tried some mild anxiety medication. I have to know when I can sleep normally.

I haven’t slept well for years with them, but being able to sleep in my own bed without being forced to sleep on the couch was something I had looked forward to. How long does it take to feel safe again, to really feel peaceful, if any of you have that experience?

On another note, I know quarantine has been shifting behavior, but I have been scared to leave my house. Not feeling outright fear but my heart races and I’m worried the confidence I had built is slowly diminishing, it was something I had a problem with when I first left my situation because I thought I would run in to him and whatever “consequences” I would get for getting him in trouble. Has anyone been struggling with this as well?",domesticviolence
"Do you think some people, men, would not develop their aggression and turn into violent monsters if they've had met the right person?","My partner never loved me. I developed codependency and he defends himself as being to weak to break with me. We have hardly speak in very beginning of our relationship. He would take newspapers immediately when we would sit at coffee table. He never wanted to learn more about me. Everything I would say was  annoying to him. Decade forward and we truly hate each other. Our relationship is dead, he is abusive, we can't separate due to financial reasons, for this very moment, but probably will soon. 

He met another woman with whom he's total opposite of what he was with me. Charming, talks with her eight hours a day. Likes her jokes, personality, appearance. I wonder, how would he respond if they met sooner and if he lived with her instead of me. Would she react differently to his temper tantrums? Would she calm him down in a way I can't? Would he take effort in not hurting her due to strong feelings of attachment, love and respect? How is this going? Do wrong people who stay together make each other worse and turn one another into violent assholes? Do right people uplift you and make you better and change your personality into something that's socially acceptable?

What can you say from your experience? Was your relationship steady and healthy, with respect and love in beginning? Did it have solid grounds? Do you know people who were violent in one relationship and normal in the another one?",domesticviolence
I decided to keep count of everything my BF does,"Friday, May 15 2020: 
My boyfriend and i got into an argument over getting a new car, when I told him I believed he had already made up his mind, he told me “no seas pendeja.” He then grabbed the pen I was using, looked at me and started stabbing the notebook several times while screaming. 
He apologized hours later, after I confronted him. 

May 21, 2020 
My boyfriend started freaking out when the new car’s check engine light was on. He threw his phone after I told him to calm down. I then told him afterwards that I was just trying to lighten the mood, he then said “you could’ve done that earlier” the rest of the trip was silent

I don't want him to go back to jail.

Bestie wants to take him for everything and I know if she's successful he will get a few years. I can't bare the thought of him going away again. I feel for his kids. I love them and I want to give them the world. I love him too, even after everything. How do we turn that off? I just want him back and I wish it all never happened.

I've been in contact with his mother and I feel guilty for trying to support her attempt to keep him out while also being there for Bestie.

I just want to hug him and know how he is doing in his head and tell him I don't hate him.",domesticviolence
Protective order violation?,"It’s been two and a half months since his misdemeanor assault charges. He was left off on a lower sentence with probation because this was a first guilty assault offense. I already have a protective order in place. Now he has violated it and the magistrate has formally charged him with a violation. This also violates his probation for his assault charge where he should be facing jail time.

1. Probation violation
2. Protective order violation

How likely is it he will face jail time? Court is next month (assuming he doesn’t push it back a couple months of course). I can’t bring myself to go but since the magistrate is charging and there are already three witness statements (me, someone with me, and the owner of the location who asked him to leave and he refused) I don’t think I will need to go and it isn’t worth the added trauma.

Have any of you had success when it comes to these circumstances? He has gotten off easy on everything. I hate to see that the court protects him again.",domesticviolence

There's clearly no hope for this relationship and I know that, but I panic when I imagine my life without him.

Angry and Confused with my Sister,[deleted],domesticviolence
Escape plan into Europe review .,[removed],domesticviolence
He's doing better and Im crumbling,"He's Latino, Military, raised in a loving family and has 2 sisters. He did lose his parents back to back which prompted him to join the infantry and experienced life/death situation in Afghanistan. Long story short, we dated for 4 months and I noticed that his comprehension and communication went nowhere especially after he reenlisted with out telling me. We had ""rules"" to abide by, curfews. He was toxic, had a manipulative behavior, and didnt take criticism well. In a disagreement he'd throw Divorce like it was nothing. I could only shut up and cry and the cycle would repeat. He always bent rules and did things that were petty. 

Most of the times, I had to be the bigger person to stay sane and human, always forgave, with open arms. I was so confused, I asked his older sister of 7 years if his behavior was Normal (she actually worked for DV victims) what stood out to me most was her advising me to busy myself...that's how it went for 4 years

--I retaliated to be seen as equal and he'd push back--breaking my things, talking to women, distancing himself. It was agony, I begged for counseling 3 years before I gave birth to my daughter, but he had a twisted view on therapy and counselors. Fast-forward until now, I fought back verbally standing up for myself--I wanted an equal household I wanted love, I gave birth to our precious girl and I was fighting pregnancy discrimination at my work to provide for our family while he left the military to babysit our girl, I was learning how to be a new parent and still dealing with his tantrums. He did finally acknowledge he needed October 2019 help, thank God, I held onto hope and it was here thank you..... but he thought getting the help at a specific time was better--I pleaded, begged, cried---he delayed it and Beat me Jan 19 2020. A few days before my birthday, the same week our girl walked for the first time. I can forget how he grabbed my hair and slammed me into the bassinet, kicked me on thr ground twice. He boxed my ears and hit my face when he pulled me back in to explain he messed up. He wrestled me instead and the neighbors called the cops.

His military friends and many of his friends supported him through this which was great and the VA has loads of resources and help. Covid19 delayed our couples therapy and I was on the waitinglist for individual therapy, he's had his sessions and still ongoing with the VA.

Hes turning into 90% Gandhi and Im self-sabotaging, pushing him away, making it worse. All the poison he poured into me was seeping out. Ive ruined it now, I cant stop the verbal diarrhea, the paranoia and the emotions of exhaustion and fear, if he was going to revert back to his old ways. He's getting better and Im broken. After everything Ive been through with him, all I want is to be held by him and feel the safety I felt when we first met, but its mingled with fear and bitterness. He sees a positive future, but Ive ended it b/c of the anxiety Monster Ive become. Im sorry to my husband and my daughter. I felt strong those 4 years, I only needed to hold on and wait for couples therapy for a few more months, but I dont know what's happening to me internally.",domesticviolence
really need encouragement,"i forced myself to leave before mother’s day, it worked out great because i had just got on good terms with my family again and he already knew i was leaving on that saturday. i ended up having to go early because he was getting pissed at me for nothing and interrupting online school and i had to quickly call my gma so that she made sure i was home in an hour as he takes my keys/stuff away when i try to leave. anyways since i’ve been gone he’s been trying HARD to convince me to come back. apparently his attitude switched completely and now he doesn’t hold any grudges against me. he’s extremely convincing and even though i can see that he’s manipulating me my heart wants to give him another chance. i had to force myself to leave and got my gma to keep me accountable but he wants me to come over tonight. i’m really anxious about being around him again, any little thing sets him off, i don’t even have to be talking for him to be annoyed by me. i’m wondering if i should bring my gma ( i really don’t want to stress her out, she already worries about me a lot) so that i can get my stuff from his place tonight or if i should bring my male friend (this would piss him off for sure but he would be able to protect me and i wouldn’t stress my gma out) i was planning on giving him a chance but since spending time with my mom i really want to be a good example to her and leave him behind since she’s in an abusive relationship too. i appreciate any advice you guys have.

I can’t get over him yelling at me,"Firstly I know that a lot of people go through way worse than me and I’m sorry you have to deal with horrible things... 


Last night was bad.. my partner started yelling at me because I was sad over my grandma being hospitalized and possibly not going to make it. I just wanted him to comfort me or give me some encouraging words but he was on his phone and instead he got up from the bed and started yelling at me and cursing, going back and forth in the house still cursing at me and yelling then hit the bed. He told me to leave him the fuck alone so I spent the night on the couch. While all this was happening I felt like it was not real and I was watching from someone else’s point of view. I was shaking and crying for a long time. I woke up with a huge headache and I was just physically feeling sick all day. 

This morning he was apologizing asking if I was going to leave him. After work I came home and he was here telling me I’m beautiful, best thing that ever happened to him and he was sorry and if I still hated him. I never said I hated him, I told him I felt he hated me because he always talks to me like I’ve ruined his life. 
I’m laying in bed and just thinking and feeling down. He’s came to check on me but I don’t want him to touch me. I feel like I’m being too harsh but I don’t know how to feel. I know he just yelled at me and I should’ve left him alone and cried on my own.  But I can’t help feeling like this.

I kind of just have to talk for a second. Sorry but it's detailed and I don't own a diary!,"ALRIGHT. SO. Excuse me because I've pumped up the overtime this week and I am consequentially BUZZED.   


2013, boyfriend at the time beat me so severely I had reconstructive surgery and some titanium put into my skull to prevent my eye from falling into the back of my head because my orbital floor was blown out. He went to jail. Bonded out. I was right there with him when he bonded out. As a matter of fact, I CHALLENGED him to bond out. I didn't think he could put up the $10k. But he did. I was pregnant at the time and strung him along from July to August, just lashing out and taking my pain out on him but still seeing him frequently. Typing this, I realize how fucked up it was that he was able to come to my house and be angry during this window and the worst he did to me was throw a cup of Mountain Dew across the room out of frustration because I kicked him out after making him bring me Taco Bell (here's a key indicator that no, he doesn't have anger issues... nor issues of control). There was a lot of other abuse prior to the whole skull part but the only other significant ones were: threatening to kill me and my mom while threatening to cut off his ankle monitor and biting my head because he thought I was on Facebook but found out I actually wasn't on Facebook and also when he pinned me to the bed for 3 hours, taunting me after punching me in the face while I held my daughter and was pregnant with our own. Yikes.   


He went to prison for 6 years on a 10 year sentence. Every single parole hearing, I fought it. I told the state ""No, he does not deserve to get out. No. He does not deserve to be free."" And the state even ruled him as a ""danger to society."" Awesome. Great. I achieved all that was necessary. But I never went to therapy. I never understood trauma bonding. I didn't understand why every 18 months or every time a parole hearing came around I would send him a nasty JPay message telling him how much I hated him. But he could never respond because I blocked any and all of his incoming mail. He once even tried to send me a package of jail books that actually got through with the paperwork he received from the prison showing him that I personally requested the blockade on the mail. As if I didn't know this already.  


And then in July 2019, he paroled. He was released to the county jail on detainers from the violations of protective order from 2013.  They were dismissed due to age. I got the text at 9PM on July 26th that he was to be released from county. I called his parents looking for him. I called the jail trying to find out where he was. I messaged his instagram, the only still-standing social media and contact I had with him and I waited. I waited around for two days. Pacing. Talking to my friends, waiting for him to message me. After six. years.   


And he did. He messaged me. He proclaimed his love for me. I proclaimed my love for him. And I fell right back in again. Keep in mind, I never received any therapy. No counseling. There was no resolution for my feelings and I never knew what trauma bonding was.  


Within two to three days of seeing him again, we were drinking one night after I got off of work and I went outside to smoke some pot really quickly. He was on parole and on an ankle monitor so he couldn't come with. I came back inside and he pulled me down the hallway by my hair. He pressed it must've been because he was drunk and jealous he couldn't smoke. I honestly knew this excuse was bullshit but I wanted him back so badly because my previous six years had been absolute hell and full of promiscuity and failed relationships.  


A few days after this, while having sex, buzzed again (he doesn't have any issues with drugs or alcohol btw, I had a bit of an issue and also wanted the alcohol to ease my feelings and nervousness with him) he put his hands around my throat and I fought him off of me and scratched his face and he finally let go of my throat.  


He was good for a while... Released from prison July 27th, 2019. Only two small incidents, you know? Until August 17th, 2019. We were drinking. I blame myself for the drinking parts, honestly. But I do not blame myself for his violence. We BBQ'ed. It was an awesome time. It was fun, in fact. He let me do the BBQ'ing. I've never gotten to do that before. We put our daughter to bed who had just learned days before this that he was her father. How exciting. Six years without a dad and now you can match your stomach moles and beautiful, full lips with the man who helped create you.   


Around 12AM, quite a few drinks later. He got mad at me. I don't know for what. I can't remember for what. But I wanted to go home and I told him I wanted to go home. And he grabbed my phone. And he smashed it into the wood planked floors. And I knew exactly what was coming after that. It was the same exact thing that happened in 2013. I knew it was coming. And I still couldn't help but mouth ""Here comes 2013 (insert his name) again."" He charged me and he smacked me and I was SHOOK. I went to the bathroom and could see the bruising that aligned the inside of his finger tips above my lip. I told him I was leaving and I went to grab our daughter. I started walking to the front door and he shoved me. He shoved me so hard I fell and I instinctively moved our daughter to the side because I knew what was coming.   


He smacked me. Open hand. Over and over and over and over again. Blood flew down the hallway. Some of it as far as 4-5ft away from where my body sat upon impact. He shoved me into the bathroom and stuck our daughter on the cell phone to watch a show while I stood and bled in the shower and cried. I tried to step out in an effort to calm and comfort him because I was in pure survival mode at this point and I saw him pouring bleach down the entire hallway and cleaning up -- what was literally -- the crime scene. He bleached it like a murder scene out of a movie and I slunk back into the bathroom.  


I looked at myself in the mirror and I knew I had to do some kind of manipulation to get out of there. I put my daughter in bed, her pajamas covered in my blood. And I told her mommy was okay and we would be going home soon.  


I spent an hour convincing him that I was okay and he wasn't going back to prison and I instructed him on how to care for my wounds. I helped him get me an ice pack and inflammatory medications. And he helped dress my wounds. I convinced him to call a fellow felon and his old prison cell mate who we had just FaceTimed earlier that day. I told him if I was going to go home, this is someone he could trust and someone we could confide in to not go to the police as he was on parole as well (bank robbery, no victims). He would call his friend a few times and his friend kept trying to get through to him. My boyfriend would give me the window to start telling this guy the address and then he would hang up. He was taunting me. The friend would call again. My boyfriend finally gave me the space to say the whole address. He had to drive from 2 hours away. But he did it.  


At some point, while bloody and swollen, chunks of my hair easily brushed away from my head, he asked me ""So what's up, you wanna fuck?"" And I let him. It's so entirely fucked up but I let him right then and there. And then in the middle of it, there was a knock at the door. It was finally my saving grace, his friend. His friend tried, and I could see it, he tried to contain his horrific reaction. He stared at me and put his hand behind my back and guided me to get our daughter. He stood right behind me and in between my boyfriend and guided me to the car. We got my daughter strapped in. He helped me.  


He went back inside while I strapped in the carseat and was talking to my boyfriend. I came back in, why? I don't know. But I did. And I ran my hand through my bloody, matted hair. I got to the back of my head and a huge chunk of hair came out and onto my hand. And I handed it to my boyfriend. And said ""Here you go."" He asked me ""What? Do you want some more?"" And he laughed. He laughed at me in front of this person that was supposed to save me.  


And his friend said ""Go wait in the car."" At that moment, I was trusting my life in the hands of someone I had never met before. And the friend came and got in the car. And he drove me home. And on the way home, he told me that he had no idea of my husband's charges and that he had hidden all of his charges in prison and stated the assault he was convicted of was on a man. And then this friend told me how his father had killed his mother. And that's why he started robbing banks after being put in foster care. And he warned me. And warned me. And begged me not to return. He told me he didn't care how far the relationship went with his ex-celly, that my presence and my situation hit home for him far more and was far more important than someone he went to prison with. And I couldn't be more grateful for this man's existence. Honestly.  


Anyway so I went to the hospital after that. I had a burner phone (learned from the first time). I had called EMS and they did a transport. No broken bones, etc. Just some stitches this time, by the grace of God.  


And then on September 6th, 2019... I married him. Not the friend. But my boyfriend. I married my boyfriend that had just beaten the life out of me and I had to beg for freedom for two weeks later. I got married with two black eyes.   


And the abuse continued. Of course it continued. Why wouldn't it?  


From December 2019 to January 2020, in a 2 week period... 14 days. He had laid his hands on me and threatened to kill me 9 times.   


It was on a Sunday that he last hit me. I waited and tried to persevere all day. I was constantly having mental breakdowns at this point because of the abuse (and he would come in and be captain save this girl and skip work to help my mental state by over coddling me from the pain he had caused, really). He went to work that next Monday morning and I called into work. I told him I needed to take time and just be okay mentally and he agreed and he left for work. I packed all of his essentials into a laundry basket and set them by the door. Around 3PM that day, I told him that he would not be coming home that night and he had to stay elsewhere. He detested that idea. He insisted he at least come by to pick up essentials to stay with his mother and I told him no. I told him he was not welcome to come pick up his things and if he came, I would call the police. Because I knew at that moment, if he came home, he would either a) beat the life of out of me/kill me or b) lure me in all over again. Honestly, in hindsight, I think B would be attempted and when it wasn't applicable, A would happen.  


He then proceeded to threaten me. He told me that I was going to need my gun if I ever saw him again (I got a gun in 2017 actually to protect myself against him, again, yikes). He told me he was going to come and kill me. We had shared location settings on our iPhones (I cleaned houses all over the southern part of our state for a living and some people were sketchy, I was by myself a lot and it was a safety measure prompted by me. Although I'm sure he loved it too bc he could keep an eye on me) I could see he was on his way to me. So I called his cousin who had seen me battered and bruised in August -- coincidentally I had just been in a very bad car crash so I blamed my bruising on that when she happened upon me accidentally... But one night in the kitchen (he was paroled to her house) she told me, in front of him, that if he ever abused me, she didn't care if he was family or not, I could come to her. And she could be my safe space. So I called her that day. I told her ""Do you remember this talk we had in the kitchen? 2013 was because of me. The bruising wasn't from the car crash. And now he's on his way to kill me."" And she told me ""I'm on my way.""  


But the problem was -- she wasn't on her way. She contacted him to see where he was and he immediately drove back to work. She went to his work. WITH ALL GOOD INTENTIONS, MIND YOU. She wanted to intercept him. I get that. I understand that. And from her view -- she did. She succeeded in that and at no point in time can I fault her for this. But she never told me this. She told me she was coming to me and she lived 17 minutes away. 30 minutes passed and she never came and he was still erratically texting me and I called 911.  


The police came, and they told me they couldn't protect me and wait around all night. So they took me with them to the police station after I packed a bag. And they took a statement and in the middle of the statement is when I received a call from his cousin. She told me she was with him and that he was calm and would be staying at her house that night. And then she handed the phone to him. And my eyes bulged and I hung up. She texted me apologizing for not understanding but still.   


So unknowingly really, I made the statement against my now husband. And he's now sitting on a $175,000 bond for 2 counts of family violence, 1 count continuous family violence, a parole violation, and a violation of a protective order and honestly? I don't think he's ever coming home. I supplied the detective with multiple admissions of guilt (such as: Are you ever going to apologize for slamming my head into the ground? ::  I'm sorry).   


I don't know. I don't know why I've typed all of this. I am safe. And I know of trauma bonding now. And I know that I am severely trauma bonding and I am trying to break these holds as we speak.   


I just want to kind of put my story out there and tell you guys:  


Please. Take the resources of counseling. Take the family support. Take everything. Be as selfish and greedy as you can be in your HEALTHY recovery. Or you may end up being as selfish and greedy as I was in re-obtaining the love I once thought I had.   


Anyway thanks for letting me rant, idk.",domesticviolence

A light at the end of the tunnel... And the beginning of my life,"I was beat and raped by my ex. And I hated my life. I hated myself but it didn't really click as being a bad situation. I was with him since 11th grade in high school, I figured that's how it was. Sex just ended in pain or tears. And then my ex brought his friend home. And me and that friend bonded over his dog (I'm obsessed with dogs). For some reason the friend started staying the night on the couch downstairs. And I relished those days because I wouldn't be hurt. And slowly the abuse happened less and less because that friend stayed five plus nights a week on average. And then in a mall parking lot, I realized... I needed help, and I was getting it from that friend. He knew I would be safe while he was there. That my ex wouldn't hurt me when he was there.... 

It's going to be our third wedding anniversary in September. My husband saved me from my ex. Now we care for each other every day. Working with each other's trauma (his ex is almost as bad). We grow together. There was light at the end of my tunnel. I just didn't see it until the very end.",domesticviolence

Seeking advice on financial aspects of leaving an abusive husband,"Financially dependent on abuser, ways to leave

I’m posting this for a friend. 
My friend (47) has been abused by her husband (60) for the last 25 years. He’s a narcissist with anger issues who sees himself as a victim in his own life. He’s incredibly verbally, emotionally financially and sexually abusive. He isolated her when she was 23 and he was in his late 30s. He’s taken up the best years of her life and if she doesn’t leave she will either kill herself or the stress will kill her. She lives in MN but she is originally from Turkey. She’s a citizen. She had 4 children, most of whom are adults. The younger two are in high school or going to college. The husband threatens to not pay for their college if she leaves them and he tells tha children. Her youngest has anxiety and is always worried that her mother is going to leave her behind or that she won’t get to go to college. She has places to go but doesn’t feel like she can leave. She has no self esteem and no degree. She’s financially dependent on him and so are her children. If there was a way that she could safely leave and have some financial leverage from him she would.  The situation is much more complex than this obviously and her plan is to leave in two years when her youngest will be going to college but that’s too far away and she’s getting worse everyday. What would you suggest?",domesticviolence
My (44f) partner (44m) attacked me during a verbal argument -- he says it's because I was arguing and wouldn't shut up while he was stressed.,"I don't know what to do. We were arguing (we were both frustrated by something we were doing, but he was admittedly a lot more sleep deprived than me). I was very frustrated both with the task at hand and him. I felt that he wasn't being reasonable with regards to the situation (he was trying to complete something that just wasn't working out, and he was spending hours on it) plus he was expecting me to help him endlessly and I was getting very frustrated.

&amp;#x200B;

A verbal argument erupted and it just didn't go well. I don't even recall exactly what was being said, but he was shouting at me and I was telling him that the project was never going to work out (I was being realistic but not very supportive). I don't know what was said that made him snap, but he came over and grabbed my arm, hard. He's grabbed me before and we agreed he would never put his hands on me again, so I pushed him back off me. He then head-butted me in the forehead.

&amp;#x200B;

It really hurt and (3 days later) I still have headaches. He did apologize but told me it was also my fault for escalating the fight when he was stressed and sleep deprived. 

&amp;#x200B;

I *want* to let it go. I want to accept his apology and his promises that this will never happen again, and accept that I had a hand in it by being horrible when he was so tired and stressed out. But as I look at the bruise on my forehead, I'm not sure if I should. I can't see this clearly -- how serious is this?

tldr: I argued with my partner while he was in a vulnerable position (tired and stressed) and he head-butted me.",domesticviolence
MIL and domestic violence,"My mother In law is getting out of control and I am so conflicted. She keeps calling me childish and pretty much telling me I’m lying about her sons abuse, she stated “there’s always two sides to the story” but there truly only is one. I am getting so emotional just writing this. She believes that I instigate my husband and that’s why he used to hit me and beat the shit out of me. I WAS SLEEPING when he came home and started to brutally beat me. I am so in shock. She keeps telling me to figure it out cause someone needs to watch our kids so I can go back to work and drop the restraining order because she’s not going to be driving back and forth the kids. Mind you I haven’t even asked her at all. Am I in the wrong? How could I be in the wrong wanting to stay protected against my abuser? I just don’t get it. I’m so emotionally drained that I can’t even stand up for myself. My abuser is in jail and she talks to him everyday so I don’t even tell her anything because I know she’ll pass it along to him.

Should I file for a PPO? I’m lost at what to do,"I’m still living with my sorta ex-bf during this COVID time. For context on the sorta, we talked about a month ago about how once our lease is up that we’re going to go separate ways. We’ve been having issues for a while now, but we decided to be civil with each other and live together until the end of July or until one of us can find a new place. He said he would help me with moving and that maybe we could try to see where life takes us once we move into different locations. 
This morning my entire perspective on our situation changed. We have a cat that I adopted when we were together, however I adopted her under my name and she’s legally my cat because he wasn’t at the shelter when I adopted her. We already agreed that she is mine and is going to live with me after all this stuff was said and done. She usually meows early in the morning to play or for food. This morning he lost his shit. Picked her up and threw her onto the bed and then tried smothering her with a pillow. I screamed at him and told him if he did it again I was calling the police. He responded by saying I was being dramatic and to stop crying. (He often gaslights me during our conversations)
I was so freaked out that I ended up bringing her to work with me because he’s currently working from home remotely during this while I still have to go in. Luckily my bosses were super chill and understanding. I just didn’t want to leave her alone with him for the fear that he might hurt her. When I was leaving he was like “I’m not gonna fuckin kill her”  
While this is the first time he’s done something to her it isn’t the first time he’s been violent. There’s been many times where he would grab my wrists or my legs to the point of bruising. He’s also sexually assaulted me multiple times throughout our relationship. 
I’m planning on moving out ASAP and already have things set up, but I still have to wait a few weeks. I started packing as soon as I got back today so I can leave as soon as I can get into my new place. 
Should I file for a PPO against him? If so should I do it now or as soon as I move out? I’m just completely broken at lost at what I should do right now. I’m definitely calling the police if things escalate or if he does anything else to her. I just don’t know what other options I have right now.",domesticviolence

I don’t understand what’s going on,"I’m sorry, this turned into a longer post than I first intended!

So yesterday, I (f29) made dinner for my partner (m29). I worked the night shift and gotten a few hours of sleep through the day so I was pretty tired by dinner time. 
He got home, after going work and then hanging out with his brother. We had dinner and I got up to clear the plates. He said thank you multiple times and dinner was very nice.
I asked him cheekily if he’s so grateful maybe he could give me a hand clearing up? And he said he didn’t wanna get up so soon after eating and I was like okay sure I understand.
I took the plates into the kitchen and a few mins later he came into the kitchen too I didn’t see what he did though coz I had my back to him.
I honestly thought he was gonna help me tidy up a bit.. but then he sat back down and when I turned looked he was sitting there rolling up a smoke while I tidied up. 
I sat back down in the living and I felt a bit down coz I guess I was left to tidy up while he was rolling a smoke?!
Anyway I didn’t say anything and he asked what was wrong so I said it would’ve been nice if you helped tidy up a bit while you were up anyway and he got super defensive so I just said okay cool and just left it alone and watched tv
And then he asked why I was so closed off and I’m like what dyu mean, and he just started ranting at me? 
He got seriously angry and started calling me a motherfucker, a cunt, he got up and went to the bedroom and slammed the door. He shouting at in the bedroom just abuse
He said I had an ego because I couldn’t clear the plates after him and I was a little person who was always unhappy 
After a while.. I called him and said look can we talk about this i dont know why you’re so angry and he told me to fuck off and said he’s not gonna talk to me 
And then later.. I was in bed and he came in talking about how I’m never happy, I always make him feel bad and take his self esteem away. He said he dreads coming home to me and doesn’t wanna be with me anymore etc etc so I let him and speak and then when I tried to reply, he told me to Fuck off and shut the door on me

Can someone explain what the hell just happened? I have no idea what I did to deserve that.. I didn’t even raise my voice or swear back

He slept in the living room.. and when he woke up he was slamming doors while I was still sleeping, he left the living in such a state aswell.. empty coke bottles and glasses, his clothes dumped, the coffee table covered in crumbs and tobacco bits 

I called him and asked him he’s being so nasty, while he didn’t even clean up a bit ? And he just got super defensive again saying things that didn’t been make sense and then hung up on me..

I'm afraid for my boyfriend's safety [URGENT],"I am losing my mind. We live in different city, we are both quarantining with our families and we are university students in a third city. I know that his father has been been physically violent with him all his life but he doesn't go home often because of that but now because of the virus he had to.

We were arguing literally all night on the phone about unimportant stuff and stress, suddenly around 7 a.m. he hangs up. He calls me again after like 10 minutes and says that his father burst in his room so he had to hang up. Okay, we continue talking we finally start to reach to an agreement about our fight when around 8 a.m. he hangs up again. This time he calls me around 30-40 minutes later, he is crying. I ask him what's wrong he tells me that his parents were fighting the first time his father came in the room he took his phone and throw it on the ground and left the room. Then my boyfriend called me again, and the second time he hang up, his father came into his room again and hit him with some object on his mouth and broke one of his lower teeth.

So my boyfriend is crying I ask him to please go to a dentist it might be serious, he tells me he won't he just needs to stop the bleeding. He says his father left and that he feels better now he just needs to stop the bleeding. He says he'll leave tomorrow back to the city where we study at, he just needs to find a place to live very quickly, and he tells me he'll report his father to the police. I get scared and tell him that maybe he should do that after he leaves so that his father won't be able to do anything to him, because in our country the police doesn't do shit about domestic violence cases.

He says he doesn't care anymore even if his father beats him up completely but he has to call the police, and that he'll do it later. We talk some more, I try to keep his mind off of it maybe I made a mistake there. He then tells me around 9:30 a.m. that he'll start studying I ask him if he's okay he says yes we'll talk later, and we hang up. I know I'm awful I didn't do anything.

Then I massage him around 10 a.m. asking him how he's feeling if his tooth hurts and if he stopped the bleeding, he doesn't reply but it says that he's online and the messages I send are being delivered. I call him he doesn't answer, I call him a lot of times he doesn't answer, I text him, I message him on facebook he doesn't answer. Around 40 minutes later he goes offline, and his phone is turned off. Now it's been 3 hours, I keep calling him every 10 minutes it's still off. I don't know what to do I have no one to tell please help me I don't know what to do.",domesticviolence
I’m not crying anymore. Is something wrong with me?,"I had been with my ex partner for 5 years. 3 years ago I bought a house for us with the intention of us being together and eventually marrying  and having kids....if we could get our relationship on track. 

The 5 years has been full of lots of ups and downs. It started as mental and verbal abuse then turned into physical abuse once we moved into the house. I used to tell him he was the meanest person I’ve ever met and I’ve never cried so much in my life until I got with him. 

Over the years I stopped telling him about things going on with my family and friends because when I did he would twist things and use them against me. Example once he told me I was having an emotional affair with a male friend I worked with since I talked to him everyday. This everyday wasn’t recent and I saw him everyday AT WORK! That’s all he needed to accuse me. 

He was also very neglectful to me. I used to beg for him to call me and spend time with me. He would flip it around and accuse me of being neglectful when truthfully I contacted him more. Eventually I started doing that less and just hung with my friends or myself. I just started lowering my expectations so I would get less disappointed by him. He still found ways to disappoint me. 

He never hit me but he broke my things, held me up against the wall, used intimidation and threats against me (I could go on). I had my last straw 2 weeks ago when he broke 3 things of mine in a span of 3 days and made threats. So I left. I’m still in the process of getting him out of my home. I have a protection order against him. 

I was really sad and crying daily up until 2 days ago. I don’t feel sadness. Is something wrong with me? I wanted to marry this person and have a family with him at one point and time. We even were engaged (I ended it last year but we stayed together). I know grieving is supposed to take a while...surely longer than a week and a half. I feel like during the relationship I learned how to forgive him and get past things quickly in order to proceed with the relationship. How do I stop doing that so I can properly heal and grieve? 

We have “broken up” ( I break up with him he doesn’t accept it so we stay together) with him many times over the years. It doesn’t really feel real sometimes and it’s hard to believe all of this has happened to me.",domesticviolence
"I (F19) am living with my bf (M21) and his family during quarantine, but hes not the abusive one.","So some back story:
 
I had an abusive father for the first 15 years of my life. In his earlier days, my father would drink and smoke weed with his cousins, pop pills, dabbled in coke a little. But when he met my mom, he stopped doing everything else bc she told him what was good. After being together for about a year and a half, I come along. I didnt notice my father was abusive until I had to witnessed his drunken rage myself. I was diagnosed with PTSD, Major Depressive Disorder, and Severe Anxiety because of the shit I endured at my fathers residence. Im not going into this topic any further. 

So, my bf and I have been together for 6 months and its been wonderful. Hes the most thoughtful and caring person Ive met, hes always the first one to lend a hand and reach out to people when they need. Before our relationship, he was with this girl for 3 years and she was extremely abusive to him. She had Epilepsy and when they were together, my bf took care of her. She would fake seizures just to laugh in his face when he reacted and she hit him while he was driving. After they broke up he told his parents and friends about what was going on. 

Now his father doesn't like this Ex, understandable. But my bfs Mother has no problems with her.

Now the best way I can describe my bfs mom is she always thinks shes right and does nothing wrong, she can make fun of and tease everyone but cant take it back, she must be waited on hand and foot whether shes demanding coffee, more food, or for my bf or his dad to drop what they're doing to assist her. My bfs parents own a business and she controls all of the finances. Everything is in her name. She constantly holds each weeks paycheck over my bfs head and then BARELY pays her own husband what hes owed at the end of the week ( which would be abt $550 every week, but he gets $100 allowance instead). She's verbally abusive to my bf calling him the most degrading names, i dont understand how someone could could tell their son that he's worthless and doesn't deserve shit bc hes standing up for himself when all he's doing is his job. 

One of the most recent things that happened was as my bf was doing his task, his mom interviens and ends up fucking up some business orders. Somehow everyone starts yelling at my bf for being ""too sensitive"" and ""not taking a joke"" when he was actually being insulted. I stood up for him and said he was just doing his job and trying to help and i was met with ""you stay out of this, none of your business, you don't need to defend our son."" 

BUT IF I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO'S GOING TO DO IT YOU BET YOUR ASS IM GOING TO DEFEND HIM. 

Because of corona, we have to stay with this vindictive bitch and its bringing back a lot of past trauma. we cant work rn bc she doesn't want us to be exposed to too many ppl.


My point in making this post was to put out there that if you're in a similar situation, you aren't alone. i'm slowly losing myself but i'm hanging on in hope we can get to our safe haven.",domesticviolence
My boyfriends sister hit me during lockdown,"
So when lockdown was announced me (f22) and my boyfriend (m24) decided that I would spend it at his house where he lives with his mum and sister. His mum was fine with this as we get on well, his sisters boyfriend would also be staying and spending his days in the house as he and I both can’t work. My boyfriend and his sister are both essential workers. 

My boyfriends sister has never liked me and has previously informed my boyfriend ‘I’m not bothering with her because I tried with all the rest and they all go in the end’. So after that comment I’ve tried not to get in her way or join in too much in her conversation. 

About 2/3 weeks into lockdown it all kicked off, we were all in the kitchen at the time and my boyfriend was making general conversation that they were either ignoring or giving short answers too, he ended up asking his sister why we’d been blocked on all social media and what the problem was. Firstly they started saying to leave it alone and that she’s done with him, then she was shouting calling me a bitch and a cow, saying that I’m a creep because she can’t hear me coming down the stairs. 

As this was happening I was stood across the opposite side to them in the kitchen, stunned for words, his sister is 6ft so when she kicks off everyone’s frightened. Then she started to say I couldn’t speak for myself and I was stood there ‘like butter wouldn’t melt’ so I simply said to her ‘at least I’m not a (bad word)’like you. 

They both then barged past me through the door, she elbowed my arm then made a fist and punched the side of my face, I think if she’d hit my eye I definitely would’ve had a black eye. I was left holding my face in shock as they went upstairs and my boyfriend followed them up to defend me. 

Since then we were able to go to a family members house that was empty to quarantine together alone. The empty house now needs to be sold so we’re back living above his sister. The day before we came back she sent this text;

“Mum mentioned you and (my name) are coming back home, I’m sorry for what happened. Can we at least try and be civil whilst we are in lockdown together? Me and (her boyfriend) have been civil with mum, I hope we can do the same- without arguments. I hope you and (my name) are doing ok? And work has not been too stressful for you? Stay safe and see you soon. “

Tbh I just found this to be a further slap in the face, a half assed apology for ‘what happened’ not that she hit me? Not that she makes everyone so frightened we had to leave? My boyfriend ended up not replying as he didn’t want to rock the boat before we got back. It’s been six days now and we haven’t even crossed paths, I’m not looking forward to it. His sister is famous for not apologising and completely believes in herself, as well as her boyfriend who just goes along so he’s not in her war path. 

I’m not sure I can ever forgive her, and Id like to know what others would’ve done in mine and my boyfriends position? 

TL;DR! My boyfriends sister hit me, and we’ve come back after a month of living in a separate house to her pretending like it never happened with no real apology. I’m not sure I can ever forgive her.

EDIT: sorry had to remove a suggestion of a bad word!!!",domesticviolence

Witnessing domestic abuse as a young teen [TRIGGER WARNING],"Hello everyone,

I am not sure if this is the place I could post about my situation, because I have not really been the one that's gone through the physical abuse part, but I was a witness of it for a few years back when I was younger. I'm 20 now. When I was about 14, my dad started physically and emotionally abusing my mother, the emotional abuse had actually started way before that, but that's when it escalated to something else. 

I remember a lot of things very vividly. A lot of things I've heard that I should not have, I've seen a lot of things I shouldn't have. The abuse had started because my dad was a very jealous and possessive guy (what a surprise) and always had suspicions that my mom was cheating on him. So one day he brutally beats her up, parts of her hair were missing, she had a lot of bruises and was almost unrecognisable, avoiding to look at me. Many adults knew about the abuse from day 1 and no one offered a hand. I'm not saying I'm the victim here, obviously it's my mom that had it the worst. But it just breaks my heart and leaves me very conflicted about everything in my life. 

My father had been locking my mom, beating her, blackmailing her, throwing things at her, taking all her documents (because he was afraid she would run away or leave the country), he had made her write in a notebook about all her sexual encounters and then made her read it to us, while he would hit her after every sentence that he gets annoyed by. He threatened to cut her in parts and send her to her mom if she tries to run away or do anything without his permission. He drove all of us in a car while being completely drunk and hitting her while driving. 

I am COMPLETELY devastated and I really have no clue about what to do with myself. Not sure if therapy works, it always ends up being about me forgiving my father. And I am really not capable of that. I can't forgive a monster that ruined all of my family members' lives. I can't live with this.

I can't even fully have him out of my life, because they are still together (the physical abuse is not happening anymore), but I can't pretend to not remember anything and it's sort of made me get distanced from my mother as well. And I have so many things to tell her. That I've always been on her side, that I'll always protect her as much as I can and I want to say sorry for everything she's gone through. I'm also sorry if she sees him in me and that creates a bigger distance between us. But I understand it. 

I am so sorry, mom.",domesticviolence
Feeling forced to press charges &amp; potentially pregnant by my abuser,"Me[25F] and my ex[31M] had been together for about 9/10 years. I left him about 2 weeks ago. It’s been draining for me and right now I don’t see the light at the end of the tunnel. I feel sick without him, like my chest caves in every time I think about the fact that we’re over. I’m in a really tough situation right now because I think that I may be pregnant. While I was with him he would sometimes either beat me until I almost blacked out or waited until I was sleep to have unprotected sex with me. A year ago when I secretly got on birth control that didn’t go well and he made me stop taking it. I ended up getting pregnant and I miscarried at 10 weeks. I didn’t know I was pregnant until I miscarries. Ever since then he would have unprotected sex with me while I was sleep or almost unconscious. It’s really weird and traumatizing having to wake up to that. 

I have not taken a pregnancy test but I am sure I’m most likely pregnant. I have already had an abortion when I was 16 on top of the miscarriage last year. I am a red to get another abortion. I feel like karma or something will happen in the future when I do want kids By the right person. I still love him but I know it’s dumb to have a kid by him right now. I feel like another abortion is gonna cause issues. 

I am currently at my moms house and I told her about me potentially being pregnant and she was upset and disappointed. She’s been basically ignoring me since I’ve been here and I am scared of how she’ll react if I tell her that I want an abortion. I feel like I sound like a little girl but I really would like the support of my mother during this time. She’s very judgemental when it comes to things like this. Plus I disobeyed her trying to and ran away with him when I turned 18 after dealing with him as a teen. She told me not to repeatedly but I didn’t listen. 

I feel like I put myself in a stupid situation. My mom says that if I don’t press charges on him while I still have “proof” (bruises, scars, etc.) then I will have to leave. I understand but I am just not ready to do that. I don’t want to press charges just yet. I’m not planning on going back to him but I’m not in the right headspace  to do all of this.

I just feel like this heartbreak won’t ever end. He’s called me numerous times and his last text said that he’ll give me my space but we’re goin got talk. I haven’t responded to him. I’m thinking about showing my mom that I haven’t spoken to him and that I’ll block his number. Just to give her some faith that I won’t go back and hopefully she’ll get off my back about making a report.

I guess I just needed to vent because I don’t have a specific question but I would appreciate any advice.",domesticviolence
Living with a schizophrenic as a child,,domesticviolence
Preparing for moving forward,"I’m trying to put some ducks in a row and trying to figure out what all I should do. My husband has been verbally abusive for years. I have little pieces of evidence, but not much. For my own mental health and for the safety of my kids, I need full custody. 

Do I absolutely have to get a lawyer? Do I need to file some form of police report first? Is the emotional abuse enough?",domesticviolence
A co-worker and victim,"I work with a woman who dated my abusive ex's brother. I'm still working with her, after dumping my ex, I see that she's an amazing worker, kind and polite, but deep down I'm so scared of her. She was with my ex's brother for a few months, she hung out around our shared apartment and at that time she was very unkind and impolite. But when I think about that time, the things I saw as unkind were blown out of proportion by my ex and his brother. Like we were being pitted against one another. They wanted me to hate her. I feel so much anxiety talking to her, so much doubt about what she's saying about the abuse she faced. I don't know how to deal with it. I never want to doubt her, or victim shame her, yet i feel conditioned to do so. I want to share our experience and bond over it but at the same time I'm very scared of it and find myself projecting onto her, and suffering from the way my ex treated her and his brother did. She tries to talk to me, she's kind and curious. Asking thoughtful questions, and it scares me, and I'm sick of it. This is mostly a rant, but if anyone can just say kind words or help me I'd really appreciate it. Thanks.",domesticviolence
Still not sleeping?,"As I lay awake at a miserable 2:30 am, reflecting on every event with such impeccable detail as I do every night, I wonder when it is I wont have this torrent of information forced at me like a miserable waterfall intent on drowning me in the evening. I don’t want to remember every detail, yet going to court has almost hammered this habit in to me where I must describe it all despite the amount of pain I was in.

I feel as though court itself can cause even more trauma. Having to be choked out by whatever spineless lawyer takes their case, defends them, and actively tries to attack you. This new behavior of recalling everything, dates, times, action and reactions has a play by play running through my head every evening until I cry and eventually fall asleep. Recollection I understand, but to have so much apprehension of events that haven’t happened yet? Even worse. “What if I have to court for xyz, what points do I make? I need to make a list of everything so I don’t miss anything like I did before.”

But the thing is... I’m not there anymore. I had gotten rid of my abuser in October. So why is it I can’t shake it now? Why do I dread going to sleep every night if the real nightmare is over? I have tried sleep medication after sleep medication. I have tried some mild anxiety medication. I have to know when I can sleep normally.

I haven’t slept well for years with them, but being able to sleep in my own bed without being forced to sleep on the couch was something I had looked forward to. How long does it take to feel safe again, to really feel peaceful, if any of you have that experience?

On another note, I know quarantine has been shifting behavior, but I have been scared to leave my house. Not feeling outright fear but my heart races and I’m worried the confidence I had built is slowly diminishing, it was something I had a problem with when I first left my situation because I thought I would run in to him and whatever “consequences” I would get for getting him in trouble. Has anyone been struggling with this as well?",domesticviolence
"Do you think some people, men, would not develop their aggression and turn into violent monsters if they've had met the right person?","My partner never loved me. I developed codependency and he defends himself as being to weak to break with me. We have hardly speak in very beginning of our relationship. He would take newspapers immediately when we would sit at coffee table. He never wanted to learn more about me. Everything I would say was  annoying to him. Decade forward and we truly hate each other. Our relationship is dead, he is abusive, we can't separate due to financial reasons, for this very moment, but probably will soon. 

He met another woman with whom he's total opposite of what he was with me. Charming, talks with her eight hours a day. Likes her jokes, personality, appearance. I wonder, how would he respond if they met sooner and if he lived with her instead of me. Would she react differently to his temper tantrums? Would she calm him down in a way I can't? Would he take effort in not hurting her due to strong feelings of attachment, love and respect? How is this going? Do wrong people who stay together make each other worse and turn one another into violent assholes? Do right people uplift you and make you better and change your personality into something that's socially acceptable?

What can you say from your experience? Was your relationship steady and healthy, with respect and love in beginning? Did it have solid grounds? Do you know people who were violent in one relationship and normal in the another one?",domesticviolence
I decided to keep count of everything my BF does,"Friday, May 15 2020: 
My boyfriend and i got into an argument over getting a new car, when I told him I believed he had already made up his mind, he told me “no seas pendeja.” He then grabbed the pen I was using, looked at me and started stabbing the notebook several times while screaming. 
He apologized hours later, after I confronted him. 

May 21, 2020 
My boyfriend started freaking out when the new car’s check engine light was on. He threw his phone after I told him to calm down. I then told him afterwards that I was just trying to lighten the mood, he then said “you could’ve done that earlier” the rest of the trip was silent

Protective order violation?,"It’s been two and a half months since his misdemeanor assault charges. He was left off on a lower sentence with probation because this was a first guilty assault offense. I already have a protective order in place. Now he has violated it and the magistrate has formally charged him with a violation. This also violates his probation for his assault charge where he should be facing jail time.

1. Probation violation
2. Protective order violation

How likely is it he will face jail time? Court is next month (assuming he doesn’t push it back a couple months of course). I can’t bring myself to go but since the magistrate is charging and there are already three witness statements (me, someone with me, and the owner of the location who asked him to leave and he refused) I don’t think I will need to go and it isn’t worth the added trauma.

Angry and Confused with my Sister,[deleted],domesticviolence
Escape plan into Europe review .,[removed],domesticviolence
Not entirely sure what to do,"I'm in a relationship that began a couple months ago. She's generally sweet and our relationship is fairly good. She has had some unfortunate relationships in the past, including one that was emotionally abusive and the guy even hit her in the face in front of her family.. Having said that, there have been a couple instances that make me anxious and I'm unsure of how to proceed. 

Instance 1 - We had a group of friends come over and she get incredibly drunk and blacked out part of the night. She was incredibly emotional and at multiple times told her best friend she doesn't think I care about her while I was standing 6 feet away each time. I had even invited her best friend over because of how sad she (my gf) was feeling that her friend wasn't there. There were some other inappropriate things that night and I told her that I wasn't comfortable with that. The next morning I told her that I wanted her to go back to therapy.

Instance 2 - After a night of drinking, we facetimed her best friend as we were closed to going to bed. During the conversation I made an off-hand reference to my gf's ex about how I didn't remember his name because I had been drunk when I met him. My girlfriend's face turned incredibly angry and she tried to choke me with one hand, and when I took her hand off my neck she tried with the next hand. This was while her friend was on the phone. She hung up shortly after. I told my girlfriend that if she ever did that again that we were done. She said it happened because her ex's name triggered a bunch of her past memories, but that she wasn't trying to make that an excuse for what happened.  She still slept over that night because I couldn't bring myself to tell her to leave...

Instance 3 - We went to a friend's house and the night was going great. At a certain point were were sort of alone and she had her hand around my neck, which in a normal world I don't see that as a bad thing (just like a normal hands on the head / neck which would be comforting in some situations). But she went ahead and applied a little bit of pressure all the while having a really jokey face. I told her to not do that ever and she said she was sorry and I don't really remember the rest of the conversation because I was upset and drunk. She did say she wouldn't do it again.

I'm a guy and I feel incredibly weird about this. When I told my best friend this he said he was scared for me. I don't really feel 'scared' physically, but I do feel anxious just because I don't know how much of her reaction of going to therapy or saying that she won't do that again is truly real. It complicates things more when we both share the same friends from before we were together.  I've talked to my therapist about this but it doesn't feel like it's helping. I apologize if this is sort of scattered. 

tl;dr my girlfriend choked me briefly because i made an off-hand comment about an ex. she has apologized and is going to therapy but I feel incredibly weird about this.",domesticviolence

Question about domestic violence,"I got in a fight with my husband the other day. We have been together for 27 years. There has been some historical violence in our past and usually occurs just a few times a year. I’m not sure if it’s my fault. There a three sides to every story so I’ll try my best to make sure I state everything. Usually an argument starts about something stupid like why I opened the curtains when he just closed them even tho I didn’t know that. I told him that I just wanted some sunshine and I opened the curtains. He told me that I was being defiant and not obeying him like I said I would during our marriage vows. I apologized and said that I didn’t know he had just closed the curtains. That went on for about 10 minutes. I walked away and went to bed to cool off as I couldn’t handle the conversation of me being disobedient cuz I really didn’t think that I was and I was really going to lay into him about the whole “I shall obey my husband” speech. I k we better than to get started on that conversation. He came up to see me about 10 minutes later and laid on the bed with me. He started to talk calmly about it with me and then started with how disobedient I am and how defiant I am towards him all the time. He starting laying I. To me about it and was really pushing my buttons to the point I was seeing red and was going to punch him. I started to feel threatened and really angry so I kicked his leg to push him out of my way. It was not hard but I still kicked him. He then grabbed me by my hair, lifted me off there best and threw me face down in to the bed. He had my arm behind my back and was pulling my hair so hard that my neck was bending towards my back.  I could feel the muscles pulling in my back. I told him he was being an asshole and I didn’t care that he thought I was disobedient or defiant and that he could f himself. I couldn’t move or do anything to physically get out of the situation. He made me repeat what I said and if I didn’t he would pull harder on my arm and my hair. So I said it. He then flipped me over on to my back and was sitting on top of me. He had his hands around my throat and his knees on my arms. He had my legs pinned under his somehow. I couldn’t move. He looked at me and told me he was going to rape me and that I would probably like it. I started crying and he got off of me and let me go. I started to walk away and then he starts telling me again what a disobedient bitch I am and that I broke my promise to God. I got in his face and told him he was a dick and he can go f himself. He started yelling at me some more so I slapped him. He then started choking me and threw me on the floor. Eventually I just lay there and let him continue as in the past it always made him ease up. He did and let me go. I left the room and went to another room. He came to see me and started talking with me. Asking me why I keep letting this happen to us. I don’t know why I do. I don’t know I started the argument. I shouldn’t have kicked him. I should have used my words like a normal person. I have a temper and I know I do and being enraged when I can’t get my words out is a very volatile situation for me. I tried my best to calm the situation but it seemed that he was trying to get me mad on purpose. He would ask me questions and I give him my honest answer and it never matters what I say, it’s wrong and I am being defiant. I guess I’m just frustrated with never being able to give a right answer to him to make him happy. Is this all my fault? Did I start it because I disagree with some of things he says and then kicked him when he pushed my buttons? I’m so confused. I know I started the violence, I just need to learn to control it.",domesticviolence

He had beat me relentlessly and I went to the police before and they got a warrant for his arrest for Domestic battery and Strangulation.

I felt terrible. My partner called me names at first and then said he was sorry and didn't blame me and he needed help. The police were looking for him but he went into hiding. I went back to him the very next day and he slammed my head against the car window and called me names and said everything is my fault for the way his life is. He also beat an ex girlfriend and she got a protective order against him. Then the coronavirus happened and he got a new job and he still repeatedly beat me.

I have an extensive amount of proof against him and I'm tired of living in fear and no legal place is picking up my phone call and I need some help.

TEMPORARY HOUSING OPTION!!,"Hello to all of you wonderful strong people. After a lot of thought I’ve decided to offer my Los Angeles apartment as temporary housing for someone in a difficult situation at a reduced rate. 

I’m currently quarantining with my family, back and forth between the Bay Area and San Diego. My apartment is likely going to be empty until WFH is over. 

A bit about the apartment - it’s located in Koreatown and is about 680 square feet. No roommates. Full bathroom with bathtub, kitchen, washing machine, dryer, dishwasher, TV, WiFi, balcony. I also have some food in the freezer which I can leave for you to use. Just take care of my plants &lt;3 

If you’re interested please send me a PM. I’m a lawyer and I can write us up a contract. I really want to use this empty space to help someone who needs it.

EDIT with more info: there’s also an assigned parking space, pets are allowed with a deposit (the apartment complex imposes the deposit not me), and it’s close to a lot of grocery stores! I’ll be leaving all of my cookware, furniture, and cleaning supplies for you to use. 

I’d really love to help someone out so rent &amp; time period would be negotiable~ 
I’ll be away for at least the summer.

Also, I am a woman who used to be in an emotionally abusive relationship, so I am understanding! I want to help someone.

Should I file for a PPO? I’m lost at what to do,"I’m still living with my sorta ex-bf during this COVID time. For context on the sorta, we talked about a month ago about how once our lease is up that we’re going to go separate ways. We’ve been having issues for a while now, but we decided to be civil with each other and live together until the end of July or until one of us can find a new place. He said he would help me with moving and that maybe we could try to see where life takes us once we move into different locations. 
This morning my entire perspective on our situation changed. We have a cat that I adopted when we were together, however I adopted her under my name and she’s legally my cat because he wasn’t at the shelter when I adopted her. We already agreed that she is mine and is going to live with me after all this stuff was said and done. She usually meows early in the morning to play or for food. This morning he lost his shit. Picked her up and threw her onto the bed and then tried smothering her with a pillow. I screamed at him and told him if he did it again I was calling the police. He responded by saying I was being dramatic and to stop crying. (He often gaslights me during our conversations)
I was so freaked out that I ended up bringing her to work with me because he’s currently working from home remotely during this while I still have to go in. Luckily my bosses were super chill and understanding. I just didn’t want to leave her alone with him for the fear that he might hurt her. When I was leaving he was like “I’m not gonna fuckin kill her”  
While this is the first time he’s done something to her it isn’t the first time he’s been violent. There’s been many times where he would grab my wrists or my legs to the point of bruising. He’s also sexually assaulted me multiple times throughout our relationship. 
I’m planning on moving out ASAP and already have things set up, but I still have to wait a few weeks. I started packing as soon as I got back today so I can leave as soon as I can get into my new place. 
Should I file for a PPO against him? If so should I do it now or as soon as I move out? I’m just completely broken at lost at what I should do right now. I’m definitely calling the police if things escalate or if he does anything else to her. I just don’t know what other options I have right now.",domesticviolence

I don’t understand what’s going on,"I’m sorry, this turned into a longer post than I first intended!

So yesterday, I (f29) made dinner for my partner (m29). I worked the night shift and gotten a few hours of sleep through the day so I was pretty tired by dinner time. 
He got home, after going work and then hanging out with his brother. We had dinner and I got up to clear the plates. He said thank you multiple times and dinner was very nice.
I asked him cheekily if he’s so grateful maybe he could give me a hand clearing up? And he said he didn’t wanna get up so soon after eating and I was like okay sure I understand.
I took the plates into the kitchen and a few mins later he came into the kitchen too I didn’t see what he did though coz I had my back to him.
I honestly thought he was gonna help me tidy up a bit.. but then he sat back down and when I turned looked he was sitting there rolling up a smoke while I tidied up. 
I sat back down in the living and I felt a bit down coz I guess I was left to tidy up while he was rolling a smoke?!
Anyway I didn’t say anything and he asked what was wrong so I said it would’ve been nice if you helped tidy up a bit while you were up anyway and he got super defensive so I just said okay cool and just left it alone and watched tv
And then he asked why I was so closed off and I’m like what dyu mean, and he just started ranting at me? 
He got seriously angry and started calling me a motherfucker, a cunt, he got up and went to the bedroom and slammed the door. He shouting at in the bedroom just abuse
He said I had an ego because I couldn’t clear the plates after him and I was a little person who was always unhappy 
After a while.. I called him and said look can we talk about this i dont know why you’re so angry and he told me to fuck off and said he’s not gonna talk to me 
And then later.. I was in bed and he came in talking about how I’m never happy, I always make him feel bad and take his self esteem away. He said he dreads coming home to me and doesn’t wanna be with me anymore etc etc so I let him and speak and then when I tried to reply, he told me to Fuck off and shut the door on me

Can someone explain what the hell just happened? I have no idea what I did to deserve that.. I didn’t even raise my voice or swear back

He slept in the living room.. and when he woke up he was slamming doors while I was still sleeping, he left the living in such a state aswell.. empty coke bottles and glasses, his clothes dumped, the coffee table covered in crumbs and tobacco bits 

I called him and asked him he’s being so nasty, while he didn’t even clean up a bit ? And he just got super defensive again saying things that didn’t been make sense and then hung up on me..

I'm afraid for my boyfriend's safety [URGENT],"I am losing my mind. We live in different city, we are both quarantining with our families and we are university students in a third city. I know that his father has been been physically violent with him all his life but he doesn't go home often because of that but now because of the virus he had to.

We were arguing literally all night on the phone about unimportant stuff and stress, suddenly around 7 a.m. he hangs up. He calls me again after like 10 minutes and says that his father burst in his room so he had to hang up. Okay, we continue talking we finally start to reach to an agreement about our fight when around 8 a.m. he hangs up again. This time he calls me around 30-40 minutes later, he is crying. I ask him what's wrong he tells me that his parents were fighting the first time his father came in the room he took his phone and throw it on the ground and left the room. Then my boyfriend called me again, and the second time he hang up, his father came into his room again and hit him with some object on his mouth and broke one of his lower teeth.

So my boyfriend is crying I ask him to please go to a dentist it might be serious, he tells me he won't he just needs to stop the bleeding. He says his father left and that he feels better now he just needs to stop the bleeding. He says he'll leave tomorrow back to the city where we study at, he just needs to find a place to live very quickly, and he tells me he'll report his father to the police. I get scared and tell him that maybe he should do that after he leaves so that his father won't be able to do anything to him, because in our country the police doesn't do shit about domestic violence cases.

He says he doesn't care anymore even if his father beats him up completely but he has to call the police, and that he'll do it later. We talk some more, I try to keep his mind off of it maybe I made a mistake there. He then tells me around 9:30 a.m. that he'll start studying I ask him if he's okay he says yes we'll talk later, and we hang up. I know I'm awful I didn't do anything.

Then I massage him around 10 a.m. asking him how he's feeling if his tooth hurts and if he stopped the bleeding, he doesn't reply but it says that he's online and the messages I send are being delivered. I call him he doesn't answer, I call him a lot of times he doesn't answer, I text him, I message him on facebook he doesn't answer. Around 40 minutes later he goes offline, and his phone is turned off. Now it's been 3 hours, I keep calling him every 10 minutes it's still off. I don't know what to do I have no one to tell please help me I don't know what to do.",domesticviolence
I’m not crying anymore. Is something wrong with me?,"I had been with my ex partner for 5 years. 3 years ago I bought a house for us with the intention of us being together and eventually marrying  and having kids....if we could get our relationship on track. 

The 5 years has been full of lots of ups and downs. It started as mental and verbal abuse then turned into physical abuse once we moved into the house. I used to tell him he was the meanest person I’ve ever met and I’ve never cried so much in my life until I got with him. 

Over the years I stopped telling him about things going on with my family and friends because when I did he would twist things and use them against me. Example once he told me I was having an emotional affair with a male friend I worked with since I talked to him everyday. This everyday wasn’t recent and I saw him everyday AT WORK! That’s all he needed to accuse me. 

He was also very neglectful to me. I used to beg for him to call me and spend time with me. He would flip it around and accuse me of being neglectful when truthfully I contacted him more. Eventually I started doing that less and just hung with my friends or myself. I just started lowering my expectations so I would get less disappointed by him. He still found ways to disappoint me. 

He never hit me but he broke my things, held me up against the wall, used intimidation and threats against me (I could go on). I had my last straw 2 weeks ago when he broke 3 things of mine in a span of 3 days and made threats. So I left. I’m still in the process of getting him out of my home. I have a protection order against him. 

I was really sad and crying daily up until 2 days ago. I don’t feel sadness. Is something wrong with me? I wanted to marry this person and have a family with him at one point and time. We even were engaged (I ended it last year but we stayed together). I know grieving is supposed to take a while...surely longer than a week and a half. I feel like during the relationship I learned how to forgive him and get past things quickly in order to proceed with the relationship. How do I stop doing that so I can properly heal and grieve? 

We have “broken up” ( I break up with him he doesn’t accept it so we stay together) with him many times over the years. It doesn’t really feel real sometimes and it’s hard to believe all of this has happened to me.",domesticviolence
"I (F19) am living with my bf (M21) and his family during quarantine, but hes not the abusive one.","So some back story:
 
I had an abusive father for the first 15 years of my life. In his earlier days, my father would drink and smoke weed with his cousins, pop pills, dabbled in coke a little. But when he met my mom, he stopped doing everything else bc she told him what was good. After being together for about a year and a half, I come along. I didnt notice my father was abusive until I had to witnessed his drunken rage myself. I was diagnosed with PTSD, Major Depressive Disorder, and Severe Anxiety because of the shit I endured at my fathers residence. Im not going into this topic any further. 

So, my bf and I have been together for 6 months and its been wonderful. Hes the most thoughtful and caring person Ive met, hes always the first one to lend a hand and reach out to people when they need. Before our relationship, he was with this girl for 3 years and she was extremely abusive to him. She had Epilepsy and when they were together, my bf took care of her. She would fake seizures just to laugh in his face when he reacted and she hit him while he was driving. After they broke up he told his parents and friends about what was going on. 

Now his father doesn't like this Ex, understandable. But my bfs Mother has no problems with her.

Now the best way I can describe my bfs mom is she always thinks shes right and does nothing wrong, she can make fun of and tease everyone but cant take it back, she must be waited on hand and foot whether shes demanding coffee, more food, or for my bf or his dad to drop what they're doing to assist her. My bfs parents own a business and she controls all of the finances. Everything is in her name. She constantly holds each weeks paycheck over my bfs head and then BARELY pays her own husband what hes owed at the end of the week ( which would be abt $550 every week, but he gets $100 allowance instead). She's verbally abusive to my bf calling him the most degrading names, i dont understand how someone could could tell their son that he's worthless and doesn't deserve shit bc hes standing up for himself when all he's doing is his job. 

One of the most recent things that happened was as my bf was doing his task, his mom interviens and ends up fucking up some business orders. Somehow everyone starts yelling at my bf for being ""too sensitive"" and ""not taking a joke"" when he was actually being insulted. I stood up for him and said he was just doing his job and trying to help and i was met with ""you stay out of this, none of your business, you don't need to defend our son."" 

BUT IF I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO'S GOING TO DO IT YOU BET YOUR ASS IM GOING TO DEFEND HIM. 

Because of corona, we have to stay with this vindictive bitch and its bringing back a lot of past trauma. we cant work rn bc she doesn't want us to be exposed to too many ppl.


My point in making this post was to put out there that if you're in a similar situation, you aren't alone. i'm slowly losing myself but i'm hanging on in hope we can get to our safe haven.",domesticviolence
My boyfriends sister hit me during lockdown,"
So when lockdown was announced me (f22) and my boyfriend (m24) decided that I would spend it at his house where he lives with his mum and sister. His mum was fine with this as we get on well, his sisters boyfriend would also be staying and spending his days in the house as he and I both can’t work. My boyfriend and his sister are both essential workers. 

My boyfriends sister has never liked me and has previously informed my boyfriend ‘I’m not bothering with her because I tried with all the rest and they all go in the end’. So after that comment I’ve tried not to get in her way or join in too much in her conversation. 

About 2/3 weeks into lockdown it all kicked off, we were all in the kitchen at the time and my boyfriend was making general conversation that they were either ignoring or giving short answers too, he ended up asking his sister why we’d been blocked on all social media and what the problem was. Firstly they started saying to leave it alone and that she’s done with him, then she was shouting calling me a bitch and a cow, saying that I’m a creep because she can’t hear me coming down the stairs. 

As this was happening I was stood across the opposite side to them in the kitchen, stunned for words, his sister is 6ft so when she kicks off everyone’s frightened. Then she started to say I couldn’t speak for myself and I was stood there ‘like butter wouldn’t melt’ so I simply said to her ‘at least I’m not a (bad word)’like you. 

They both then barged past me through the door, she elbowed my arm then made a fist and punched the side of my face, I think if she’d hit my eye I definitely would’ve had a black eye. I was left holding my face in shock as they went upstairs and my boyfriend followed them up to defend me. 

Since then we were able to go to a family members house that was empty to quarantine together alone. The empty house now needs to be sold so we’re back living above his sister. The day before we came back she sent this text;

“Mum mentioned you and (my name) are coming back home, I’m sorry for what happened. Can we at least try and be civil whilst we are in lockdown together? Me and (her boyfriend) have been civil with mum, I hope we can do the same- without arguments. I hope you and (my name) are doing ok? And work has not been too stressful for you? Stay safe and see you soon. “

Tbh I just found this to be a further slap in the face, a half assed apology for ‘what happened’ not that she hit me? Not that she makes everyone so frightened we had to leave? My boyfriend ended up not replying as he didn’t want to rock the boat before we got back. It’s been six days now and we haven’t even crossed paths, I’m not looking forward to it. His sister is famous for not apologising and completely believes in herself, as well as her boyfriend who just goes along so he’s not in her war path. 

I’m not sure I can ever forgive her, and Id like to know what others would’ve done in mine and my boyfriends position? 

TL;DR! My boyfriends sister hit me, and we’ve come back after a month of living in a separate house to her pretending like it never happened with no real apology. I’m not sure I can ever forgive her.

EDIT: sorry had to remove a suggestion of a bad word!!!",domesticviolence

Witnessing domestic abuse as a young teen [TRIGGER WARNING],"Hello everyone,

I am not sure if this is the place I could post about my situation, because I have not really been the one that's gone through the physical abuse part, but I was a witness of it for a few years back when I was younger. I'm 20 now. When I was about 14, my dad started physically and emotionally abusing my mother, the emotional abuse had actually started way before that, but that's when it escalated to something else. 

I remember a lot of things very vividly. A lot of things I've heard that I should not have, I've seen a lot of things I shouldn't have. The abuse had started because my dad was a very jealous and possessive guy (what a surprise) and always had suspicions that my mom was cheating on him. So one day he brutally beats her up, parts of her hair were missing, she had a lot of bruises and was almost unrecognisable, avoiding to look at me. Many adults knew about the abuse from day 1 and no one offered a hand. I'm not saying I'm the victim here, obviously it's my mom that had it the worst. But it just breaks my heart and leaves me very conflicted about everything in my life. 

My father had been locking my mom, beating her, blackmailing her, throwing things at her, taking all her documents (because he was afraid she would run away or leave the country), he had made her write in a notebook about all her sexual encounters and then made her read it to us, while he would hit her after every sentence that he gets annoyed by. He threatened to cut her in parts and send her to her mom if she tries to run away or do anything without his permission. He drove all of us in a car while being completely drunk and hitting her while driving. 

I am COMPLETELY devastated and I really have no clue about what to do with myself. Not sure if therapy works, it always ends up being about me forgiving my father. And I am really not capable of that. I can't forgive a monster that ruined all of my family members' lives. I can't live with this.

I can't even fully have him out of my life, because they are still together (the physical abuse is not happening anymore), but I can't pretend to not remember anything and it's sort of made me get distanced from my mother as well. And I have so many things to tell her. That I've always been on her side, that I'll always protect her as much as I can and I want to say sorry for everything she's gone through. I'm also sorry if she sees him in me and that creates a bigger distance between us. But I understand it. 

I am so sorry, mom.",domesticviolence
Feeling forced to press charges &amp; potentially pregnant by my abuser,"Me[25F] and my ex[31M] had been together for about 9/10 years. I left him about 2 weeks ago. It’s been draining for me and right now I don’t see the light at the end of the tunnel. I feel sick without him, like my chest caves in every time I think about the fact that we’re over. I’m in a really tough situation right now because I think that I may be pregnant. While I was with him he would sometimes either beat me until I almost blacked out or waited until I was sleep to have unprotected sex with me. A year ago when I secretly got on birth control that didn’t go well and he made me stop taking it. I ended up getting pregnant and I miscarried at 10 weeks. I didn’t know I was pregnant until I miscarries. Ever since then he would have unprotected sex with me while I was sleep or almost unconscious. It’s really weird and traumatizing having to wake up to that. 

I have not taken a pregnancy test but I am sure I’m most likely pregnant. I have already had an abortion when I was 16 on top of the miscarriage last year. I am a red to get another abortion. I feel like karma or something will happen in the future when I do want kids By the right person. I still love him but I know it’s dumb to have a kid by him right now. I feel like another abortion is gonna cause issues. 

I am currently at my moms house and I told her about me potentially being pregnant and she was upset and disappointed. She’s been basically ignoring me since I’ve been here and I am scared of how she’ll react if I tell her that I want an abortion. I feel like I sound like a little girl but I really would like the support of my mother during this time. She’s very judgemental when it comes to things like this. Plus I disobeyed her trying to and ran away with him when I turned 18 after dealing with him as a teen. She told me not to repeatedly but I didn’t listen. 

I feel like I put myself in a stupid situation. My mom says that if I don’t press charges on him while I still have “proof” (bruises, scars, etc.) then I will have to leave. I understand but I am just not ready to do that. I don’t want to press charges just yet. I’m not planning on going back to him but I’m not in the right headspace  to do all of this.

I just feel like this heartbreak won’t ever end. He’s called me numerous times and his last text said that he’ll give me my space but we’re goin got talk. I haven’t responded to him. I’m thinking about showing my mom that I haven’t spoken to him and that I’ll block his number. Just to give her some faith that I won’t go back and hopefully she’ll get off my back about making a report.

I guess I just needed to vent because I don’t have a specific question but I would appreciate any advice.",domesticviolence

Abusive and arrested.. why do I feel so bad?,"My husband has been abusive for years, even stabbed me a few years ago and found himself in court.. obviously I relented, believed the lies he had changed, failed to attend the court case and accepted him back. It took months and the abuse started again. Fast forward a few years.. the abuse continued and again he threatened to stab and kill me, hurt me in front of a bunch of my friends. Someone rang the police, I didn’t press charges but, I didn’t need to. My neighbour reported the ongoing abuse.. even giving times and dates. 
For weeks now, with him gone I have felt free. Even cleared the house of his belongings. The police have deemed me high risk, changed my locks/ put devices on my door to prevent him forcing entry. 
For weeks I have felt strong, capable and able. 
Tonight, I feel deflated, low and lonely. Why is this?? I recorded many nights where he verbally abused me, pushed me, hit me. I have listened to them early on when I felt low, but why has this hit me tonight? It’s like a never ending battle.

10 year wedding anniversary,"Hi all,

I'm new here. I've been divorced from my abusive ex husband for 7.5 years. In a lot of ways I'm still in recovery from it even though I'm remarried. Friday would have been my 10 year anniversary to him. Originally my plan was to do a big road trip with three friends that have helped me recover but thanks to coronavirus that's obviously not happening. My current husband is very encouraging and supportive, but he doesn't fully understand why this day is such a big deal to me. Does anyone have any recommendation on how to explain to him why that day is important to me? And does anyone else celebrate this day?

"Was this abuse, or just a family joke","I feel like I was abused but I'm not sure if it was abuse or just something different.

I used to live in a house with the abusive stepfather, and abusive brother, AB is something like 24 and ASF is like 36. On numerous occasions AB has hit me, and choked me until I passed out and at one point he even tried to stab me, he missed his shot what was going towards my stomach but it slit my wrist and I still have that scar to this day, AB abuse was much more private and it only stayed inside of the house, however ASF was not bothered about abusing me in public. One time me and ASF were crossing this field where he choked me until I passed out and left me there stranded, in the middle of nowhere. Another time we were out shopping and ASF bought three bottles of washing up liquid and he forced me to drink one of them, like he shoved the cap inside of my mouth and would just keep squirting it inside of my mouth and if I spat it out he would punch me in the stomach, so I had no other choice but to swallow the washing up liquid.

Those were just a few times about my story and I just don't know whether it was abuse or just some sort of family joke thing.

My lawyer told me not to answer the door. Can the police break my door down?",domesticviolence
Scared and alone,"I have never posted before and never thought this would be the reason for my first post. Backstory is...my husband and I only got married 5 months ago (but together for 8 years). I can say there has been emotional abuse along the way. He is the king of the silent treatment (weeks). 

I have a quick temper that I work on but sometimes I regress. One such time was 3 weeks ago. Husband carries a lot of anger because he hated his job. He likes to take it out on me by nitpicking. On this occasion I snapped a little, grabbed his arm and angrily told him to give it a rest. 
Totally immediately apologized for grabbing him and meant it. Mind you nothing close to this has happened before, my temper is quick, verbal, and fleeting. He said never do it again, said I won't and again, so so sorry. 

He retreats to basement and since we have different schedules, it is easy to avoid each other. I genuinely feel bad, I write him notes, bake him lots of things, send him emails. Nothing. 

Now to last night. I'm dead asleep in bed, after 3 weeks of silence (but I'm still cooking for him, packing his lunches, etc) he charges in screams a bunch of stuff, one being I want a divorce. Slams door. Not a minute later, comes back, spits in my face and again says he wants a divorce. Minutes later comes back once more, chokes me, hits me in the face, and then punches and breaks my mirror. 

Now I know I started this, but I don't understand what makes someone that took 3 weeks to think about it go into a sudden rampage. Aside from the occasional play fight where he got a little overzealous he has never hit me before. He could have asked for a divorce without all of this. 

I left and stayed with someone because I was scared. But I know we have to talk even if it is just talking terms of getting out of this marriage. So I'm back home now and he will be home in about 2 hours. I'm waiting up so we can talk when he gets home. But I'm terrified right now. I can't just move out, I work from home. And everything is combined so there will have to be a lot of talking at some point. 

I don't expect anyone to read this whole long ass post but I'm scared, alone, and don't know what to do.",domesticviolence
The person taken from me,"TW: Self harm/suicide attempts 

Hi all, I posted on here about a week ago about my abusive brother and the effects it had on me, some of these include PTSD, depression, anxiety, borderline personality disorder, and alcoholism. Today I thought the same thing I’ve questioned every day for years and finally decided to ask if anyone else can relate. Do you ever wonder who you would be if things were different? 

If I had a happy childhood would I be able to sleep at night without drinking until I black out? Would I be able to speak openly to my chosen family  who love me? Would I never have developed the fear that someone is always right behind me, breathing over my shoulder and watching me? Would I never have tried to slit my wrists or overdose on pills? Would I be able to get out of bed instead of lying there when the flashbacks overwhelm me? 

I’m so angry by this imaginary version of myself I fantasize was stolen from me. I just want to be okay.",domesticviolence
"Male Victim, looking for journalistic efforts","I am a male victim of domestic violence, and am looking for someone to help tell my story.  I successfully won primary custody initially and transitioned custody over time due to economic circumstances.",domesticviolence
First time,"I’m at a loss about this. I’ve been married to my husband 15 years. We’ve been together 18 years. We rarely argue or fight but when we do, it’s pretty heated.  Well, last month, he became violent for the first time ever. 

He’s intensely stressed out with Covid as he’s a frontline physician in the hospital. He also has PTSD from the of death of his parents at a young age and they were alcoholics and fought all the time. So he gets anxious and panicky over the thought of loosing his family (I know no excuse) and that’s what he’s been most worried over with the pandemic is getting sick and dying or bringing it home to us and we get sick and die.

Anyway- during the fight he was screaming in my face that I’m a dumb bitch and stupid because I wasted $3 on the kids on Easter grass when we already had Easter grass and there’s millions of people without work, going to drive up food banks. He told me we had some and when I went out to get the Easter goodies, I bought it because I didn’t see any in the Easter box in storage. He admitted it wasn’t about the $3 grass but that I didn’t listen to him. I told him he was being abusive and needs to stop calling me names but he kept ranting. He finally got in my face with his finger pointing in my face swearing and yelling. I hit his hand away with my left hand (I’m right handed) and he ended up grabbing me by the hair and throwing me down and shaking me up and down  and threatened to kill me.  I know I should have walked away to my room but I didn’t.  The next day, I went to the ED to get X-rays because my clavicle hurt and I was concerned it might be broken. I had to drive out of state to get to a hospital that my health insurance would cover and that wasn’t his work place. I had bruises on me for 10 days after on my arms and fingers. 

He’s never made a threat to hurt me beyond threats to divorce me. He’s called me names before..maybe 3x since I’ve ever known him and it never happened before we got married. I know I wouldn’t have married him if he had. My mother left my dad when I was 1.5 years old because he became violent with her so she raised me to not accept anything like that. I never been in a physically violent relationship before. 

I don’t trust him anymore. I don’t want to live a life walking on egg shells. I don’t see a lot changing.  He’s in a stressful job that he dislikes. He’s not hit the kids but he’s threatened our son and has gotten in his face threatening to knock his lights out to get him to do what he wants or to punish or scare him. Anyway—- does this sound like escalating abuse?

I keep researching  for stats on repeat offending because I suspect once someone crosses that line, it’s hard to not do it again. I realize it’s very much about being in control of us and he probably thinks he’s being protective of us. His friends have died or diagnosed with cancer etc and as we age, it’s just going to keep happening with the loss of friends etc and sensing our own mortality. I  don’t know if I can trust him ever again to be able to handle stress without getting so angry and violent. 

I don’t think he will harm me any time right now. But I’ve started to take precautions just in case I need to leave quickly. I have a bag packed and in the car and the kids clothes packed. I changed my password in my phone. We long have had separate bank accounts.I have cash in a locked cabinet in my private office at work. So I think I’m good there. 

He tells me that he started to go to therapy at my insistence and I saw the insurance copay bill come in the mail so I know he attended an appt (TeleHealth) with the therapist at least once since then. But what’s the chances of him never doing this again? 

When he let go of me, he said “how many times have you hit me?” Which was totally to gaslight me. I’ve never hit him before and he’s apparently taking me batting his hand out of my face as hitting him which is both concerning and manipulative when he was being aggressive.   The other thing that was concerning is when I asked him how his therapy session go and what did the therapist say, he responded with “he acted like it was the 20th tome he heard my story today”. I felt like he was trying to normalize and justify becoming abusive. 

So my questions are: 
(1) does this sound like the pattern or escalating abuse? 
(2) what are the chances of someone becoming physically violent again? I know this is a national emergency but still...",domesticviolence
"My mom is forcing me (24f) to leave my job, home, and boyfriend (25m).","Sorry for the long title, second apology for the upcoming long post. 

I meant Jon 6 months ago and immediately fell in love. Soulmate status. I felt like I had finally found my forever person. 
We had only been dating two months when this pandemic hit. Due to our seasonal life, we both lost our jobs, and Jon lost his housing. Things were going well between us, so I told him just to move in with me. 

About a week later, Jons best friend committed suicide. This was hard for both of us, but especially hard for him. Jon has bipolar disorder and spiraled. It got to the point where I had to bring him to the ER and he was put on a psych hold for three days. 

When he came back, he still wouldn’t really talk about his friend, but said he didn’t want to drink anymore because it makes him too sad. We were sober for about a week before he said he wanted to have some beers. We both got drunk, and he started crying, and when I was trying to console him I said “this is something that you’ll eventually move on from”, and he got mad. Like, really mad. He got physically violent with me. I vented to some friends about it, and one of the friends told my little brother who told me to leave. I didn’t want to, because I knew just how much shit Jon was going through at the time and I forgave him. 

Flash forward to a few days ago. It’s been MONTHS of quarantine and we finally have an opportunity to get back to work, but we have to move. So on the move, we stop at his friends bar along the way. I got drunk. Jealous about his female friend telling me all about how they used to pretend to date so they could have housing together. And I went to the car packed with all of our stuff and tried to drive away. Jon tried to grab my keys but in my drunken rage I hit him, so he choked me. I screamed, the cops came to the bar, and I asked them to separate us for the night because I was drunk and angry. 

I called my mom and told her about it. And about the first time. I told her how angry I was, how I wasn’t sure I wanted to be with someone who would do that to me, and she agreed. 
Jon and I met for breakfast the next morning and talked through things, we both apologized for our overreactions, and continued the move to our new job. 
We get to the job and it is beautiful. And we would finally have an income, some purpose in the days, a beautiful property, and free housing and food. 

I got there, and I found out that my mom was sending my brother on a 12 hour drive to come get me, and that if I didn’t leave the job that day she was going to send family friends in the area to come get me “away from Jon”. And if I didn’t leave, she would call my employer and tell them everything. 
To stop any huge scene from happening, Jon and I unpacked our belongings and moved him in, and put all of my things back in the car and I had to drive away and leave the job and my boyfriend. 

She is making me come home, which is 2,500 miles away, and go to counseling because she thinks I’ve been brainwashed into staying in this relationship with someone who she views as some manipulative abuser. 

This is because I drunkenly called and vented to my mom. I no longer have a choice on where I can work, live, or do with my life, because she threatened Jons life and livelihood. 

How the hell can I convince my mother to let me stay on the west coast with him at the job I want to be working when she just thinks I’ve been being abused? 

I drove two hours away and spent the night in a hotel or my brother was going to keep driving through the night to ‘get’ me. 

TL;DR - Boyfriend and I had a physical altercation, and my mother gave me no choice but to drive 2,500 miles or she would ruin the life of my boyfriend. I don’t want to leave. It all feels like a gross overreaction.",domesticviolence
Not entirely sure what to do,"I'm in a relationship that began a couple months ago. She's generally sweet and our relationship is fairly good. She has had some unfortunate relationships in the past, including one that was emotionally abusive and the guy even hit her in the face in front of her family.. Having said that, there have been a couple instances that make me anxious and I'm unsure of how to proceed. 

Instance 1 - We had a group of friends come over and she get incredibly drunk and blacked out part of the night. She was incredibly emotional and at multiple times told her best friend she doesn't think I care about her while I was standing 6 feet away each time. I had even invited her best friend over because of how sad she (my gf) was feeling that her friend wasn't there. There were some other inappropriate things that night and I told her that I wasn't comfortable with that. The next morning I told her that I wanted her to go back to therapy.

Instance 2 - After a night of drinking, we facetimed her best friend as we were closed to going to bed. During the conversation I made an off-hand reference to my gf's ex about how I didn't remember his name because I had been drunk when I met him. My girlfriend's face turned incredibly angry and she tried to choke me with one hand, and when I took her hand off my neck she tried with the next hand. This was while her friend was on the phone. She hung up shortly after. I told my girlfriend that if she ever did that again that we were done. She said it happened because her ex's name triggered a bunch of her past memories, but that she wasn't trying to make that an excuse for what happened.  She still slept over that night because I couldn't bring myself to tell her to leave...

Instance 3 - We went to a friend's house and the night was going great. At a certain point were were sort of alone and she had her hand around my neck, which in a normal world I don't see that as a bad thing (just like a normal hands on the head / neck which would be comforting in some situations). But she went ahead and applied a little bit of pressure all the while having a really jokey face. I told her to not do that ever and she said she was sorry and I don't really remember the rest of the conversation because I was upset and drunk. She did say she wouldn't do it again.

I'm a guy and I feel incredibly weird about this. When I told my best friend this he said he was scared for me. I don't really feel 'scared' physically, but I do feel anxious just because I don't know how much of her reaction of going to therapy or saying that she won't do that again is truly real. It complicates things more when we both share the same friends from before we were together.  I've talked to my therapist about this but it doesn't feel like it's helping. I apologize if this is sort of scattered. 

tl;dr my girlfriend choked me briefly because i made an off-hand comment about an ex. she has apologized and is going to therapy but I feel incredibly weird about this.",domesticviolence
Advice Wanted,"I need urgent advice. I’m planning on leaving my abusive husband of 5 years and I need tips on doing so. The abuse has really crippled me emotionally and I’m planning on leaving him today when he leaves for work. Today he attacked me again after 9 months of abuse.

Question about domestic violence,"I got in a fight with my husband the other day. We have been together for 27 years. There has been some historical violence in our past and usually occurs just a few times a year. I’m not sure if it’s my fault. There a three sides to every story so I’ll try my best to make sure I state everything. Usually an argument starts about something stupid like why I opened the curtains when he just closed them even tho I didn’t know that. I told him that I just wanted some sunshine and I opened the curtains. He told me that I was being defiant and not obeying him like I said I would during our marriage vows. I apologized and said that I didn’t know he had just closed the curtains. That went on for about 10 minutes. I walked away and went to bed to cool off as I couldn’t handle the conversation of me being disobedient cuz I really didn’t think that I was and I was really going to lay into him about the whole “I shall obey my husband” speech. I k we better than to get started on that conversation. He came up to see me about 10 minutes later and laid on the bed with me. He started to talk calmly about it with me and then started with how disobedient I am and how defiant I am towards him all the time. He starting laying I. To me about it and was really pushing my buttons to the point I was seeing red and was going to punch him. I started to feel threatened and really angry so I kicked his leg to push him out of my way. It was not hard but I still kicked him. He then grabbed me by my hair, lifted me off there best and threw me face down in to the bed. He had my arm behind my back and was pulling my hair so hard that my neck was bending towards my back.  I could feel the muscles pulling in my back. I told him he was being an asshole and I didn’t care that he thought I was disobedient or defiant and that he could f himself. I couldn’t move or do anything to physically get out of the situation. He made me repeat what I said and if I didn’t he would pull harder on my arm and my hair. So I said it. He then flipped me over on to my back and was sitting on top of me. He had his hands around my throat and his knees on my arms. He had my legs pinned under his somehow. I couldn’t move. He looked at me and told me he was going to rape me and that I would probably like it. I started crying and he got off of me and let me go. I started to walk away and then he starts telling me again what a disobedient bitch I am and that I broke my promise to God. I got in his face and told him he was a dick and he can go f himself. He started yelling at me some more so I slapped him. He then started choking me and threw me on the floor. Eventually I just lay there and let him continue as in the past it always made him ease up. He did and let me go. I left the room and went to another room. He came to see me and started talking with me. Asking me why I keep letting this happen to us. I don’t know why I do. I don’t know I started the argument. I shouldn’t have kicked him. I should have used my words like a normal person. I have a temper and I know I do and being enraged when I can’t get my words out is a very volatile situation for me. I tried my best to calm the situation but it seemed that he was trying to get me mad on purpose. He would ask me questions and I give him my honest answer and it never matters what I say, it’s wrong and I am being defiant. I guess I’m just frustrated with never being able to give a right answer to him to make him happy. Is this all my fault? Did I start it because I disagree with some of things he says and then kicked him when he pushed my buttons? I’m so confused. I know I started the violence, I just need to learn to control it.",domesticviolence

"Legal Advice if possible for Domestic violence!! I have questions, but no place is picking up the phone at the moment .","I'm 22 years old and my ex abusive partner is 25 years old. He had beat me relentlessly and I went to the police before and they got a warrant for his arrest for Domestic battery and Strangulation. I went back to him the next day because I felt guilty and felt like I was ruining someone's life by sending them to jail. His dad also messaged me and said getting the police involved was Bs... I felt terrible. My partner called me names at first and then said he was sorry and didn't blame me and he needed help. The police were looking for him but he went into hiding. I went back to him the very next day and he slammed my head against the car window and called me names and said everything is my fault for the way his life is. He also beat an ex girlfriend and she got a protective order against him. Then the coronavirus happened and he got a new job and he still repeatedly beat me. I became pregnant and he even knew and he still beat me and I'm tired of it and he even admitted he needed help and he threatened to kill me and the baby and 3 days ago he had me cornered and said with one punch to my stomach he could kill my baby and no one would have the evidence to prove it. I have an extensive amount of proof against him and I'm tired of living in fear and no legal place is picking up my phone call and I need some help. 

My question is can I speak to the police to pick him up and tell them my situation again? or do I fill out the protection order for now and just see what happens?

TEMPORARY HOUSING OPTION!!,"Hello to all of you wonderful strong people. After a lot of thought I’ve decided to offer my Los Angeles apartment as temporary housing for someone in a difficult situation at a reduced rate. 

I’m currently quarantining with my family, back and forth between the Bay Area and San Diego. My apartment is likely going to be empty until WFH is over. 

A bit about the apartment - it’s located in Koreatown and is about 680 square feet. No roommates. Full bathroom with bathtub, kitchen, washing machine, dryer, dishwasher, TV, WiFi, balcony. I also have some food in the freezer which I can leave for you to use. Just take care of my plants &lt;3 

If you’re interested please send me a PM. I’m a lawyer and I can write us up a contract. I really want to use this empty space to help someone who needs it.

EDIT with more info: there’s also an assigned parking space, pets are allowed with a deposit (the apartment complex imposes the deposit not me), and it’s close to a lot of grocery stores! I’ll be leaving all of my cookware, furniture, and cleaning supplies for you to use. 

I’d really love to help someone out so rent &amp; time period would be negotiable~ 
I’ll be away for at least the summer.

Also, I am a woman who used to be in an emotionally abusive relationship, so I am understanding! I want to help someone. 

IF THIS POST GETS A HIGH RESPONSE RATE - I’m not sure if it will - then I’ll be responding in order of people who reply.",domesticviolence
MIL and domestic violence,"My mother In law is getting out of control and I am so conflicted. She keeps calling me childish and pretty much telling me I’m lying about her sons abuse, she stated “there’s always two sides to the story” but there truly only is one. I am getting so emotional just writing this. She believes that I instigate my husband and that’s why he used to hit me and beat the shit out of me. I WAS SLEEPING when he came home and started to brutally beat me. I am so in shock. She keeps telling me to figure it out cause someone needs to watch our kids so I can go back to work and drop the restraining order because she’s not going to be driving back and forth the kids. Mind you I haven’t even asked her at all. Am I in the wrong? How could I be in the wrong wanting to stay protected against my abuser? I just don’t get it. I’m so emotionally drained that I can’t even stand up for myself. My abuser is in jail and she talks to him everyday so I don’t even tell her anything because I know she’ll pass it along to him.

Should I file for a PPO? I’m lost at what to do,"I’m still living with my sorta ex-bf during this COVID time. For context on the sorta, we talked about a month ago about how once our lease is up that we’re going to go separate ways. We’ve been having issues for a while now, but we decided to be civil with each other and live together until the end of July or until one of us can find a new place. He said he would help me with moving and that maybe we could try to see where life takes us once we move into different locations. 
This morning my entire perspective on our situation changed. We have a cat that I adopted when we were together, however I adopted her under my name and she’s legally my cat because he wasn’t at the shelter when I adopted her. We already agreed that she is mine and is going to live with me after all this stuff was said and done. She usually meows early in the morning to play or for food. This morning he lost his shit. Picked her up and threw her onto the bed and then tried smothering her with a pillow. I screamed at him and told him if he did it again I was calling the police. He responded by saying I was being dramatic and to stop crying. (He often gaslights me during our conversations)
I was so freaked out that I ended up bringing her to work with me because he’s currently working from home remotely during this while I still have to go in. Luckily my bosses were super chill and understanding. I just didn’t want to leave her alone with him for the fear that he might hurt her. When I was leaving he was like “I’m not gonna fuckin kill her”  
While this is the first time he’s done something to her it isn’t the first time he’s been violent. There’s been many times where he would grab my wrists or my legs to the point of bruising. He’s also sexually assaulted me multiple times throughout our relationship. 
I’m planning on moving out ASAP and already have things set up, but I still have to wait a few weeks. I started packing as soon as I got back today so I can leave as soon as I can get into my new place. 
Should I file for a PPO against him? If so should I do it now or as soon as I move out? I’m just completely broken at lost at what I should do right now. I’m definitely calling the police if things escalate or if he does anything else to her. I just don’t know what other options I have right now.",domesticviolence

I don’t understand what’s going on,"I’m sorry, this turned into a longer post than I first intended!

So yesterday, I (f29) made dinner for my partner (m29). I worked the night shift and gotten a few hours of sleep through the day so I was pretty tired by dinner time. 
He got home, after going work and then hanging out with his brother. We had dinner and I got up to clear the plates. He said thank you multiple times and dinner was very nice.
I asked him cheekily if he’s so grateful maybe he could give me a hand clearing up? And he said he didn’t wanna get up so soon after eating and I was like okay sure I understand.
I took the plates into the kitchen and a few mins later he came into the kitchen too I didn’t see what he did though coz I had my back to him.
I honestly thought he was gonna help me tidy up a bit.. but then he sat back down and when I turned looked he was sitting there rolling up a smoke while I tidied up. 
I sat back down in the living and I felt a bit down coz I guess I was left to tidy up while he was rolling a smoke?!
Anyway I didn’t say anything and he asked what was wrong so I said it would’ve been nice if you helped tidy up a bit while you were up anyway and he got super defensive so I just said okay cool and just left it alone and watched tv
And then he asked why I was so closed off and I’m like what dyu mean, and he just started ranting at me? 
He got seriously angry and started calling me a motherfucker, a cunt, he got up and went to the bedroom and slammed the door. He shouting at in the bedroom just abuse
He said I had an ego because I couldn’t clear the plates after him and I was a little person who was always unhappy 
After a while.. I called him and said look can we talk about this i dont know why you’re so angry and he told me to fuck off and said he’s not gonna talk to me 
And then later.. I was in bed and he came in talking about how I’m never happy, I always make him feel bad and take his self esteem away. He said he dreads coming home to me and doesn’t wanna be with me anymore etc etc so I let him and speak and then when I tried to reply, he told me to Fuck off and shut the door on me

Can someone explain what the hell just happened? I have no idea what I did to deserve that.. I didn’t even raise my voice or swear back

He slept in the living room.. and when he woke up he was slamming doors while I was still sleeping, he left the living in such a state aswell.. empty coke bottles and glasses, his clothes dumped, the coffee table covered in crumbs and tobacco bits 

I called him and asked him he’s being so nasty, while he didn’t even clean up a bit ? And he just got super defensive again saying things that didn’t been make sense and then hung up on me..

I'm afraid for my boyfriend's safety [URGENT],"I am losing my mind. We live in different city, we are both quarantining with our families and we are university students in a third city. I know that his father has been been physically violent with him all his life but he doesn't go home often because of that but now because of the virus he had to.

We were arguing literally all night on the phone about unimportant stuff and stress, suddenly around 7 a.m. he hangs up. He calls me again after like 10 minutes and says that his father burst in his room so he had to hang up. Okay, we continue talking we finally start to reach to an agreement about our fight when around 8 a.m. he hangs up again. This time he calls me around 30-40 minutes later, he is crying. I ask him what's wrong he tells me that his parents were fighting the first time his father came in the room he took his phone and throw it on the ground and left the room. Then my boyfriend called me again, and the second time he hang up, his father came into his room again and hit him with some object on his mouth and broke one of his lower teeth.

So my boyfriend is crying I ask him to please go to a dentist it might be serious, he tells me he won't he just needs to stop the bleeding. He says his father left and that he feels better now he just needs to stop the bleeding. He says he'll leave tomorrow back to the city where we study at, he just needs to find a place to live very quickly, and he tells me he'll report his father to the police. I get scared and tell him that maybe he should do that after he leaves so that his father won't be able to do anything to him, because in our country the police doesn't do shit about domestic violence cases.

He says he doesn't care anymore even if his father beats him up completely but he has to call the police, and that he'll do it later. We talk some more, I try to keep his mind off of it maybe I made a mistake there. He then tells me around 9:30 a.m. that he'll start studying I ask him if he's okay he says yes we'll talk later, and we hang up. I know I'm awful I didn't do anything.

Then I massage him around 10 a.m. asking him how he's feeling if his tooth hurts and if he stopped the bleeding, he doesn't reply but it says that he's online and the messages I send are being delivered. I call him he doesn't answer, I call him a lot of times he doesn't answer, I text him, I message him on facebook he doesn't answer. Around 40 minutes later he goes offline, and his phone is turned off. Now it's been 3 hours, I keep calling him every 10 minutes it's still off. I don't know what to do I have no one to tell please help me I don't know what to do.",domesticviolence
How to be strong in the face of current family abuse?,"Im abused. Ive been and am now. Im 16, the abusers are my parents and older brother. They haven’t been physical for years, but they are still emotionally abusive. I said it before on reddit, but Id rather not describe what exactly Im going through. All I can say is that Im not suicidal, they may injure me (but as long as Im obedient this should happen), Im not sexually abused by them. For tens of thousands of reasons I can’t contact CPS. Im from Poland, I know how the system works here, I called the crisis lines, I know for a fact that outside help is out of the equation. The same goes for any sort of therapy or mental health help.

Ive been going through this for so long, in less than 2 years Ill be free. But its difficult. Its difficult for me to function like this. I hate waking up in this house. I hate having to come down for breakfast. I hate acting this happy child role (they screamed at me for being too sad and started threatening me). I know it sounds easy, but its not. 

Im loosing my mind. Im getting more and more aggressive. Im scared of becoming like them. What can I do to ensure my sanity survives in these conditions?",domesticviolence
"My boyfriend, (24M), raises his hand at me, (21F), as a joke.","So this started not too long ago, where he would ""jokingly"" raise his hand at me. I flinch and he says ""did you think I was going to hit you? I would never hit you.""


He knows how I grew up how my relationship with my parents isn't the greatest and dispite me flinching every time, he still does it. As a joke of course. 


There was many things that have happened over the past year of us living together.. for example: he asks me to do his laundry for him... but if they aren't done immediately after he asks he gets annoyed and does it himself while bitching about me not doing it. I will be doing homework for my college course when he asks. Adding to this, one night I got really drunk and kissed a female friend of mine as someone else who is closer to my boyfriend suggested it and my boyfriend said ""I wish I let you die last night."". I told him when I found out it was a thing that had happened as I did not remember it.  When I brought it up again he said it was just a joke. He was upset and it was a bad joke. I did not and still do not believe him that it was just a joke... not with the way he was looking at me and how angry he was about it.


I recently moved out and back in with roommates, he knows I get anxious when it comes to the "" I need to talk to you"" stuff. But that's the message he sent for me to come back over. When I got there ""its nothing now that you are here."", ""I dont want to talk about it anymore."" And ""I'm giving you an out."" 


I am still working on moving things out of his place. The place where he lives alone in a 3 bedroom apartment as he didnt want to move... but he makes it seem like my fault that he does not have any money. All I do is apologize for leaving him like that... dispite him having the option to move as well.


I no longer know what I want to do... maybe I want to see if things get better while we live separately. Maybe I shouldn't though... 


TL;DR: my relationship has been rocky over the past year living together. I feel he does things just to get a reaction out of me sometimes. He always wants me to do things on his time even though I'm busy doing something else. I moved out to see if things will get better.. so far they have not.

I'm feeling so guilty for calling the police,"Hi everyone, I just signed up to reddit because I need encouragement and support.
I've been married for 13 years and we have been through a lot together. Lots of good stuff and we have a strong bond. I used to say I was addicted to him. He says me and our son is his family. But there has always been abuse, both verbal and physical in our marriage. First I blamed it on him being younger (10 years younger) , then because I have more sexual experience than him, me being swedish and him muslim and I gave up everything for him. Changed my behave and country. For years it was better, only every few months would he be abusive and maybe only a couple of times per year violent. We were made homeless in January and got a flat shortly after that and then all hell broke lose. 
A month ago I had him arrested and the day after I gave a lengthy statement to the police and he could possibly face a long time in jail.
Now I'm being accused of being the only woman in the world that tells the police everything from 13 years ago.
I agree , maybe that wasn't necessary but I defend myself by saying if you hadn't done anything, I wouldn't have anything to say.
We are talking serious assults with broken .... And bruises

Help need opinions,"So I am a university student and currently since I was born, I've had an alcoholic father. Now why I am here is that lately, he's been way to violent with my mother, grandmother, and me. At this point, he is pulling the knife(multiple occasions) at me when he's done something violent and I have to use self-defense to get him to the ground. I've had to grab/push him away as he approaches my mom or grandmother like he's going to hit them multiple times. We've called the cops in the past when I was in elementary but it was never to this extent where a knife is being pulled out to stab me, more so its been him being drunk and breaking stuff when I was a kid. Now, why we haven't reported this is my parents/siblings are worried that if we call, he'd blame me for hitting him which provoked him, which will affect my file or something, which in the future prevents me from getting a government job here in Canada(as I'm aspiring to become the police and possibly move into cyber security)

I feel lost...,"This may be kinda long. I’m a 23 year old male. My mom and dad divorced when I was 2. My Dad cheated. They were both young and I believe that if they were a little older they would have worked it out. My mom married  another man when I was 7 and divorced him 5 years later, they fought constantly and the last straw was my mom hearing about him hitting on a girl at a bar. That summer she began dating my current step father. They have been married 10 years now. The first time he hit me, they had been together for maybe a year. There were quite a few times after that, maybe three or four a year for quite a while, every time he did it he was drunk. The last time he did it I was probably 19 and I broke his nose. Flash forward to today: my mom, stepdad, aunt, uncle, cousin and her husband went out on the lake and they were drinking all day. Some drama has been happening with my stepbrother and stepsister talking bad to my stepdad about my mom and blaming her for their problems; things that she has no control of. My mom helped them and has cared for them like they were her own kids the whole time. Well, some crap happened and they went to leave the island and the boat wouldn’t start. When my stepdad was trying to work on the motor he was so drunk he fell in the lake. He had already been swimming all day and was already wet so it shouldn’t have been a big deal. When he got back on the boat my mom jokingly said “want another beer clumsy?” Well he started the boat and drove off. My mom said that he was being hateful and they were arguing and when they got in the middle of the lake, he slammed her into the floor of the boat and proceeded to beat the shit out of her. The only reason he stopped was because some guys on another boat heard my mom screaming and went over there and got him off of her and brought my mom on their boat. My mom has swollen knots all over her head and scratches and bruises all over her arms and legs. He fled and nobody has seen him. For a while I was certain that I would kill him if I found him, but now I would just like to see his ass rot in jail. Problem is, he’ll likely stay for 2 hours and be out again. My mom is divorcing him now but I can’t help but feel lost. These past 10 years me and my mom have lived in hell, and for what??? I dealt with so much more than just him hitting me as a kid. His son is my age and he would constantly put me down, bully me, steal girls from me, and pick fights. I believed that it would get better but now... why in the hell did we even bother with them??? Knowing what I know now, what was the purpose? There are so many different things I could say but this is a long enough post. Idk why I typed this, just have to tell someone and get it off my chest I guess. Thanks for reading.",domesticviolence
Domestic Violence case thrown out,"I’ve been married to my husband for 7 years. He has gotten physical with me at least 5 times. He has seriously hurt me twice. This last time, he called the cops because the neighbors heard him hitting me. His plan was to tell the cops I was hitting him. It didn’t work out how he had hoped, and he was arrested. He had punched me in the face multiple times and body slammed me to the ground. I had a bruise on my cheek and forehead and a big mark on my back. 
I was glad to finally get justice that I had always been too scared to get for myself. Yesterday my husband got a letter in the mail telling him the DA was dropping the charges for lack of evidence. I think they really dropped it because of Covid. The courts are closed and the date was supposed to be rescheduled but it was thrown out instead. 
I still live with my husband. I feel so angry all the time. I have no family left. I lost my mom in December and she was my whole life.

Triggers.,"Here's a little something I wrote.

Disclaimer:

I am not justifying domestic violence, I am someone who has been on both the receiving and giving end of it. If you or anyone you know is going through abuse, call the police and seek help asap.

Triggers.

You knew exactly what to say and what to do to trigger me, my weaknesses, my doubts, my fears, my insecurities. I begged you to stop, yelled, screamed, in pain from the bullets you were shooting into my heart. Yet you’d keep going. Switching the lights on one by one until the entire room was filled with a bright brilliance, the color of red. Then, Boom, just like someone pulled the trigger of an execution shot, I’d retaliate. By this point conscious thought no longer existed, only the survival of my precious ego. To this day, I still don’t know why you didn’t stop. Maybe it was my weakness that triggered you, made you continue even though you knew that we were only going to hurt each other. I’m sorry that my actions caused you pain, but you kept pulling the trigger over and over, even when you knew that it would set a fire in my soul that would be impossible to extinguish. I know my triggers now, because of you, I’ve worked every single day to rehabilitate, to understand how to pull myself out of any situation before the alarm bells ring. The triggers that you pulled, those shots no longer hurt. What is dead may never die.",domesticviolence
Package delivery at my home for my ex,"This is kind of a dumb, minor thing, but I had a package arrive via UPS today for my ex. Its heavy and seems like it may be expensive. He moved out about a year ago, and though he claims he did all the necessary address change stuff, I have continued to get mail addressed to him. I’ve always returned it to sender but its been so draining having to continue seeing his name and take time to do this. Thankfully this seems to finally have tapered off quite a bit recently, though that may just be the pandemic.

I recently started therapy for the effects of his emotionally and sexually abusive behavior toward me during our relationship, and over the last month or so I've blocked him on all forms of contact I’ve been able to think of. I haven’t had any contact with him since earlier this year.

I have zero desire to make contact with him to get him this stupid package. I also resent the idea of simply taking it to the UPS store, as that feels like he gets to just continue controlling my behavior and making me cater to his whims, even though I ended things a year ago.

I’m not entirely sure what to do here. I think since the package came via UPS and was never in the possession of USPS, it wouldn’t considered obstructing mail to simply do nothing. But would that be stooping to his level? I don't want to be malicious; I simply do not want to let him take any more from me, even if its just half an hour of my time and energy.",domesticviolence
Abusive and arrested.. why do I feel so bad?,"My husband has been abusive for years, even stabbed me a few years ago and found himself in court.. obviously I relented, believed the lies he had changed, failed to attend the court case and accepted him back. It took months and the abuse started again. Fast forward a few years.. the abuse continued and again he threatened to stab and kill me, hurt me in front of a bunch of my friends. Someone rang the police, I didn’t press charges but, I didn’t need to. My neighbour reported the ongoing abuse.. even giving times and dates. 
For weeks now, with him gone I have felt free. Even cleared the house of his belongings. The police have deemed me high risk, changed my locks/ put devices on my door to prevent him forcing entry. 
For weeks I have felt strong, capable and able. 
Tonight, I feel deflated, low and lonely. Why is this?? I recorded many nights where he verbally abused me, pushed me, hit me. I have listened to them early on when I felt low, but why has this hit me tonight? It’s like a never ending battle.

10 year wedding anniversary,"Hi all,

I'm new here. I've been divorced from my abusive ex husband for 7.5 years. In a lot of ways I'm still in recovery from it even though I'm remarried. Friday would have been my 10 year anniversary to him. Originally my plan was to do a big road trip with three friends that have helped me recover but thanks to coronavirus that's obviously not happening. My current husband is very encouraging and supportive, but he doesn't fully understand why this day is such a big deal to me. Does anyone have any recommendation on how to explain to him why that day is important to me? And does anyone else celebrate this day? I'm trying to do something nice for myself on this day",domesticviolence
"Was this abuse, or just a family joke","I feel like I was abused but I'm not sure if it was abuse or just something different.

I used to live in a house with the abusive stepfather, and abusive brother, AB is something like 24 and ASF is like 36. On numerous occasions AB has hit me, and choked me until I passed out and at one point he even tried to stab me, he missed his shot what was going towards my stomach but it slit my wrist and I still have that scar to this day, AB abuse was much more private and it only stayed inside of the house, however ASF was not bothered about abusing me in public. One time me and ASF were crossing this field where he choked me until I passed out and left me there stranded, in the middle of nowhere. Another time we were out shopping and ASF bought three bottles of washing up liquid and he forced me to drink one of them, like he shoved the cap inside of my mouth and would just keep squirting it inside of my mouth and if I spat it out he would punch me in the stomach, so I had no other choice but to swallow the washing up liquid.

Those were just a few times about my story and I just don't know whether it was abuse or just some sort of family joke thing.

Just some info I was 9-12 ( am 16 now) when I was living in that household and I tried telling the police about it when I was about 11 and they wouldnt believe me because they thought that I was just a kid making up a story for attention.",domesticviolence
Police and custody,"If one parent is withholding visitation from the other (for good reason but that’s another story), what can the police do?

Example: my psycho, abusive ex won’t follow the custody order and is refusing to tell me where he lives. But I guarantee he will call the police and flat out lie/twist everything to get them to side with him.

My lawyer told me not to answer the door. Can the police break my door down?",domesticviolence
Scared and alone,"I have never posted before and never thought this would be the reason for my first post. Backstory is...my husband and I only got married 5 months ago (but together for 8 years). I can say there has been emotional abuse along the way. He is the king of the silent treatment (weeks). 

I have a quick temper that I work on but sometimes I regress. One such time was 3 weeks ago. Husband carries a lot of anger because he hated his job. He likes to take it out on me by nitpicking. On this occasion I snapped a little, grabbed his arm and angrily told him to give it a rest. 
Totally immediately apologized for grabbing him and meant it. Mind you nothing close to this has happened before, my temper is quick, verbal, and fleeting. He said never do it again, said I won't and again, so so sorry. 

He retreats to basement and since we have different schedules, it is easy to avoid each other. I genuinely feel bad, I write him notes, bake him lots of things, send him emails. Nothing. 

Now to last night. I'm dead asleep in bed, after 3 weeks of silence (but I'm still cooking for him, packing his lunches, etc) he charges in screams a bunch of stuff, one being I want a divorce. Slams door. Not a minute later, comes back, spits in my face and again says he wants a divorce. Minutes later comes back once more, chokes me, hits me in the face, and then punches and breaks my mirror. 

Now I know I started this, but I don't understand what makes someone that took 3 weeks to think about it go into a sudden rampage. Aside from the occasional play fight where he got a little overzealous he has never hit me before. He could have asked for a divorce without all of this. 

I left and stayed with someone because I was scared. But I know we have to talk even if it is just talking terms of getting out of this marriage. So I'm back home now and he will be home in about 2 hours. I'm waiting up so we can talk when he gets home. But I'm terrified right now. I can't just move out, I work from home. And everything is combined so there will have to be a lot of talking at some point.

The person taken from me,"TW: Self harm/suicide attempts 

Hi all, I posted on here about a week ago about my abusive brother and the effects it had on me, some of these include PTSD, depression, anxiety, borderline personality disorder, and alcoholism. Today I thought the same thing I’ve questioned every day for years and finally decided to ask if anyone else can relate. Do you ever wonder who you would be if things were different? 

If I had a happy childhood would I be able to sleep at night without drinking until I black out? Would I be able to speak openly to my chosen family  who love me? Would I never have developed the fear that someone is always right behind me, breathing over my shoulder and watching me? Would I never have tried to slit my wrists or overdose on pills? Would I be able to get out of bed instead of lying there when the flashbacks overwhelm me? 

I’m so angry by this imaginary version of myself I fantasize was stolen from me. I just want to be okay.",domesticviolence

First time,"I’m at a loss about this. I’ve been married to my husband 15 years. We’ve been together 18 years. We rarely argue or fight but when we do, it’s pretty heated.  Well, last month, he became violent for the first time ever. 

He’s intensely stressed out with Covid as he’s a frontline physician in the hospital. He also has PTSD from the of death of his parents at a young age and they were alcoholics and fought all the time. So he gets anxious and panicky over the thought of loosing his family (I know no excuse) and that’s what he’s been most worried over with the pandemic is getting sick and dying or bringing it home to us and we get sick and die.

Anyway- during the fight he was screaming in my face that I’m a dumb bitch and stupid because I wasted $3 on the kids on Easter grass when we already had Easter grass and there’s millions of people without work, going to drive up food banks. He told me we had some and when I went out to get the Easter goodies, I bought it because I didn’t see any in the Easter box in storage. He admitted it wasn’t about the $3 grass but that I didn’t listen to him. I told him he was being abusive and needs to stop calling me names but he kept ranting. He finally got in my face with his finger pointing in my face swearing and yelling. I hit his hand away with my left hand (I’m right handed) and he ended up grabbing me by the hair and throwing me down and shaking me up and down  and threatened to kill me.  I know I should have walked away to my room but I didn’t.  The next day, I went to the ED to get X-rays because my clavicle hurt and I was concerned it might be broken. I had to drive out of state to get to a hospital that my health insurance would cover and that wasn’t his work place. I had bruises on me for 10 days after on my arms and fingers. 

He’s never made a threat to hurt me beyond threats to divorce me. He’s called me names before..maybe 3x since I’ve ever known him and it never happened before we got married. I know I wouldn’t have married him if he had. My mother left my dad when I was 1.5 years old because he became violent with her so she raised me to not accept anything like that. I never been in a physically violent relationship before. 

I don’t trust him anymore. I don’t want to live a life walking on egg shells. I don’t see a lot changing.  He’s in a stressful job that he dislikes. He’s not hit the kids but he’s threatened our son and has gotten in his face threatening to knock his lights out to get him to do what he wants or to punish or scare him. Anyway—- does this sound like escalating abuse?

I keep researching  for stats on repeat offending because I suspect once someone crosses that line, it’s hard to not do it again. I realize it’s very much about being in control of us and he probably thinks he’s being protective of us. His friends have died or diagnosed with cancer etc and as we age, it’s just going to keep happening with the loss of friends etc and sensing our own mortality. I  don’t know if I can trust him ever again to be able to handle stress without getting so angry and violent. 

I don’t think he will harm me any time right now. But I’ve started to take precautions just in case I need to leave quickly. I have a bag packed and in the car and the kids clothes packed. I changed my password in my phone. We long have had separate bank accounts.I have cash in a locked cabinet in my private office at work. So I think I’m good there. 

He tells me that he started to go to therapy at my insistence and I saw the insurance copay bill come in the mail so I know he attended an appt (TeleHealth) with the therapist at least once since then. But what’s the chances of him never doing this again? 

When he let go of me, he said “how many times have you hit me?” Which was totally to gaslight me. I’ve never hit him before and he’s apparently taking me batting his hand out of my face as hitting him which is both concerning and manipulative when he was being aggressive.   The other thing that was concerning is when I asked him how his therapy session go and what did the therapist say, he responded with “he acted like it was the 20th tome he heard my story today”. I felt like he was trying to normalize and justify becoming abusive. 

So my questions are: 
(1) does this sound like the pattern or escalating abuse? 
(2) what are the chances of someone becoming physically violent again? I know this is a national emergency but still...",domesticviolence
"My mom is forcing me (24f) to leave my job, home, and boyfriend (25m).","Sorry for the long title, second apology for the upcoming long post. 

I meant Jon 6 months ago and immediately fell in love. Soulmate status. I felt like I had finally found my forever person. 
We had only been dating two months when this pandemic hit. Due to our seasonal life, we both lost our jobs, and Jon lost his housing. Things were going well between us, so I told him just to move in with me. 

About a week later, Jons best friend committed suicide. This was hard for both of us, but especially hard for him. Jon has bipolar disorder and spiraled. It got to the point where I had to bring him to the ER and he was put on a psych hold for three days. 

When he came back, he still wouldn’t really talk about his friend, but said he didn’t want to drink anymore because it makes him too sad. We were sober for about a week before he said he wanted to have some beers. We both got drunk, and he started crying, and when I was trying to console him I said “this is something that you’ll eventually move on from”, and he got mad. Like, really mad. He got physically violent with me. I vented to some friends about it, and one of the friends told my little brother who told me to leave. I didn’t want to, because I knew just how much shit Jon was going through at the time and I forgave him. 

Flash forward to a few days ago. It’s been MONTHS of quarantine and we finally have an opportunity to get back to work, but we have to move. So on the move, we stop at his friends bar along the way. I got drunk. Jealous about his female friend telling me all about how they used to pretend to date so they could have housing together. And I went to the car packed with all of our stuff and tried to drive away. Jon tried to grab my keys but in my drunken rage I hit him, so he choked me. I screamed, the cops came to the bar, and I asked them to separate us for the night because I was drunk and angry. 

I called my mom and told her about it. And about the first time. I told her how angry I was, how I wasn’t sure I wanted to be with someone who would do that to me, and she agreed. 
Jon and I met for breakfast the next morning and talked through things, we both apologized for our overreactions, and continued the move to our new job. 
We get to the job and it is beautiful. And we would finally have an income, some purpose in the days, a beautiful property, and free housing and food. 

I got there, and I found out that my mom was sending my brother on a 12 hour drive to come get me, and that if I didn’t leave the job that day she was going to send family friends in the area to come get me “away from Jon”. And if I didn’t leave, she would call my employer and tell them everything. 
To stop any huge scene from happening, Jon and I unpacked our belongings and moved him in, and put all of my things back in the car and I had to drive away and leave the job and my boyfriend. 

She is making me come home, which is 2,500 miles away, and go to counseling because she thinks I’ve been brainwashed into staying in this relationship with someone who she views as some manipulative abuser. 

This is because I drunkenly called and vented to my mom. I no longer have a choice on where I can work, live, or do with my life, because she threatened Jons life and livelihood. 

How the hell can I convince my mother to let me stay on the west coast with him at the job I want to be working when she just thinks I’ve been being abused? 

I drove two hours away and spent the night in a hotel or my brother was going to keep driving through the night to ‘get’ me. 

TL;DR - Boyfriend and I had a physical altercation, and my mother gave me no choice but to drive 2,500 miles or she would ruin the life of my boyfriend. I don’t want to leave. It all feels like a gross overreaction.",domesticviolence
Not entirely sure what to do,"I'm in a relationship that began a couple months ago. She's generally sweet and our relationship is fairly good. She has had some unfortunate relationships in the past, including one that was emotionally abusive and the guy even hit her in the face in front of her family.. Having said that, there have been a couple instances that make me anxious and I'm unsure of how to proceed. 

Instance 1 - We had a group of friends come over and she get incredibly drunk and blacked out part of the night. She was incredibly emotional and at multiple times told her best friend she doesn't think I care about her while I was standing 6 feet away each time. I had even invited her best friend over because of how sad she (my gf) was feeling that her friend wasn't there. There were some other inappropriate things that night and I told her that I wasn't comfortable with that. The next morning I told her that I wanted her to go back to therapy.

Instance 2 - After a night of drinking, we facetimed her best friend as we were closed to going to bed. During the conversation I made an off-hand reference to my gf's ex about how I didn't remember his name because I had been drunk when I met him. My girlfriend's face turned incredibly angry and she tried to choke me with one hand, and when I took her hand off my neck she tried with the next hand. This was while her friend was on the phone. She hung up shortly after. I told my girlfriend that if she ever did that again that we were done. She said it happened because her ex's name triggered a bunch of her past memories, but that she wasn't trying to make that an excuse for what happened.  She still slept over that night because I couldn't bring myself to tell her to leave...

Instance 3 - We went to a friend's house and the night was going great. At a certain point were were sort of alone and she had her hand around my neck, which in a normal world I don't see that as a bad thing (just like a normal hands on the head / neck which would be comforting in some situations). But she went ahead and applied a little bit of pressure all the while having a really jokey face. I told her to not do that ever and she said she was sorry and I don't really remember the rest of the conversation because I was upset and drunk. She did say she wouldn't do it again.

I'm a guy and I feel incredibly weird about this. When I told my best friend this he said he was scared for me. I don't really feel 'scared' physically, but I do feel anxious just because I don't know how much of her reaction of going to therapy or saying that she won't do that again is truly real. It complicates things more when we both share the same friends from before we were together.  I've talked to my therapist about this but it doesn't feel like it's helping. I apologize if this is sort of scattered. 

tl;dr my girlfriend choked me briefly because i made an off-hand comment about an ex. she has apologized and is going to therapy but I feel incredibly weird about this.",domesticviolence

Question about domestic violence,"I got in a fight with my husband the other day. We have been together for 27 years. There has been some historical violence in our past and usually occurs just a few times a year. I’m not sure if it’s my fault. There a three sides to every story so I’ll try my best to make sure I state everything. Usually an argument starts about something stupid like why I opened the curtains when he just closed them even tho I didn’t know that. I told him that I just wanted some sunshine and I opened the curtains. He told me that I was being defiant and not obeying him like I said I would during our marriage vows. I apologized and said that I didn’t know he had just closed the curtains. That went on for about 10 minutes. I walked away and went to bed to cool off as I couldn’t handle the conversation of me being disobedient cuz I really didn’t think that I was and I was really going to lay into him about the whole “I shall obey my husband” speech. I k we better than to get started on that conversation. He came up to see me about 10 minutes later and laid on the bed with me. He started to talk calmly about it with me and then started with how disobedient I am and how defiant I am towards him all the time. He starting laying I. To me about it and was really pushing my buttons to the point I was seeing red and was going to punch him. I started to feel threatened and really angry so I kicked his leg to push him out of my way. It was not hard but I still kicked him. He then grabbed me by my hair, lifted me off there best and threw me face down in to the bed. He had my arm behind my back and was pulling my hair so hard that my neck was bending towards my back.  I could feel the muscles pulling in my back. I told him he was being an asshole and I didn’t care that he thought I was disobedient or defiant and that he could f himself. I couldn’t move or do anything to physically get out of the situation. He made me repeat what I said and if I didn’t he would pull harder on my arm and my hair. So I said it. He then flipped me over on to my back and was sitting on top of me. He had his hands around my throat and his knees on my arms. He had my legs pinned under his somehow. I couldn’t move. He looked at me and told me he was going to rape me and that I would probably like it. I started crying and he got off of me and let me go. I started to walk away and then he starts telling me again what a disobedient bitch I am and that I broke my promise to God. I got in his face and told him he was a dick and he can go f himself. He started yelling at me some more so I slapped him. He then started choking me and threw me on the floor. Eventually I just lay there and let him continue as in the past it always made him ease up. He did and let me go. I left the room and went to another room. He came to see me and started talking with me. Asking me why I keep letting this happen to us. I don’t know why I do. I don’t know I started the argument. I shouldn’t have kicked him. I should have used my words like a normal person. I have a temper and I know I do and being enraged when I can’t get my words out is a very volatile situation for me. I tried my best to calm the situation but it seemed that he was trying to get me mad on purpose. He would ask me questions and I give him my honest answer and it never matters what I say, it’s wrong and I am being defiant. I guess I’m just frustrated with never being able to give a right answer to him to make him happy. Is this all my fault? Did I start it because I disagree with some of things he says and then kicked him when he pushed my buttons? I’m so confused. I know I started the violence, I just need to learn to control it.",domesticviolence

"Psycho ex-boyfriend giving endless abuse, both physical and mental","Hi,

Writing this on behalf of my friend. She's been dealing with a crazy ex-boyfriend who's been physically and mentally abusing her for a long time now. She has a lot of struggles with self-harm and keeping herself happy, she doesn't have many friends and I'm the one who's has given her the support to leave this relationship she's been suffering in for so long. 

I continue to do this, however this dude is the definition of scum. He hacked her Discord and has made her paranoid online. She's made a new one, he found it. He even found out some of my personal information and has been emailing me the same nonsense threats as her. Things such as he's going to ""pay her back"", ""hurt her"", telling her she's better off dead. And that he won't stop until she's dead he said.

This is all fine and easy to ignore online, as he lives in another continent to her. However he has emailed me detailing he plans to fly over and to see her and ""give some pay back"". He's spamming my email, since I informed my friend of how to block him everywhere. So she doesn't know he plans to do this yet.

She lives with her family, but her family also mentally and physically abuses her. For instance, no matter how much she tells her mother they're broken up and etc. She still doesn't believe her and continues to ""support"" the relationship. He plans to contact the mother to have her bring him over. I have little doubt she'd actually do this and she's aware of the abuse in the relationship, as my friend has told her several times. 

My friend has no job, a very little amount of money (around $600), I'm the only positive support in her life it seems. She needs to escape from both her family and this man who wants her dead. In this situation, what can she do? She lives in California, the dude in Sweden. The girl is over 18.

Advice on finding a therapist [UK],"Hi, not sure if this is the right place to post this but I’m not sure where to find advice. 

I’m coming to the realisation that my marriage of 10 years is not just dysfunctional, but abusive. I don’t really have anyone to talk to about it or to work through things with. 

I have had two therapists in the past year, the first didn’t really gel with me and just kept telling me I should leave my husband if I didn’t like his behaviour, as if it was an easy thing to do after 10 years. The second has repeatedly warned me not to throw away my relationship and to work more on my marriage. 

We did couples therapy briefly and I found that we usually ended up talking about my behaviour rather than his. I was thinking about getting us back into it but from what I’ve read that’s not a good idea. 

How do I find a therapist who understands and who will help me work through the muddle in my head? I’ve tried searching therapist directories but I get loads of results if I filter for “abuse” and I can’t possibly call them all to see what their attitude to abuse is.

Has anyone gotten past violence?,"Hi,

I (f 25) find myself in a relationship with a man (m 25) who is generally kind, loving and fiercely loyal. For the most part we have a good relationship and have a lot of fun together, and we started up a share house together which has been a joy. We just celebrated our 2yr anniversary. At the beginning of the relationship we both showed abusive tendancies (me, control and jealousy. Him, violence) we both went to therapy and worked on ourselves, which went well! We didn't have any incidence of violence in three months. However we had an incident the other day.

We had just finished watching a movie together and he went and turned the light on. I said it hurt my eyes and went and turned it off. He then said he needed it on and turned it on again and I then turned it off. He then turned it on and restrained my hands. I asked him to let go, then I yelled for him to let go, then I went to kick him to let me go. He then hit me hard on the back. 

A good compromise would have been for us to turn the lamp on but at the time neither of us could communicate that. I'm scared now that this violence happened that we're not as recovered as I thought. Has anyone here been able to get past violence in a relationship or have any advice on whether an unhealthy relationship can become healthy? 

TL,DR: my boyfriend hit me after a period of non violence. Has anyone moved past violence into a healthy relationship?",domesticviolence
Preparing to start over after leaving my emotionally abusive relationship,"I am preparing to move out of my ex's house this week, we had been together for almost three years, in which he was EXTREMELY emotionally abusive. I had been done with the relationship since February, right when I started job hunting so I could find work and move out the pandemic hit and I been waiting around for things to improve before I moved out. I booked myself an air bnb for a month to give myself time and space to plan out where I am going to go from here. I want to apply for low income housing, food stamps etc but I wouldn't have an address and I don't know anyone in the area that I am moving to. I had moved to Alabama with my ex since he got a job there but I am from the west coast. I am moving up to Indiana, so I don't have any friends or family there to use their address. Is there a way I can still apply for aid?

What now?,"I am writing this because I don’t know what to do. I need advice. I need someone to talk to. I found this article: (if you have time read it)

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/domestic-violence-2701824-Apr2016/?amp=1

And I really feel like the author of this piece.  I relate so much and our situations are so similar. 

I’m with someone who is mad all the time, Pissed off all the time. When he gets mad at me he yells at me, tells me to shut the fuck up, shut my mouth, I’m a b****, a c***, a hoe, pretty much every bad name you can call someone. Tells
Me how I’ve let myself go and I’m just fat and lazy these days and not the girl he fell in love with. Accuses me of cheating on him. He gets so mad he gets in my face and puts a fist to my cheek and holds it there tightly and asks if I want to be punched in the mouth, or tells me if I don’t shut up he will punch he in the face. He shoves and restrains me sometimes. If I say we are over he grabs a gun and says he is going to go kill Himself And that no one cares if he dies. If I try to call The police he gets ENRAGED at me and says that I should not be involving the police, he will do whatever he can to get the phone from me. He is too strong and I do not stand a chance. 

Reading this I know it’s why not just leave him? Seems easy from the outside looking in. But I worry about him he really has some childhood trauma and some depression/ something undiagnosed that he won’t go get help for. He says he blacks out in rage and he is always saying he’s sorry for the things he does but then does them again. I really think he could have a better quality of life he went and got help. It makes me think maybe things can be fixed and the sweet warm funny person I knew before will come back. 

He just seems like he has lost his way. I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m tired of feeling like this. But I don’t want this to end in some huge battle royale. I just want him to be nice to me. 

What do I do now?",domesticviolence
He’s still mad 4 years later.,"My ex is really mad that “I won”. I divorced him after only 14 months. He was never able to get into my bank account. He never could separate me from my parents. He didn’t convince me to give away my baby like he wanted. He’s pissed. He didn’t win. He could never control me. 

We have that baby together and technically coparent (only he’s not involved, just to harass me). Now I “grey rock” him and don’t give him the time of day. But he continues to try and belittle me, and control me, via texting. I just ignore him. And I recently hired a lawyer to step in. This has made him so...so angry. 

The only reason he must be still bothering me 4 years later is because he’s still mad he couldn’t control me. This must haunt him. I’m not scared of him physically attacking me. He’s a pansy and my new husband would kick his ass. 

He’s just relentless over texting...but I’ve finally figured out he’s STILL mad that I never let him be in control.",domesticviolence
How to be strong in the face of current family abuse?,"Im abused. Ive been and am now. Im 16, the abusers are my parents and older brother. They haven’t been physical for years, but they are still emotionally abusive. I said it before on reddit, but Id rather not describe what exactly Im going through. All I can say is that Im not suicidal, they may injure me (but as long as Im obedient this should happen), Im not sexually abused by them. For tens of thousands of reasons I can’t contact CPS. Im from Poland, I know how the system works here, I called the crisis lines, I know for a fact that outside help is out of the equation. The same goes for any sort of therapy or mental health help.

Ive been going through this for so long, in less than 2 years Ill be free. But its difficult. Its difficult for me to function like this. I hate waking up in this house. I hate having to come down for breakfast. I hate acting this happy child role (they screamed at me for being too sad and started threatening me). I know it sounds easy, but its not. 

Im loosing my mind. Im getting more and more aggressive. Im scared of becoming like them. What can I do to ensure my sanity survives in these conditions?",domesticviolence
"My boyfriend, (24M), raises his hand at me, (21F), as a joke.","So this started not too long ago, where he would ""jokingly"" raise his hand at me. I flinch and he says ""did you think I was going to hit you? I would never hit you.""


He knows how I grew up how my relationship with my parents isn't the greatest and dispite me flinching every time, he still does it. As a joke of course. 


There was many things that have happened over the past year of us living together.. for example: he asks me to do his laundry for him... but if they aren't done immediately after he asks he gets annoyed and does it himself while bitching about me not doing it. I will be doing homework for my college course when he asks. Adding to this, one night I got really drunk and kissed a female friend of mine as someone else who is closer to my boyfriend suggested it and my boyfriend said ""I wish I let you die last night."". I told him when I found out it was a thing that had happened as I did not remember it.  When I brought it up again he said it was just a joke. He was upset and it was a bad joke. I did not and still do not believe him that it was just a joke... not with the way he was looking at me and how angry he was about it.


I recently moved out and back in with roommates, he knows I get anxious when it comes to the "" I need to talk to you"" stuff. But that's the message he sent for me to come back over. When I got there ""its nothing now that you are here."", ""I dont want to talk about it anymore."" And ""I'm giving you an out."" 


I am still working on moving things out of his place. The place where he lives alone in a 3 bedroom apartment as he didnt want to move... but he makes it seem like my fault that he does not have any money. All I do is apologize for leaving him like that... dispite him having the option to move as well.


I no longer know what I want to do... maybe I want to see if things get better while we live separately. Maybe I shouldn't though... 


TL;DR: my relationship has been rocky over the past year living together. I feel he does things just to get a reaction out of me sometimes. He always wants me to do things on his time even though I'm busy doing something else. I moved out to see if things will get better.. so far they have not.

I'm feeling so guilty for calling the police,"Hi everyone, I just signed up to reddit because I need encouragement and support.
I've been married for 13 years and we have been through a lot together. Lots of good stuff and we have a strong bond. I used to say I was addicted to him. He says me and our son is his family. But there has always been abuse, both verbal and physical in our marriage. First I blamed it on him being younger (10 years younger) , then because I have more sexual experience than him, me being swedish and him muslim and I gave up everything for him. Changed my behave and country. For years it was better, only every few months would he be abusive and maybe only a couple of times per year violent. We were made homeless in January and got a flat shortly after that and then all hell broke lose. 
A month ago I had him arrested and the day after I gave a lengthy statement to the police and he could possibly face a long time in jail.
Now I'm being accused of being the only woman in the world that tells the police everything from 13 years ago.
I agree , maybe that wasn't necessary but I defend myself by saying if you hadn't done anything, I wouldn't have anything to say.
We are talking serious assults with broken .... And bruises
And the name calling, I've been called everything you can imagine in several different languages. 
He is blaming everything but himself. He is begging me to help him get out of the hole I dug....

Help need opinions,"So I am a university student and currently since I was born, I've had an alcoholic father. Now why I am here is that lately, he's been way to violent with my mother, grandmother, and me. At this point, he is pulling the knife(multiple occasions) at me when he's done something violent and I have to use self-defense to get him to the ground. I've had to grab/push him away as he approaches my mom or grandmother like he's going to hit them multiple times. We've called the cops in the past when I was in elementary but it was never to this extent where a knife is being pulled out to stab me, more so its been him being drunk and breaking stuff when I was a kid. Now, why we haven't reported this is my parents/siblings are worried that if we call, he'd blame me for hitting him which provoked him, which will affect my file or something, which in the future prevents me from getting a government job here in Canada(as I'm aspiring to become the police and possibly move into cyber security)

I feel lost...,"This may be kinda long. I’m a 23 year old male. My mom and dad divorced when I was 2. My Dad cheated. They were both young and I believe that if they were a little older they would have worked it out. My mom married  another man when I was 7 and divorced him 5 years later, they fought constantly and the last straw was my mom hearing about him hitting on a girl at a bar. That summer she began dating my current step father. They have been married 10 years now. The first time he hit me, they had been together for maybe a year. There were quite a few times after that, maybe three or four a year for quite a while, every time he did it he was drunk. The last time he did it I was probably 19 and I broke his nose. Flash forward to today: my mom, stepdad, aunt, uncle, cousin and her husband went out on the lake and they were drinking all day. Some drama has been happening with my stepbrother and stepsister talking bad to my stepdad about my mom and blaming her for their problems; things that she has no control of. My mom helped them and has cared for them like they were her own kids the whole time. Well, some crap happened and they went to leave the island and the boat wouldn’t start. When my stepdad was trying to work on the motor he was so drunk he fell in the lake. He had already been swimming all day and was already wet so it shouldn’t have been a big deal. When he got back on the boat my mom jokingly said “want another beer clumsy?” Well he started the boat and drove off. My mom said that he was being hateful and they were arguing and when they got in the middle of the lake, he slammed her into the floor of the boat and proceeded to beat the shit out of her. The only reason he stopped was because some guys on another boat heard my mom screaming and went over there and got him off of her and brought my mom on their boat. My mom has swollen knots all over her head and scratches and bruises all over her arms and legs. He fled and nobody has seen him. For a while I was certain that I would kill him if I found him, but now I would just like to see his ass rot in jail. Problem is, he’ll likely stay for 2 hours and be out again. My mom is divorcing him now but I can’t help but feel lost. These past 10 years me and my mom have lived in hell, and for what??? I dealt with so much more than just him hitting me as a kid. His son is my age and he would constantly put me down, bully me, steal girls from me, and pick fights. I believed that it would get better but now... why in the hell did we even bother with them??? Knowing what I know now, what was the purpose? There are so many different things I could say but this is a long enough post. Idk why I typed this, just have to tell someone and get it off my chest I guess. Thanks for reading.",domesticviolence
Domestic Violence case thrown out,"I’ve been married to my husband for 7 years. He has gotten physical with me at least 5 times. He has seriously hurt me twice. This last time, he called the cops because the neighbors heard him hitting me. His plan was to tell the cops I was hitting him. It didn’t work out how he had hoped, and he was arrested. He had punched me in the face multiple times and body slammed me to the ground. I had a bruise on my cheek and forehead and a big mark on my back. 
I was glad to finally get justice that I had always been too scared to get for myself. Yesterday my husband got a letter in the mail telling him the DA was dropping the charges for lack of evidence. I think they really dropped it because of Covid. The courts are closed and the date was supposed to be rescheduled but it was thrown out instead.

Triggers.,"Here's a little something I wrote.

Disclaimer:

I am not justifying domestic violence, I am someone who has been on both the receiving and giving end of it. If you or anyone you know is going through abuse, call the police and seek help asap.

Triggers.

You knew exactly what to say and what to do to trigger me, my weaknesses, my doubts, my fears, my insecurities. I begged you to stop, yelled, screamed, in pain from the bullets you were shooting into my heart. Yet you’d keep going. Switching the lights on one by one until the entire room was filled with a bright brilliance, the color of red. Then, Boom, just like someone pulled the trigger of an execution shot, I’d retaliate. By this point conscious thought no longer existed, only the survival of my precious ego. To this day, I still don’t know why you didn’t stop. Maybe it was my weakness that triggered you, made you continue even though you knew that we were only going to hurt each other. I’m sorry that my actions caused you pain, but you kept pulling the trigger over and over, even when you knew that it would set a fire in my soul that would be impossible to extinguish. I know my triggers now, because of you, I’ve worked every single day to rehabilitate, to understand how to pull myself out of any situation before the alarm bells ring. The triggers that you pulled, those shots no longer hurt. What is dead may never die.",domesticviolence
Package delivery at my home for my ex,"This is kind of a dumb, minor thing, but I had a package arrive via UPS today for my ex. Its heavy and seems like it may be expensive. He moved out about a year ago, and though he claims he did all the necessary address change stuff, I have continued to get mail addressed to him. I’ve always returned it to sender but its been so draining having to continue seeing his name and take time to do this. Thankfully this seems to finally have tapered off quite a bit recently, though that may just be the pandemic.

I recently started therapy for the effects of his emotionally and sexually abusive behavior toward me during our relationship, and over the last month or so I've blocked him on all forms of contact I’ve been able to think of. I haven’t had any contact with him since earlier this year.

I have zero desire to make contact with him to get him this stupid package. I also resent the idea of simply taking it to the UPS store, as that feels like he gets to just continue controlling my behavior and making me cater to his whims, even though I ended things a year ago.

I’m not entirely sure what to do here. I think since the package came via UPS and was never in the possession of USPS, it wouldn’t considered obstructing mail to simply do nothing. But would that be stooping to his level? I don't want to be malicious; I simply do not want to let him take any more from me, even if its just half an hour of my time and energy.",domesticviolence
Abusive and arrested.. why do I feel so bad?,"My husband has been abusive for years, even stabbed me a few years ago and found himself in court.. obviously I relented, believed the lies he had changed, failed to attend the court case and accepted him back.

Someone rang the police, I didn’t press charges but, I didn’t need to. My neighbour reported the ongoing abuse.. even giving times and dates. 
For weeks now, with him gone I have felt free. Even cleared the house of his belongings. The police have deemed me high risk, changed my locks/ put devices on my door to prevent him forcing entry.

"Was this abuse, or just a family joke","I feel like I was abused but I'm not sure if it was abuse or just something different.

I used to live in a house with the abusive stepfather, and abusive brother, AB is something like 24 and ASF is like 36. On numerous occasions AB has hit me, and choked me until I passed out and at one point he even tried to stab me, he missed his shot what was going towards my stomach but it slit my wrist and I still have that scar to this day, AB abuse was much more private and it only stayed inside of the house, however ASF was not bothered about abusing me in public. One time me and ASF were crossing this field where he choked me until I passed out and left me there stranded, in the middle of nowhere. Another time we were out shopping and ASF bought three bottles of washing up liquid and he forced me to drink one of them, like he shoved the cap inside of my mouth and would just keep squirting it inside of my mouth and if I spat it out he would punch me in the stomach, so I had no other choice but to swallow the washing up liquid.

Those were just a few times about my story and I just don't know whether it was abuse or just some sort of family joke thing.

Scared and alone,"I have never posted before and never thought this would be the reason for my first post. Backstory is...my husband and I only got married 5 months ago (but together for 8 years). I can say there has been emotional abuse along the way. He is the king of the silent treatment (weeks). 

I have a quick temper that I work on but sometimes I regress. One such time was 3 weeks ago. Husband carries a lot of anger because he hated his job. He likes to take it out on me by nitpicking. On this occasion I snapped a little, grabbed his arm and angrily told him to give it a rest. 
Totally immediately apologized for grabbing him and meant it. Mind you nothing close to this has happened before, my temper is quick, verbal, and fleeting. He said never do it again, said I won't and again, so so sorry. 

He retreats to basement and since we have different schedules, it is easy to avoid each other. I genuinely feel bad, I write him notes, bake him lots of things, send him emails. Nothing. 

Now to last night. I'm dead asleep in bed, after 3 weeks of silence (but I'm still cooking for him, packing his lunches, etc) he charges in screams a bunch of stuff, one being I want a divorce. Slams door. Not a minute later, comes back, spits in my face and again says he wants a divorce. Minutes later comes back once more, chokes me, hits me in the face, and then punches and breaks my mirror. 

Now I know I started this, but I don't understand what makes someone that took 3 weeks to think about it go into a sudden rampage. Aside from the occasional play fight where he got a little overzealous he has never hit me before. He could have asked for a divorce without all of this. 

I left and stayed with someone because I was scared. But I know we have to talk even if it is just talking terms of getting out of this marriage. So I'm back home now and he will be home in about 2 hours. I'm waiting up so we can talk when he gets home. But I'm terrified right now. I can't just move out, I work from home. And everything is combined so there will have to be a lot of talking at some point.

Can I report physical abuse by my father that happened in 1993?,"My parents were abusive for my entire childhood.

I remember crying and going to my room, feeling absolutely devastated. I didn't even know that this was abuse, or that anyone could help me.

Now, 27 years later, my perspective is different. Is it still possible to file a police report? I don't have any evidence of course, it's not like there were video cameras rolling at our house back then. Of course my father would 100% deny it happened. When I told relatives about these events much later, my father called me a liar, and said I was just trying to make him look bad in front of the relatives.

"Any way to get my mom, sister and I away from my father?

Today he threw a plate of food at me and threw hot water at me and my younger sister. my younger sister was hurt a bit by the water. He also tried to hit me, then hit my mom for defending me. He yelled at me and called me profanities in Korean (equivalents of bitch and retard). This happens quite frequently. i only have 2 voice recordings of my father yelling at my mother, one from 2018 and one from today. unfortunately it’s in korean so whoever tried to hear it needs a translator. he is defending his actions of abuse so you can hear a bit of description about what he has done.

Domestic Violence AGAINST Men,"\*Disclosure: I am in no way intending to diminish the difficulties faced by female or child victims of domestic violence, the severity is there and cases are much more prevalent than men\*

I'm currently writing a grade 12 persuasive speech highlighting the issue surrounding male domestic violence.

What I'm trying to get across is that due to men making up a majority of perpetrators, male victims don't get the required support. Due to cultural assumptions, we generally see men as the abusers and women/children as the victims. Stereotypes don't appear to help this, with a lot of men feeling ashamed about sharing their story, as they worry people might perceive them as weak or as not 'masculine'. This is actually a serious issue, as male suicide rates are pretty high, especially around the ages of 30-50, so abuse from a partner or other family member could be a contributing factor.

I know this is a touchy subject, but I would really appreciate some help or maybe some sources that would give me some information on domestic violence against males.",domesticviolence

"Psycho ex-boyfriend giving endless abuse, both physical and mental","Hi,

Writing this on behalf of my friend. She's been dealing with a crazy ex-boyfriend who's been physically and mentally abusing her for a long time now. She has a lot of struggles with self-harm and keeping herself happy, she doesn't have many friends and I'm the one who's has given her the support to leave this relationship she's been suffering in for so long. 

I continue to do this, however this dude is the definition of scum. He hacked her Discord and has made her paranoid online. She's made a new one, he found it. He even found out some of my personal information and has been emailing me the same nonsense threats as her. Things such as he's going to ""pay her back"", ""hurt her"", telling her she's better off dead. And that he won't stop until she's dead he said.

This is all fine and easy to ignore online, as he lives in another continent to her. However he has emailed me detailing he plans to fly over and to see her and ""give some pay back"". He's spamming my email, since I informed my friend of how to block him everywhere. So she doesn't know he plans to do this yet.

She lives with her family, but her family also mentally and physically abuses her. For instance, no matter how much she tells her mother they're broken up and etc. She still doesn't believe her and continues to ""support"" the relationship. He plans to contact the mother to have her bring him over. I have little doubt she'd actually do this and she's aware of the abuse in the relationship, as my friend has told her several times. 

My friend has no job, a very little amount of money (around $600), I'm the only positive support in her life it seems. She needs to escape from both her family and this man who wants her dead. In this situation, what can she do? She lives in California, the dude in Sweden. The girl is over 18.

Advice on finding a therapist [UK],"Hi, not sure if this is the right place to post this but I’m not sure where to find advice. 

I’m coming to the realisation that my marriage of 10 years is not just dysfunctional, but abusive. I don’t really have anyone to talk to about it or to work through things with. 

I have had two therapists in the past year, the first didn’t really gel with me and just kept telling me I should leave my husband if I didn’t like his behaviour, as if it was an easy thing to do after 10 years. The second has repeatedly warned me not to throw away my relationship and to work more on my marriage. 

We did couples therapy briefly and I found that we usually ended up talking about my behaviour rather than his. I was thinking about getting us back into it but from what I’ve read that’s not a good idea. 

How do I find a therapist who understands and who will help me work through the muddle in my head? I’ve tried searching therapist directories but I get loads of results if I filter for “abuse” and I can’t possibly call them all to see what their attitude to abuse is.

Has anyone gotten past violence?,"Hi,

I (f 25) find myself in a relationship with a man (m 25) who is generally kind, loving and fiercely loyal. For the most part we have a good relationship and have a lot of fun together, and we started up a share house together which has been a joy. We just celebrated our 2yr anniversary. At the beginning of the relationship we both showed abusive tendancies (me, control and jealousy. Him, violence) we both went to therapy and worked on ourselves, which went well! We didn't have any incidence of violence in three months. However we had an incident the other day.

We had just finished watching a movie together and he went and turned the light on. I said it hurt my eyes and went and turned it off. He then said he needed it on and turned it on again and I then turned it off. He then turned it on and restrained my hands. I asked him to let go, then I yelled for him to let go, then I went to kick him to let me go. He then hit me hard on the back. 

A good compromise would have been for us to turn the lamp on but at the time neither of us could communicate that. I'm scared now that this violence happened that we're not as recovered as I thought. Has anyone here been able to get past violence in a relationship or have any advice on whether an unhealthy relationship can become healthy? 

TL,DR: my boyfriend hit me after a period of non violence. Has anyone moved past violence into a healthy relationship?",domesticviolence
Preparing to start over after leaving my emotionally abusive relationship,"I am preparing to move out of my ex's house this week, we had been together for almost three years, in which he was EXTREMELY emotionally abusive.

I booked myself an air bnb for a month to give myself time and space to plan out where I am going to go from here. I want to apply for low income housing, food stamps etc but I wouldn't have an address and I don't know anyone in the area that I am moving to. I had moved to Alabama with my ex since he got a job there but I am from the west coast. I am moving up to Indiana, so I don't have any friends or family there to use their address.

What now?,"I am writing this because I don’t know what to do. I need advice. I need someone to talk to. I found this article: (if you have time read it)

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/domestic-violence-2701824-Apr2016/?amp=1

And I really feel like the author of this piece.  I relate so much and our situations are so similar. 

I’m with someone who is mad all the time, Pissed off all the time. When he gets mad at me he yells at me, tells me to shut the fuck up, shut my mouth, I’m a b****, a c***, a hoe, pretty much every bad name you can call someone. Tells
Me how I’ve let myself go and I’m just fat and lazy these days and not the girl he fell in love with. Accuses me of cheating on him. He gets so mad he gets in my face and puts a fist to my cheek and holds it there tightly and asks if I want to be punched in the mouth, or tells me if I don’t shut up he will punch he in the face. He shoves and restrains me sometimes. If I say we are over he grabs a gun and says he is going to go kill Himself And that no one cares if he dies. If I try to call The police he gets ENRAGED at me and says that I should not be involving the police, he will do whatever he can to get the phone from me. He is too strong and I do not stand a chance. 

Reading this I know it’s why not just leave him? Seems easy from the outside looking in. But I worry about him he really has some childhood trauma and some depression/ something undiagnosed that he won’t go get help for. He says he blacks out in rage and he is always saying he’s sorry for the things he does but then does them again. I really think he could have a better quality of life he went and got help. It makes me think maybe things can be fixed and the sweet warm funny person I knew before will come back. 

He just seems like he has lost his way. I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m tired of feeling like this. But I don’t want this to end in some huge battle royale. I just want him to be nice to me. 

What do I do now?",domesticviolence
He’s still mad 4 years later.,"My ex is really mad that “I won”. I divorced him after only 14 months. He was never able to get into my bank account. He never could separate me from my parents. He didn’t convince me to give away my baby like he wanted. He’s pissed. He didn’t win. He could never control me. 

We have that baby together and technically coparent (only he’s not involved, just to harass me). Now I “grey rock” him and don’t give him the time of day. But he continues to try and belittle me, and control me, via texting. I just ignore him. And I recently hired a lawyer to step in. This has made him so...so angry. 

The only reason he must be still bothering me 4 years later is because he’s still mad he couldn’t control me. This must haunt him. I’m not scared of him physically attacking me. He’s a pansy and my new husband would kick his ass. 

He’s just relentless over texting...but I’ve finally figured out he’s STILL mad that I never let him be in control.",domesticviolence
How to be strong in the face of current family abuse?,"Im abused. Ive been and am now. Im 16, the abusers are my parents and older brother. They haven’t been physical for years, but they are still emotionally abusive. I said it before on reddit, but Id rather not describe what exactly Im going through. All I can say is that Im not suicidal, they may injure me (but as long as Im obedient this should happen), Im not sexually abused by them. For tens of thousands of reasons I can’t contact CPS. Im from Poland, I know how the system works here, I called the crisis lines, I know for a fact that outside help is out of the equation. The same goes for any sort of therapy or mental health help.

Ive been going through this for so long, in less than 2 years Ill be free. But its difficult. Its difficult for me to function like this. I hate waking up in this house. I hate having to come down for breakfast. I hate acting this happy child role (they screamed at me for being too sad and started threatening me). I know it sounds easy, but its not.

"My boyfriend, (24M), raises his hand at me, (21F), as a joke.","So this started not too long ago, where he would ""jokingly"" raise his hand at me. I flinch and he says ""did you think I was going to hit you? I would never hit you.""


He knows how I grew up how my relationship with my parents isn't the greatest and dispite me flinching every time, he still does it. As a joke of course. 


There was many things that have happened over the past year of us living together.. for example: he asks me to do his laundry for him... but if they aren't done immediately after he asks he gets annoyed and does it himself while bitching about me not doing it. I will be doing homework for my college course when he asks. Adding to this, one night I got really drunk and kissed a female friend of mine as someone else who is closer to my boyfriend suggested it and my boyfriend said ""I wish I let you die last night."". I told him when I found out it was a thing that had happened as I did not remember it.  When I brought it up again he said it was just a joke. He was upset and it was a bad joke. I did not and still do not believe him that it was just a joke... not with the way he was looking at me and how angry he was about it.


I recently moved out and back in with roommates, he knows I get anxious when it comes to the "" I need to talk to you"" stuff. But that's the message he sent for me to come back over. When I got there ""its nothing now that you are here."", ""I dont want to talk about it anymore."" And ""I'm giving you an out."" 


I am still working on moving things out of his place. The place where he lives alone in a 3 bedroom apartment as he didnt want to move... but he makes it seem like my fault that he does not have any money. All I do is apologize for leaving him like that... dispite him having the option to move as well.


I no longer know what I want to do... maybe I want to see if things get better while we live separately. Maybe I shouldn't though... 


TL;DR: my relationship has been rocky over the past year living together. I feel he does things just to get a reaction out of me sometimes. He always wants me to do things on his time even though I'm busy doing something else. I moved out to see if things will get better.. so far they have not.

I'm feeling so guilty for calling the police,"Hi everyone, I just signed up to reddit because I need encouragement and support.
I've been married for 13 years and we have been through a lot together. Lots of good stuff and we have a strong bond. I used to say I was addicted to him. He says me and our son is his family. But there has always been abuse, both verbal and physical in our marriage. First I blamed it on him being younger (10 years younger) , then because I have more sexual experience than him, me being swedish and him muslim and I gave up everything for him. Changed my behave and country. For years it was better, only every few months would he be abusive and maybe only a couple of times per year violent. We were made homeless in January and got a flat shortly after that and then all hell broke lose. 
A month ago I had him arrested and the day after I gave a lengthy statement to the police and he could possibly face a long time in jail.
Now I'm being accused of being the only woman in the world that tells the police everything from 13 years ago.
I agree , maybe that wasn't necessary but I defend myself by saying if you hadn't done anything, I wouldn't have anything to say.

Help need opinions,"So I am a university student and currently since I was born, I've had an alcoholic father. Now why I am here is that lately, he's been way to violent with my mother, grandmother, and me. At this point, he is pulling the knife(multiple occasions) at me when he's done something violent and I have to use self-defense to get him to the ground. I've had to grab/push him away as he approaches my mom or grandmother like he's going to hit them multiple times. We've called the cops in the past when I was in elementary but it was never to this extent where a knife is being pulled out to stab me, more so its been him being drunk and breaking stuff when I was a kid. Now, why we haven't reported this is my parents/siblings are worried that if we call, he'd blame me for hitting him which provoked him, which will affect my file or something, which in the future prevents me from getting a government job here in Canada(as I'm aspiring to become the police and possibly move into cyber security)

I feel lost...,"This may be kinda long. I’m a 23 year old male. My mom and dad divorced when I was 2. My Dad cheated. They were both young and I believe that if they were a little older they would have worked it out. My mom married  another man when I was 7 and divorced him 5 years later, they fought constantly and the last straw was my mom hearing about him hitting on a girl at a bar. That summer she began dating my current step father. They have been married 10 years now. The first time he hit me, they had been together for maybe a year. There were quite a few times after that, maybe three or four a year for quite a while, every time he did it he was drunk. The last time he did it I was probably 19 and I broke his nose. Flash forward to today: my mom, stepdad, aunt, uncle, cousin and her husband went out on the lake and they were drinking all day. Some drama has been happening with my stepbrother and stepsister talking bad to my stepdad about my mom and blaming her for their problems; things that she has no control of. My mom helped them and has cared for them like they were her own kids the whole time. Well, some crap happened and they went to leave the island and the boat wouldn’t start. When my stepdad was trying to work on the motor he was so drunk he fell in the lake. He had already been swimming all day and was already wet so it shouldn’t have been a big deal. When he got back on the boat my mom jokingly said “want another beer clumsy?” Well he started the boat and drove off. My mom said that he was being hateful and they were arguing and when they got in the middle of the lake, he slammed her into the floor of the boat and proceeded to beat the shit out of her. The only reason he stopped was because some guys on another boat heard my mom screaming and went over there and got him off of her and brought my mom on their boat. My mom has swollen knots all over her head and scratches and bruises all over her arms and legs. He fled and nobody has seen him. For a while I was certain that I would kill him if I found him, but now I would just like to see his ass rot in jail. Problem is, he’ll likely stay for 2 hours and be out again. My mom is divorcing him now but I can’t help but feel lost. These past 10 years me and my mom have lived in hell, and for what??? I dealt with so much more than just him hitting me as a kid. His son is my age and he would constantly put me down, bully me, steal girls from me, and pick fights. I believed that it would get better but now... why in the hell did we even bother with them??? Knowing what I know now, what was the purpose? There are so many different things I could say but this is a long enough post.

Domestic Violence case thrown out,"I’ve been married to my husband for 7 years. He has gotten physical with me at least 5 times. He has seriously hurt me twice.

My story with an abusive stepfather figure.,"So let's start off with a little backstory.
I was born in October, 2004. I was living with my mother and father, until eight months later they split up because my mum said that I was a mistake and that she no longer wanted me, which caused my dad to move out and find someone new to raise me with (to be my next step mum or something like that). Me and my dad moved in with a single mother of two boys, and this was before I even had my first birthday. My dad and soon to be step mum lived together for 8 years and in that timeframe my little brother was born.

The day came, the day where my dad would walk in on my stepmother and my soon to be abusive sort of stepfather having sex. Things did not turn out well, my dad and stepmum got into an extreme argument, and they started to fight, me and my little brother were inside of the living room where we could hear the while thing unfold. My Abusive stepfather thing was upstairs calling the police to get my dad out of the house. 30 minutes later the police came to drag my dad outside, and while I saw what was happening i kept telling my dad to let me go and live with him, because i loved my dad and he meant the world to me. He was then arrested for two days and then let go when they found out that he was innocent and no one got hurt. A few days after he got out of prison my dad called my stepmother so that he could talk to me. The conversation went something like this (D= Dad. Me= Me)

D:  Hi, son I want to let you know that I'm ok and that I am out of prison now so if you want to talk, I'm here for you.
Me: Ok dad, can I come live with you though.
D: Buddy listen, you cant come and live with me now because I have to work all day and you're only 8, which means that you cant look after yourself.
Me: Yea I can, I'm a big boy.
D: i know you are buddy, but no means no. I am so sorry son, go put me on the phone with mummy and remember I love you very very much.

Little did I know that giving that phone to my stepmother would set off this bomb that was my abusive step father.

After I gave my phone and went downstairs to play with my legos. My ASF (abusive step father) came in to the room I was in and punched me in the back of the head. (He has no problems with alcoholism or a mental health disorder) and he said to me ""Dont you ever talk to that disgusting wife beater again, DO YOU HEAR ME."" 
Me: [crying] ""y-yes""
ASF: ""If I ever hear you speaking to him again I will hit you ten times harder""
Me: ""N-no please dont""

[I am already starting to tear up, and I am just going to tell you all of the significant times and the times that I am constantly being haunted by, because of PTSD]

Time #1: Me and ASF were walking into town to get some groceries, but to get to the town we have to cross this field of grass which is about a mile long. Me and ASF were having a chat (I was 8/9 at the time and I didnt know what he was like). I must have said something that offended him because he started to strangle me and did not let go until I almost passed out.

Time #2: for a few weeks now, I had been going over to my dads every weekend because he was free on the weekends and we both wanted to see eachother. One week though my dad had bought me a new book about trains and when I bought that book home ASF took one look and the cover, saw that it said dad on the cover and then started to hit me with the book. (I was about 10 at the time).

Time #3: ASF had been abusing me on numerous occasions and when my dad saw the bruises on my arms, he asked me about them and I told him about ASF He took me down to the police station to tell my story, the police say the will look into it, but later my dad got a text saying that they can't look into the case because I was only a kid and that I was just making stuff up. This had a huge impact on me and now I have trust issues 

Time #4: ASF had hit me so many times that I was so scared of him, and I was excited to go into school because that was my only getaway during the weekdays. I have tried telling my stepmother and school about it but they all just said the same thing ""that I am just a kid, and I am making stuff up"". I went home extremely upset because no one seemed to believe my story, even when I had the marks to justify my points. At this time I went into the kitchen and saw a huge kitchen knife on the table, just left there and so I grabbed it by the handle and pointed it at my throat. My stepmother was just walking into the kitchen when she saw me with the knife, bawling my eyes out. She rushed over to me grabbed the knife out of my hands and said ""dont be so stupid, nothing has happened to you to make you want to kill yourself.""

Time #5: ASF asked me to do something for him, so I tried standing up to myself and said ""no, do it yourself"".
As soon as I hear him shout ""WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY TO ME"" whilst just walking into my room, I immediately regretted it. He grabbed me, put me into the firemans carry position and walked me into the kitchen and shoved a bottle of washing up liquid into my mouth, he just kept holding it down causing it to empty into my mouth, leaving me with a mouthful of washing up liquid, which he then forced me to swallow it and then he did the same thing, filled my mouth and made me swallow it. Three times he did that three times.

Time #6: I was at school, we were in a PE lesson when I accidentally pushed a girl over and she grazed her leg. School called my house phone where of course ASF had to answer it. I walked home and as soon as I opened the door ASF snatched me slammed the door closed, grabbed me by the throat so I couldn't breathe raised me up to the ceiling and then dropped me. I hit my head on the floor causing me to bleed and he left me there. I still have the scar from where I fell and hit the floor.

Time #7: I was doing my homework when my pen exploded. I asked ASF if I could have a spare but then he got pissed because I apparently did something to make the pen explode, when I told him that i didn't do anything to the pen he got pissed and threatened to kill me by ""throwing me outside the top floor window and stomping on my head"" at that time my dad had met a new girlfriend and had a place with two bedrooms so I immediately ran outside with my phone and called up my dad and I said that i will be there soon. I ran all night, I ran all the way to my dads house which was like 5 miles away and then my dads girlfriend made me move in with them. I will be forever thankful to her because it felt like all of the pain had just stopped. But then a couple of months later I got sent to the doctors where I got diagnosed with Depression, PTSD, anxiety and bipolar disorder. 

That is all I can write down because there are some stuff that I cant say because I will immediately burst out crying, like the time ASF got my pet dog to rape me. (I know that It sounds weird and like a lie but it isnt. I was there pinned down while he watched, laughing while I was left feeling hopeless).

I am sorry if my stories are a bit scuffed at some points I have been crying the entire time I have been writing this and I cant think straight.",domesticviolence
Help!! My verbally and emotionally abusive stepmom may come back. What should I do. I’m 14,"Help!! My abusive stepmom may come back

Ok so I’m 14 years old (male) and I’ve had an abusive stepmom for about 8 years and I’ve hated every second of it. But 2 days ago she beat my dad up while I was sleeping. She just gave him a black eye but it looks pretty bad. Anyway she got kicked out and now she’s saying she so sorry and my dads thinking about putting her in rehab to get help and a for her to come back. She’s and alcoholic, bi polar, and just straight up crazy. He told me this right after I got done celebrating that she is going to be gone. Now I’m having crazy thoughts if she comes back like me wanting to kill her, beat the shit outta her, etc. I don’t know what I should do for that and what I should do to not live with her if she does come back. PS she’s been verbally and emotionally abusive to me. A sometimes physically. So I have reasons to be thinking these thoughts. I’m not just crazy",domesticviolence
Abuse,"        No one cares enough to talk about it with me. I know this is pathetic but I went to tell someone about it...they just blocked me. I guess my boyfriend..abuser..was right about no one caring. And no..this isnt for attention. I'm suffering. I'm a teenager..idk how this can be happening to me. I feel like this is just the end of my life. Ans no, I am not going to commit suicide
 No, he cannot hurt me physically now because we are long distance these months. He never hit me or something...but he made me do stuff..... dont know how to get away. Guys...some of the stuff he made me do to myself...it was just...I have no words. 
        2 years ago, I let a guy take advantage of me sexually. I was scared and felt trapped. I didnt know how to stop it. Actually..it would have been easy for me to stop it.  But I felt soo trapped. I was scared and shaking and it happened more than once. And he found out. Well...I told him about it...I told him about it...hmm.. 17 months ago. And since then, he has blamed me for it..he has insulted me horrible..mocked me about it..says he will never forgive me..wont forget what i did. He has talked about it with me for countless hours. If i get mad at him..he says..oh so you can get mad at me but you let him get everything he wanted?(trigger warning coming up..sexual) Oh you wont let me do sexual things with u now but you let him get your body? He calls me used and worthless. He calls me stupid bitch. Today he even did. Yesterday he forced me to put a toothbrush up my ass on a video call. Whyd i do it you ask?? Even tho it's horrible? Because he threatened to leave me and block me if I didnt. And he has ruined me so bad that I now think I need him and love him and want him even when he is doing this to me. He convinced me that no one will ever love me. I'm just weak. Weak. I let guys do that to me. I'm weak. There have been hours and hours of sexual abuse. Why do I endure that? I just have no self esteem or self worth anymore. It's gone. I believe I'm worthless and trash and deserve it for being a slut in my past. I'm sure people will judge me even more now...idk.

Need Help,"I have been working with my local DV organization since the beginning of April. I fled my home March 18th to get away from an increasingly tense situation in which I felt unsafe. I won't go into details at this time but note there is destruction of property, financial abuse, verbal abuse, and public humiliation.  Today, at the advice of my counselor to be sure I am covering my bases, I let him know I will be getting my belongings from the home with the help of others, including my cats. I suggested he go to breakfast with his family so that they're not disturbed and I would leave the key there when I leave. 

He sent back an ugly text saying that I would not be allowed into the home that I am still on the lease for, that I would be taken to court for ""committing libel and slander"", and that I would not be allowed to have my pets because I ""abandoned"" them when I fled. 

The kicker is the exact phrasing is what I used to tell our landlords what happened. Either he managed to look at my emails to them, or more than likely, they disclosed what is said to him since I have been fighting them (along with my advocates) to be released from the lease. So now I'm having a full blown panic attack but I calmly send back that they're my cats and he will not keep all three pets (we had two cats and a dog, and he decided to keep the dog). I also stated I will get a police escort if need be.

Since he works for the jail, he thinks he is above the law and the only authority on legal matters. He then told me the police will not help because it is a civil matter. 

I did not respond to him beyond that and instead called the crisis line for my DV organization. I got hold of someone who helped me and who told me to leave a message for my advocate. I did, stating what I knew at that time. Now I see he also changed the password to my account somehow for the rent which has access to my direct checking account. 

I am afraid something will happen to my cats because his sister (who is there not on the lease) has a history of animal abuse. What can I do? I'm afraid the police won't help me.",domesticviolence
Ways to help neighbors’ suspected domestic violence situation,"Hi, I apologize if this isn’t the place to post this, but I didn’t get much response from asking r/advice, and I figure this is the best place to ask

For several months I’ve heard a male voice coming from my neighbor’s apartment absolutely screaming his head off. Extremely profane. Says “my wife” as he’s yelling a lot so I assume it’s a husband-wife living there. I’ve called the cops whenever he has said anything that sounded like it would lead to self-harm or if I ever heard the woman scream, but they never follow up with me after and it doesn’t seem to help. I finally got apartment management involved but their only solution is to terminate their lease if they continue causing disturbances. 

I don’t feel comfortable getting directly involved since I’m a small woman. And while I’ve never personally met the neighbors, the man came to our door and intimidated my roommate one of the times we called the cops. He also beats directly on his ceiling (literally shaking our floors) and screams at us if we are “walking too loud”, but we are very quiet people, and he does it even when we’re sitting quietly eating/working, so I suspect he hears things. So he has been extremely hostile to us and I’m concerned for the safety of the woman in his apartment.

I also don’t know the whole situation, sometimes he screams about her abusing him. But the screaming happens at all hours of the day and night and I’ve lost a ton of sleep to it and need it to stop. I feel scared to walk around my own apartment or walk by their floor. I don’t want the apartment management to force them out if that means putting a victim on the street, but I don’t know what else to do besides continuing to call the police/notify management as it happens. Does anyone here have any suggestions?",domesticviolence
Online support groups?,"Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I was wondering if there were any online support groups for DV victims. I was a victim of DV about three years ago by an abusive ex-boyfriend. I am now with someone else (we have been together almost two years), but the pain still comes from what happened to me, and it is very much negatively impacting my relationship. I want to be able to move on from the pain and psychological scars that my abuser left me and take back control of my thoughts and emotions. I have learned that those who have been abused can become abusers themselves. I am worried that I am becoming emotionally manipulative because of what happened to me. It's a lot, I'd just like to talk to others about it who have been in similar situations and find a group that I can look forward going to. Thank you.",domesticviolence

Covid and the courts,"My partner and I were assaulted by an alcoholic family member a little bit before the lockdown happened. The police arrested him that night, we have a no contact order that has thankfully been extended through everything. The courts have been closed and everything has been on hold. He was charged with 3 misdemeanors, and even though it was violent, because it didn't reach felony level, they are telling us that jail time is unlikely in part due to Covid, even though he was on probation and violated that probation both by drinking and the criminal charges. We also have second hand knowledge of other crimes and probation violations we brought to the attention of the police, but if direct witnesses do not give a report, it will not matter. The police did a tox screen on him that night and found that he was heavily intoxicated. The courts aren't really responding to probation violations due to the virus. 

I am so tired, so frustrated, I fear there will be no consequences for his actions. We have had such a difficult time through all of this. There isn't any recourse because the virus is outside everyone's control. Covid has taken many things, and one of those things is justice.",domesticviolence
Can I report physical abuse by my father that happened in 1993?,"My parents were abusive for my entire childhood. One event that stands out in my memory is when my father punched me in the face so hard that my nose started bleeding profusely. At the time, I thought this was just normal parenting and I deserved it. The reason was that I wanted to watch TV but he didn't want me to. I remember crying and going to my room, feeling absolutely devastated. I didn't even know that this was abuse, or that anyone could help me.

Now, 27 years later, my perspective is different. Is it still possible to file a police report? I don't have any evidence of course, it's not like there were video cameras rolling at our house back then. Of course my father would 100% deny it happened. When I told relatives about these events much later, my father called me a liar, and said I was just trying to make him look bad in front of the relatives.

But just for completeness, and for recording that this event happened, can I call the police? Would they interview him? Since state laws might apply, this happened in Minnesota.",domesticviolence

Domestic Violence AGAINST Men,"\*Disclosure: I am in no way intending to diminish the difficulties faced by female or child victims of domestic violence, the severity is there and cases are much more prevalent than men\*

I'm currently writing a grade 12 persuasive speech highlighting the issue surrounding male domestic violence.

What I'm trying to get across is that due to men making up a majority of perpetrators, male victims don't get the required support. Due to cultural assumptions, we generally see men as the abusers and women/children as the victims. Stereotypes don't appear to help this, with a lot of men feeling ashamed about sharing their story, as they worry people might perceive them as weak or as not 'masculine'. This is actually a serious issue, as male suicide rates are pretty high, especially around the ages of 30-50, so abuse from a partner or other family member could be a contributing factor.

I know this is a touchy subject, but I would really appreciate some help or maybe some sources that would give me some information on domestic violence against males.",domesticviolence

"Psycho ex-boyfriend giving endless abuse, both physical and mental","Hi,

Writing this on behalf of my friend. She's been dealing with a crazy ex-boyfriend who's been physically and mentally abusing her for a long time now. She has a lot of struggles with self-harm and keeping herself happy, she doesn't have many friends and I'm the one who's has given her the support to leave this relationship she's been suffering in for so long. 

I continue to do this, however this dude is the definition of scum. He hacked her Discord and has made her paranoid online. She's made a new one, he found it. He even found out some of my personal information and has been emailing me the same nonsense threats as her. Things such as he's going to ""pay her back"", ""hurt her"", telling her she's better off dead. And that he won't stop until she's dead he said.

This is all fine and easy to ignore online, as he lives in another continent to her. However he has emailed me detailing he plans to fly over and to see her and ""give some pay back"". He's spamming my email, since I informed my friend of how to block him everywhere. So she doesn't know he plans to do this yet.

She lives with her family, but her family also mentally and physically abuses her. For instance, no matter how much she tells her mother they're broken up and etc. She still doesn't believe her and continues to ""support"" the relationship. He plans to contact the mother to have her bring him over. I have little doubt she'd actually do this and she's aware of the abuse in the relationship, as my friend has told her several times. 

My friend has no job, a very little amount of money (around $600), I'm the only positive support in her life it seems. She needs to escape from both her family and this man who wants her dead. In this situation, what can she do? She lives in California, the dude in Sweden. The girl is over 18.

Advice on finding a therapist [UK],"Hi, not sure if this is the right place to post this but I’m not sure where to find advice. 

I’m coming to the realisation that my marriage of 10 years is not just dysfunctional, but abusive. I don’t really have anyone to talk to about it or to work through things with. 

I have had two therapists in the past year, the first didn’t really gel with me and just kept telling me I should leave my husband if I didn’t like his behaviour, as if it was an easy thing to do after 10 years. The second has repeatedly warned me not to throw away my relationship and to work more on my marriage. 

We did couples therapy briefly and I found that we usually ended up talking about my behaviour rather than his. I was thinking about getting us back into it but from what I’ve read that’s not a good idea. 

How do I find a therapist who understands and who will help me work through the muddle in my head? I’ve tried searching therapist directories but I get loads of results if I filter for “abuse” and I can’t possibly call them all to see what their attitude to abuse is.

Has anyone gotten past violence?,"Hi,

I (f 25) find myself in a relationship with a man (m 25) who is generally kind, loving and fiercely loyal. For the most part we have a good relationship and have a lot of fun together, and we started up a share house together which has been a joy. We just celebrated our 2yr anniversary. At the beginning of the relationship we both showed abusive tendancies (me, control and jealousy. Him, violence) we both went to therapy and worked on ourselves, which went well! We didn't have any incidence of violence in three months. However we had an incident the other day.

We had just finished watching a movie together and he went and turned the light on. I said it hurt my eyes and went and turned it off. He then said he needed it on and turned it on again and I then turned it off. He then turned it on and restrained my hands. I asked him to let go, then I yelled for him to let go, then I went to kick him to let me go. He then hit me hard on the back. 

A good compromise would have been for us to turn the lamp on but at the time neither of us could communicate that. I'm scared now that this violence happened that we're not as recovered as I thought. Has anyone here been able to get past violence in a relationship or have any advice on whether an unhealthy relationship can become healthy?

I sprayed his face with window cleaner,"Today my husband started arguing with me over something very stupid (very meaningless matter) and wouldn’t stop despite the fact that I asked him to. 

My husband hasn’t beat me in about two months. While I’m not delusional and I know he will do it again, I didn’t think he would get abusive over something so small and meaningless on a good day. 

As soon as the argument started I felt scared. All I could think was if he started an argument while we were having such a good day, then he was out for blood. 

Because of the argument, he started following me in every room. I was walking around because I was cleaning. I asked him to leave me alone but he didn’t. 

Our laundry room is tiny and he followed me in there too. I was wiping the top of the washer and dryer with Windex. He kept yelling at me and coming onto me. I told him to back off but he didn’t. He didn’t even care when I told him he was scaring me.

I had a bottle of raspberry vinegar Windex in my hand and I was done wiping the washer. He was still yelling at me. I told him again he was scaring me but he continued being an asshole. I couldn’t get him off my back. 
He kept yelling at me. So I sprayed his face with the Windex I was holding. 

That stopped him in his tracks, obviously, and for a second he looked at me with a shit ton of anger. I thought “that’s it, I’m getting my ass kicked” and he would have done it, but instead he closed his eyes and put his hands to his face and let a high-pitched scream out. Then he got out of the room and ran to the bathroom screaming in the same way. 
I looked down at the Windex bottle and it said “non-toxic!” on it. I thought he’ll be fine. And he was fine, but he did a whole scene where he was crying in the shower while rinsing his eyes, and then he went to bed despite the fact that it was like 7:00pm.",domesticviolence

Child Custody - Pending Domestic Violence Case," I am in Texas. My ex (never married) and father of my 1 &amp; 2 year old daughters was arrested in March for Assault Family Violence - Choking/Impeding breath after suffocating me with his hands during an argument. We were laying in bed and after some insults back and forth he rolls over on top me (I was laying sideways - facing away from him) and screams ""BBBIIITTTCCCHHHH!!!"" as loud as he possibly could directly in my ear - his lips were touching my ear, I elbow him off me (mind you - the babies are sleeping in the rooms next door) and that's when he climbs on top of me, grabs my wrists and pins my hands behind my back with all of his body weight, I couldn't move my hands. He puts one hand over my mouth and then the other over my nose. I start to panic and I realized what was going on. I look up and his eyes were completely black and as if there was no soul. I thought 'this is it, I'm going to die.' I knew he wasn't there. Everything started to go black and then I remember feeling his hands moving down to my neck - he had let go but wasn't done with me!!! This is when I'm able to swing myself with all of my might, out from under him and off the bed. I was freaking the f out. We live in a two story home with all the bedrooms upstairs. I run down the stairs where my phone is and call 911. I WAS TERRIFIED. Hysterical. Not only did he almost just kill me, he looked possessed- those eyes- he was still upstairs where our babies were sleeping!! I thought he was going to kill my daughters. I really fucking did. This is actually the first time I've written this out (other than the victim statement on the police report) and it's kind of therapeutic as I am being gaslighted about the entire incident by my abuser. Anyways, I'll make the rest of this short and sweet... there was a protective order for 61 days and a CPS investigation following the incident.

He admitted when he was released from jail (his mom bailed him out from NY) that he did not remember anything (I knew he wouldn't - his eyes) so I re-capped what happened. He cried, begged, pleaded, promised to never drink again, scared of his mind and questioning his own insanity for not remembering what he did to me, saying he needs help. Fast forward 2 weeks into the protective order (he's staying with a friend) and I find out through some snooping that he has lawyered up ($15k) to fight this charge. None of this is expressed to me as I'm meeting him with the girls at the park - to see Daddy. I never had any intention of getting back with him, I'm done, I love my children more than I love him but you would think that he would communicate with me on whats going on with him legally/medically in a case like this as pertaining to the father of my daughters in domestic violence - UNLESS he was trying to stay quiet so I wouldn't cooperate with prosecution. I bring it up and he goes straight to rage - saying I made the whole thing up and that if this goes to court, everyone will see what really happened. Um, what the fuck? I stop the park visits

So now here I am. I have an appointment with a local DV advocate tomorrow morning. My ex has a laundry list of alcohol abuse convictions - 2 DWI's in NY, 1 in TX and 1 PI in TX. He's 32. I'm not trying to bring a man to his knees as far as the assault charge goes, I will cooperate with prosecution but my main concern is the children - custody.

My question is: Are the alcohol abuse/DWI convictions enough to deem him unfit? In which I would request supervised visitation until/unless he enters treatment and then we can re-evaluate. Or do I need to hire an attorney and make sure he is prosecuted for the domestic violence case in order to to protect my children from this man if he doesn't/until he gets the help he needs?",domesticviolence
I’m too insecure to leave... Help?,"I’ll try keep this short. I am on my mobile so apologies for the formatting. 

I (F20) have been with my current bf (M30) about 1.5 years. We have lived together for one, with both our names on the lease. 

He is everything I’d ever want and everything I fear at the same time. He cleans, does the washing and maintains the house, he works, has paid almost all the bills for the entire time we’ve lived together (I’ve had periods of unemployment) and even paid my insurance excess of ~$1000 when I was in a car accident. 

But he’s also a heavy drinker, like his father. His father can’t stand me, has compared me to Hitler and has on multiple occasions said I need to “grow up” and “stop being a spoilt little bitch”. I have been out with my friends 3 times since we got together, and on all but one occasion have been accused of cheating and told not to come home. In Jan 2020 he got so drunk he left a BBQ we were at and began walking home, only to cuss out my godfather and I when we went to pick him up. We left soon after and I took my thinks to a friends.m for the night. He left multiple voicemails from 30+ missed calls, detailing how he was going to kill me and smash up the house when he got home. He made it home and I wasn’t there so he slept on the couch, and promised to cut down. Another broken promise. 

When sober he tells me I’m the love of his life, when drunk he tell me he loves me but I’m x,y,z (expletive). I am the only one who drives, and he depends on me to get to work (he got this job shortly after we met from an advert I sent him) and I have driven him every day since. We have three cats, on of which is “mine”, another “his” and a third is “ours”.

I am so afraid of leaving because of the constant mood changes and not knowing what will come next. He says my mood swings make him crazy but he stays with me because he loves me. He screams at me until I cry and then hugs me and says it’ll be okay. He’s smashed my stuff and thrown things at me, but never hit me. 

I am so worn down I don’t know what to do. If I leave him he’ll most likely go back to drugs and jail. He will lose his job because there is no other way to get to work before 7am, and I fear for the two cats that aren’t “mine”. 

Some people tell me to leave as soon as possible, others (my conservative family included) tell me to work harder on myself and things will get better. I’ve gone back on my antidepressants and started therapy again. I’m working, and trying to function as best I can. 

I don’t know what else to say, but has anyone else been through this? It’s suck a mindfk that it feels like my head is constantly spinning and I can’t tell what’s right from wrong anymore. Any advice?",domesticviolence
Healing after leaving an abusive relationship,"My last boyfriend, who I was with from 18-24, was very abusive and jealous. When he behaved abusively towards me, I discredited all of his feelings because he was acting so unreasonable. I never considered he was making a real point, mainly because the recurring point was that I'm a ""slut"" that ""flirts with every guy."" I was recently reading about how abusive people have sane, normal feeling, the problem is that they act on feelings with innappropriate behavior. This makes a lot of sense. 

My current boyfriend has pointed out that when I interact with men, the creeper/flirtier a guy is, the more attention I give him. The more attention someone requests from me, the more I give. This explains why all my male ""friends"" end up being guys that wanted to date me and are trying to make moves from the ""friend zone."" 

Long story short, I've learned to mask my social anxiety by pretending to be a happy, ""flirty"" girl. I spent most of high school socially isolated, by choice, with the exception of one person. I think losing them (another relationship) combined with my desire for isolation made me suseptible to an abusive relationship. This made me feel guilty about not being social, so I've spent the last 5 years trying to be more outgoing. 

I don't want sexual, flirting relationships with people, so I've started putting a lot of energy into reading people's intentions towards me and only responding when people approch me with an appropriate, respectful attitude. Interesting life lesson. Being in an abusive relationship can turn you into such an unhealthy person. So much growth is stunted when you don't trust the person you spend the most time with.",domesticviolence
Groping,"I have finally told my husband that I am leaving him. Since then he continues to come up to me only to grab my breasts and squeeze them, knowing I've told him not to. It is every time he comes near me. He won't stop. This feels really silly to file any kind of police report about and I'm worried that if I did call they won't take me seriously and it'll only make matters worse here. Has anyone ever been in that situation? What do you do? Its such a harmless thing that there's no way to prove its happening for court.",domesticviolence
I think my daughter is being abused by her boyfriend and I have no idea what to do,"A bit of history so there’s some context, when my daughter was 17 she was dating this loser I could see it her mum could see her friends could see it but she couldn’t the more I kept trying to get her to see it the more distant she became until we eventually moved out and never spoke to her mother or myself for nearly a year. She broke up with him moved back in to the family house and everything was going fine she met a new guy who seemed a genuine nice guy, they’d been dating for a few months before there was little signs like not liking her putting up pictures of herself on instagram or Facebook, taking her phone jokingly but then going through it, then this pandemic started and the kept seeing each other, her mother and I agreed they needed to try adhere to rules until this was over but she decided that would be to long so was gonna stay with him during this. About a week later she said she would just move in with him so she came collected all her stuff and that was that we would still be in contact regular, about 2 weeks after she got all her stuff her mother received a text  from our daughter asking if she could move home. mother said yes then mother received another text from daughters boyfriend saying don’t worry about daughter as she’s just had little to drink, she’s only feeling that way because I hurt her, so the alarm bells were really ringing then she phoned and said she was ok and she’s just going to go to sleep she will speak to us the next day. Ever since this day daughter has not been as talkative with us at all, then mother received a text message in yesterday morning asking to come home again yes was said daughter even message younger daughter a saying she was moving back as the day went on and we heard nothing back from messages we started to think maybe she’s change her mind we will wait to here back I check on her and her boyfriends instagram it seems they have move to another country in her post and in his post you can barely make out her face but what you can make it it looks like she’s been hit a few times, I could be wrong her mother never seen it when she first looked at the photo, there was a little communication today between mother and daughters boyfriend at first because there was no reply he said she got in a taxi and left, daughter has since contacted and said she is staying with someone else however on both Instagram accounts it seems they are together, are we just overbearing parents looking for signs or should be we general worried. Apologies for the long post I’ve never posted on reddit before but don’t know where else to turn to for advice, I have the picture but like I said it isn’t the clearest and I have no idea if it could be cleared up, if someone knows it would be greatly appreciated",domesticviolence
I think my daughter is being abused by her boyfriend,,domesticviolence
My husband is not letting our daughter eat,"Our daughter is 17 and she made a mistake while reversing my husbands car the other day. She put a small dent in the rear bumper. He has a huge temper and he reduced her to tears as soon as he found out. Since then, he hasn’t let her eat a meal. She’s been coming out of her room with tears in her eyes, but he instead makes her sit at the table and watch the rest of us eat, while she isn’t allowed to touch anything. He keeps asking her if she learnt her lesson yet. Each time she keeps crying and saying that she’s sorry, but he just ignores her when she’s begging for food. 

Shes on five days since her last meal and she can barely sit up in bed. I have to help her to the bathroom because her legs will just buckle. She tells me that it physically hurts to be so hungry. I hope she isn’t in too much pain because that just makes it more terrible to think about. There’s nothing I can do for her, because he’ll basically use me as a boxing bag if I try. He once hit me hard enough to collapse my lung because I was breathing too heavily next to him in bed. Now I’m just hoping that there’s no effects on her body from going so long without eating? I’m scared that she’ll get sick or her organs will get damaged or something. When I went to talk to her earlier, I could hear her stomach the entire time and from 5 feet away. It sounded really bad and I felt terrible just leaving her like that. She begged me to try and bring her some food but I’m terrified of being beaten up, which is what he’s done to me before. So like a coward, I’m just watching my daughter crying and starving because I’m too much of a weakling to handle a few kicks and punches from him.",domesticviolence
What can I do if my brother (18+) is violent??,"I live in a south asian family so it’s common for the sons and daughters to stay home despite being 18+ and for violence to be overlooked so that the family reputation is not ruined. My brother (now 21, I’m a year older) has always been short tempered/violent, he has hit my grandmother even on several occasions growing up as well as my dad, today he again hit my dad and when I went to intervene I was also hit. My dads head is bruised (he didn’t fight back) I don’t know what to do, my dad won’t let me call the police, he always says “we will deal with it” but it has been going on for years now and he’s becoming even more hostile. I fear one day he will use a more dangerous object or cause serious harm to someone (it’s just me my dad and him) I live in the U.K. btw, can anyone advise anything I feel unsafe, my dad won’t do anything, my nan will never testify, my sister (who lives separately) has seen my brother hit my nan, I don’t know what to do, they will be mad at me if I say anything",domesticviolence
Protection order?,"Hey all,

My ex is violating our custody agreement. He was supposed to provide a lease by May 1 in order to take the kids. (There’s reasons he needs to provide this that are another story). Anyway, he didn’t. He refused his lease. 

He’s now saying he’s going to show up at my house and take them whether I like it or not. He’s already said this 3 times, and I imagine in the next few weeks he will ramp up these threats and probably say he’s coming here at least 3-4 more times. And then potentially show up. 

My lawyer says I don’t have to answer the door (because he’s been knowingly violating the custody agreement). However I’m starting to feel a tad bit freaked out...like he’s going to show up and be creepy. I’m about to give birth so I might not even be home and I don’t want to freak out my in laws by telling them “don’t answer the door!”.

My story with an abusive stepfather figure.,"So let's start off with a little backstory.
I was born in October, 2004. I was living with my mother and father, until eight months later they split up because my mum said that I was a mistake and that she no longer wanted me, which caused my dad to move out and find someone new to raise me with (to be my next step mum or something like that). Me and my dad moved in with a single mother of two boys, and this was before I even had my first birthday. My dad and soon to be step mum lived together for 8 years and in that timeframe my little brother was born.

The day came, the day where my dad would walk in on my stepmother and my soon to be abusive sort of stepfather having sex. Things did not turn out well, my dad and stepmum got into an extreme argument, and they started to fight, me and my little brother were inside of the living room where we could hear the while thing unfold. My Abusive stepfather thing was upstairs calling the police to get my dad out of the house. 30 minutes later the police came to drag my dad outside, and while I saw what was happening i kept telling my dad to let me go and live with him, because i loved my dad and he meant the world to me. He was then arrested for two days and then let go when they found out that he was innocent and no one got hurt. A few days after he got out of prison my dad called my stepmother so that he could talk to me. The conversation went something like this (D= Dad. Me= Me)

D:  Hi, son I want to let you know that I'm ok and that I am out of prison now so if you want to talk, I'm here for you.
Me: Ok dad, can I come live with you though.
D: Buddy listen, you cant come and live with me now because I have to work all day and you're only 8, which means that you cant look after yourself.
Me: Yea I can, I'm a big boy.
D: i know you are buddy, but no means no. I am so sorry son, go put me on the phone with mummy and remember I love you very very much.

Little did I know that giving that phone to my stepmother would set off this bomb that was my abusive step father.

After I gave my phone and went downstairs to play with my legos. My ASF (abusive step father) came in to the room I was in and punched me in the back of the head. (He has no problems with alcoholism or a mental health disorder) and he said to me ""Dont you ever talk to that disgusting wife beater again, DO YOU HEAR ME."" 
Me: [crying] ""y-yes""
ASF: ""If I ever hear you speaking to him again I will hit you ten times harder""
Me: ""N-no please dont""

[I am already starting to tear up, and I am just going to tell you all of the significant times and the times that I am constantly being haunted by, because of PTSD]

Time #1: Me and ASF were walking into town to get some groceries, but to get to the town we have to cross this field of grass which is about a mile long. Me and ASF were having a chat (I was 8/9 at the time and I didnt know what he was like). I must have said something that offended him because he started to strangle me and did not let go until I almost passed out.

Time #2: for a few weeks now, I had been going over to my dads every weekend because he was free on the weekends and we both wanted to see eachother. One week though my dad had bought me a new book about trains and when I bought that book home ASF took one look and the cover, saw that it said dad on the cover and then started to hit me with the book. (I was about 10 at the time).

Time #3: ASF had been abusing me on numerous occasions and when my dad saw the bruises on my arms, he asked me about them and I told him about ASF He took me down to the police station to tell my story, the police say the will look into it, but later my dad got a text saying that they can't look into the case because I was only a kid and that I was just making stuff up. This had a huge impact on me and now I have trust issues 

Time #4: ASF had hit me so many times that I was so scared of him, and I was excited to go into school because that was my only getaway during the weekdays. I have tried telling my stepmother and school about it but they all just said the same thing ""that I am just a kid, and I am making stuff up"". I went home extremely upset because no one seemed to believe my story, even when I had the marks to justify my points. At this time I went into the kitchen and saw a huge kitchen knife on the table, just left there and so I grabbed it by the handle and pointed it at my throat. My stepmother was just walking into the kitchen when she saw me with the knife, bawling my eyes out. She rushed over to me grabbed the knife out of my hands and said ""dont be so stupid, nothing has happened to you to make you want to kill yourself.""

Time #5: ASF asked me to do something for him, so I tried standing up to myself and said ""no, do it yourself"".
As soon as I hear him shout ""WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY TO ME"" whilst just walking into my room, I immediately regretted it. He grabbed me, put me into the firemans carry position and walked me into the kitchen and shoved a bottle of washing up liquid into my mouth, he just kept holding it down causing it to empty into my mouth, leaving me with a mouthful of washing up liquid, which he then forced me to swallow it and then he did the same thing, filled my mouth and made me swallow it. Three times he did that three times.

Time #6: I was at school, we were in a PE lesson when I accidentally pushed a girl over and she grazed her leg. School called my house phone where of course ASF had to answer it. I walked home and as soon as I opened the door ASF snatched me slammed the door closed, grabbed me by the throat so I couldn't breathe raised me up to the ceiling and then dropped me. I hit my head on the floor causing me to bleed and he left me there. I still have the scar from where I fell and hit the floor.

Time #7: I was doing my homework when my pen exploded. I asked ASF if I could have a spare but then he got pissed because I apparently did something to make the pen explode, when I told him that i didn't do anything to the pen he got pissed and threatened to kill me by ""throwing me outside the top floor window and stomping on my head"" at that time my dad had met a new girlfriend and had a place with two bedrooms so I immediately ran outside with my phone and called up my dad and I said that i will be there soon. I ran all night, I ran all the way to my dads house which was like 5 miles away and then my dads girlfriend made me move in with them. I will be forever thankful to her because it felt like all of the pain had just stopped. But then a couple of months later I got sent to the doctors where I got diagnosed with Depression, PTSD, anxiety and bipolar disorder. 

That is all I can write down because there are some stuff that I cant say because I will immediately burst out crying, like the time ASF got my pet dog to rape me. (I know that It sounds weird and like a lie but it isnt. I was there pinned down while he watched, laughing while I was left feeling hopeless).

I am sorry if my stories are a bit scuffed at some points I have been crying the entire time I have been writing this and I cant think straight.",domesticviolence

Ok so I’m 14 years old (male) and I’ve had an abusive stepmom for about 8 years and I’ve hated every second of it. But 2 days ago she beat my dad up while I was sleeping. She just gave him a black eye but it looks pretty bad. Anyway she got kicked out and now she’s saying she so sorry and my dads thinking about putting her in rehab to get help and a for her to come back. She’s and alcoholic, bi polar, and just straight up crazy. He told me this right after I got done celebrating that she is going to be gone. Now I’m having crazy thoughts if she comes back like me wanting to kill her, beat the shit outta her, etc. I don’t know what I should do for that and what I should do to not live with her if she does come back.

Abuse,"        No one cares enough to talk about it with me. I know this is pathetic but I went to tell someone about it...they just blocked me. I guess my boyfriend..abuser..was right about no one caring. And no..this isnt for attention. I'm suffering. I'm a teenager..idk how this can be happening to me. I feel like this is just the end of my life. Ans no, I am not going to commit suicide
 No, he cannot hurt me physically now because we are long distance these months. He never hit me or something...but he made me do stuff..... dont know how to get away. Guys...some of the stuff he made me do to myself...it was just...I have no words. 
        2 years ago, I let a guy take advantage of me sexually. I was scared and felt trapped. I didnt know how to stop it. Actually..it would have been easy for me to stop it.  But I felt soo trapped. I was scared and shaking and it happened more than once. And he found out. Well...I told him about it...I told him about it...hmm.. 17 months ago. And since then, he has blamed me for it..he has insulted me horrible..mocked me about it..says he will never forgive me..wont forget what i did. He has talked about it with me for countless hours. If i get mad at him..he says..oh so you can get mad at me but you let him get everything he wanted?(trigger warning coming up..sexual) Oh you wont let me do sexual things with u now but you let him get your body? He calls me used and worthless. He calls me stupid bitch. Today he even did. Yesterday he forced me to put a toothbrush up my ass on a video call. Whyd i do it you ask?? Even tho it's horrible? Because he threatened to leave me and block me if I didnt. And he has ruined me so bad that I now think I need him and love him and want him even when he is doing this to me. He convinced me that no one will ever love me. I'm just weak. Weak. I let guys do that to me. I'm weak. There have been hours and hours of sexual abuse. Why do I endure that? I just have no self esteem or self worth anymore. It's gone. I believe I'm worthless and trash and deserve it for being a slut in my past. I'm sure people will judge me even more now...idk.

Need Help,"I have been working with my local DV organization since the beginning of April. I fled my home March 18th to get away from an increasingly tense situation in which I felt unsafe. I won't go into details at this time but note there is destruction of property, financial abuse, verbal abuse, and public humiliation.  Today, at the advice of my counselor to be sure I am covering my bases, I let him know I will be getting my belongings from the home with the help of others, including my cats. I suggested he go to breakfast with his family so that they're not disturbed and I would leave the key there when I leave. 

He sent back an ugly text saying that I would not be allowed into the home that I am still on the lease for, that I would be taken to court for ""committing libel and slander"", and that I would not be allowed to have my pets because I ""abandoned"" them when I fled. 

The kicker is the exact phrasing is what I used to tell our landlords what happened. Either he managed to look at my emails to them, or more than likely, they disclosed what is said to him since I have been fighting them (along with my advocates) to be released from the lease. So now I'm having a full blown panic attack but I calmly send back that they're my cats and he will not keep all three pets (we had two cats and a dog, and he decided to keep the dog). I also stated I will get a police escort if need be.

Since he works for the jail, he thinks he is above the law and the only authority on legal matters. He then told me the police will not help because it is a civil matter. 

I did not respond to him beyond that and instead called the crisis line for my DV organization. I got hold of someone who helped me and who told me to leave a message for my advocate. I did, stating what I knew at that time. Now I see he also changed the password to my account somehow for the rent which has access to my direct checking account. 

I am afraid something will happen to my cats because his sister (who is there not on the lease) has a history of animal abuse. What can I do? I'm afraid the police won't help me.",domesticviolence
Ways to help neighbors’ suspected domestic violence situation,"Hi, I apologize if this isn’t the place to post this, but I didn’t get much response from asking r/advice, and I figure this is the best place to ask

For several months I’ve heard a male voice coming from my neighbor’s apartment absolutely screaming his head off. Extremely profane. Says “my wife” as he’s yelling a lot so I assume it’s a husband-wife living there. I’ve called the cops whenever he has said anything that sounded like it would lead to self-harm or if I ever heard the woman scream, but they never follow up with me after and it doesn’t seem to help. I finally got apartment management involved but their only solution is to terminate their lease if they continue causing disturbances. 

I don’t feel comfortable getting directly involved since I’m a small woman. And while I’ve never personally met the neighbors, the man came to our door and intimidated my roommate one of the times we called the cops. He also beats directly on his ceiling (literally shaking our floors) and screams at us if we are “walking too loud”, but we are very quiet people, and he does it even when we’re sitting quietly eating/working, so I suspect he hears things. So he has been extremely hostile to us and I’m concerned for the safety of the woman in his apartment.

I also don’t know the whole situation, sometimes he screams about her abusing him. But the screaming happens at all hours of the day and night and I’ve lost a ton of sleep to it and need it to stop. I feel scared to walk around my own apartment or walk by their floor. I don’t want the apartment management to force them out if that means putting a victim on the street, but I don’t know what else to do besides continuing to call the police/notify management as it happens. Does anyone here have any suggestions?",domesticviolence
Online support groups?,"Hello everyone,

I was wondering if there were any online support groups for DV victims. I was a victim of DV about three years ago by an abusive ex-boyfriend.

I want to be able to move on from the pain and psychological scars that my abuser left me and take back control of my thoughts and emotions. I have learned that those who have been abused can become abusers themselves. I am worried that I am becoming emotionally manipulative because of what happened to me. It's a lot, I'd just like to talk to others about it who have been in similar situations and find a group that I can look forward going to. Thank you.",domesticviolence

Covid and the courts,"My partner and I were assaulted by an alcoholic family member a little bit before the lockdown happened. The police arrested him that night, we have a no contact order that has thankfully been extended through everything. The courts have been closed and everything has been on hold. He was charged with 3 misdemeanors, and even though it was violent, because it didn't reach felony level, they are telling us that jail time is unlikely in part due to Covid, even though he was on probation and violated that probation both by drinking and the criminal charges. We also have second hand knowledge of other crimes and probation violations we brought to the attention of the police, but if direct witnesses do not give a report, it will not matter. The police did a tox screen on him that night and found that he was heavily intoxicated. The courts aren't really responding to probation violations due to the virus. 

I am so tired, so frustrated, I fear there will be no consequences for his actions. We have had such a difficult time through all of this. There isn't any recourse because the virus is outside everyone's control. Covid has taken many things, and one of those things is justice.",domesticviolence
Can I report physical abuse by my father that happened in 1993?,"My parents were abusive for my entire childhood. One event that stands out in my memory is when my father punched me in the face so hard that my nose started bleeding profusely. At the time, I thought this was just normal parenting and I deserved it. The reason was that I wanted to watch TV but he didn't want me to. I remember crying and going to my room, feeling absolutely devastated. I didn't even know that this was abuse, or that anyone could help me.

Now, 27 years later, my perspective is different. Is it still possible to file a police report? I don't have any evidence of course, it's not like there were video cameras rolling at our house back then. Of course my father would 100% deny it happened. When I told relatives about these events much later, my father called me a liar, and said I was just trying to make him look bad in front of the relatives.

But just for completeness, and for recording that this event happened, can I call the police? Would they interview him? Since state laws might apply, this happened in Minnesota.",domesticviolence

I just don't want my body to be identifiable,If it was they would call in my parents to identify it and while my mom can go to hell my dad shouldn't see that.

I just don't want anyone other than law enforcement and the funeral workers to see my body but however I look at it that's kind of unavoidable even if it's closed casket. Another thing I would hate is that my mom would be at my funeral blaming it on everyone else except her when it's mostly her fault. And my brother would be sad because I'm the only person he has left in the family who actually gives a fuck about him but with how things are looking I won't be caring about that for too long. My friends think I'm happy and doing well because I went to therapy for a long time but that is not the case.

"I don’t know where to post this, but I hope that this is it.","Tw: child grooming?

When I was 10 years old, I went onto Minecraft, hopped on a server, and tried to make some friends. I met a guy (who I will call V) and we hit it off pretty well. Fast forward about a year and we’re great friends, we do dumb role plays together a lot and talk almost every day.
There’s a problem with this, though. At the age of 8 I found out that porn existed, at 10 I was almost obsessed with sexual stuff and would talk about it a lot with my friends.
My friend V never questioned what I said or did, he never wondered if I was too young to know what I did, he never told me that what I was doing was wrong.
Few years later, I’m now 13. I hadn’t talked to V in about a year, and then suddenly he just appears online again. We hit it off again, good friends, etc etc.
Then he tells me that he’s in love with me.
Then I tell him that I might be in love with him.
Then we start virtually dating.
He made a lot of sex jokes and told me that he really wanted to fuck me almost every day, after learning that I’m trans he said that he wanted to see my breasts before I had my operation (i’m FTM) and that he wanted me to “dominate him” after getting bottom surgery as long as I keep my breasts.
I was 13-14, he was 16 or 18.
We broke up after he said that he wanted me to send him nudes, I gave him a week to try to prove that he was a good person and then we drifted apart, I have been thinking about this every day since it happened.
Was I groomed? Was I abused? Was it pedophilia or ebebtigoephilia or whatever?
I don’t have the answer to any of these.
If anyone does, I would really like the help, and I’m sorry if this is the wrong place to post this.
Thank you for reading, and have an amazing day.",SuicideWatch

"ISO a guaranteed way to kill yourself, while making it look like an accident.","Clearly I'm suicidal, but like many others on here, worry about the emotional damage that will occur after I'm gone. There's another subreddit post listing all the thoughts that go through someone's mind when they're suicidal. All thoughts I share myself.

I've had low grade depression all my life, low self esteem and the inability to make friends, all which have caused trouble in my nearly 13 year marriage. A marriage that is potentially ended with her actively looking for apartments with a goal of moving out by the 1st.

The short of it is I took alot of the things she said defensively as if she was attacking me and she put up with it for longer than she should have. She is the most amazing woman I've ever met, beautiful on the inside and out. I'd beg her to stay, but done that before and it's selfish. I love her too much to potentially cause her more pain...

Which leads to my dilemma, I want to find a way to kill myself that would look like an accident to lessen the emotional fallout after my death, for my wife, mother, grandmother and other family. Not wanting to be alive is something I've struggled with all my life and now that I've  screwed up the most wonderful thing in the world there's really no point in living. 

Most ways have risks that it won't be successful, resulting in permanent, debilitating conditions, like taking pills, poisoning, jumping off a building/bridge/etc., using a gun (something I'd never do), vehicle accident, etc.

How does one successful do this without it looking like an actually suicide?",SuicideWatch

"Depressed, suicidal and an identity crisis.","I’m at the lowest point of my life. I have dealt with depression and suicidal thoughts since I was 12 years old. I’m 25 now and everything has gotten worse for me. I gave up everything years ago. School and the outside world. I have never been treated by a professional. And on top of that, I’m dealing with an identity crisis. I moved to the states when I was 14 years old. I have been here for an entire decade and I still feel like I don’t belong here. I feel like I’m not welcomed here... I haven’t been able to meet enough people. At first it was because of the language barrier, now, I just don’t go outside. I deal with severe social anxiety and it prevents me from interacting with others. Even those whom I feel “comfortable” with. Because I have been here for too long, I also feel disconnected with my birthplace. Granted, I never like it there, but now I’m just a complete stranger. I have been trying to do other drugs to numb the pain. There’s just so much going on in my head and Idk what to do anymore.",SuicideWatch
at this point again,"Although there were many signs early on, it's been maybe 15 years now since the depression and suicidal thoughts started. Between then and now I've had dozens of impulses, attempts, hospitalizations, not to mention countless acts of varying degrees of self destruction. No one even knows about it except my parents and siblings, all of whom have little contact with me because they despise me and blame me for everything. I never had a youth, my teenage years are just a blur of isolation and despair and abandonment, I'm on my way out of my twenties feeling just as hopeless. I've never been in a relationship, and I have very very few friends (well, just my one friend of seven years, up til they blocked me recently).

Things were doing okay for a while and now I'm back here again. It always happens this way. But this time feels different. I'm ready and this time I won't fail. In the span of a couple weeks, my best friend abandoned me after I offered to help them through a tough time (I made a mistake and opened up to them about some personal things), my therapist discharged me because of a difference in opinion on things outside of my therapy (my psychiatrist also discharged me a few months back because nothing seemed to be working), and I have absolutely no one to talk to. I won't call a helpline because they will call the police when I tell them how I really feel and then I'll get dragged back to the hospital. Where I live, the hospital is not a good place to be. One of the head nurses knows me from being there multiple times and actually has a vendetta against me (I know how crazy that sounds. But that's just par for the course when it comes to all the things that have happened in my life). There's no one at all I can get help from, honestly, except other suicidal people I've met and I just can't be responsible for putting them over the edge, as tempting as it is to bleed myself out to them. I believe the emotional and mental darkness in me is responsible for my loneliness and social ineptitude. This darkness feels extremely volatile (I mean in the sense that sharing the burden with anyone could hurt them deeply), like I'm a dementor that can suck the happiness out of everyone. I have actually been described by people as 'negative,' 'a black hole,' and even 'the grim reaper.' It's like I exist to hurt everyone around me.

I have a lot more issues than being lonely, isolated, and terrible at socializing. I have a disorder that is excruciating to deal with and I spent 20+ years of my life suffering in silence without any help at all. My primary symptom is extremely powerful emotions and emotional pain influenced by my environment. I can only describe it as like being covered in open wounds, only emotionally, though it sometimes manifests in physical symptoms. I feel like no one else could ever understand what this feels like. Some would say I am incurable, or at least that's what I believe. Supposedly it can be managed by meds and therapy but that has never worked for me.

The past few months I could feel the suicidal thoughts creeping back in and the last few days I have been in that pit-of-despair, pre-attempt mode that is so familiar to me by now. I blew up my mom's phone with texts last night (I'm always telling her about my suicidal ideation and she usually responds with silence or criticism, which is fine because at least I know she won't call the police). I told her how I feel about a lot of things and I think some of what I said was hurtful. She didn't text back. So I told her that I was really done this time and asked if she would please take care of my pets when I'm gone. She texted me ""do what you have to do"" but said she would dump my pets at a shelter. 

I was planning since Friday to kill myself this morning but it's now afternoon. I was so desperate yesterday for a reason not to do it that I texted my mom and said if she calls me and talks to me I would not go through with it. But she ignored my texts. I even tried calling her and she didn't answer. I look at my pets and feel extremely sad for them. Maybe they will be lucky to find homes that don't treat non-human animals like toys/objects and won't be used as dog-fighting bait. But no one will ever care about them like I do, or know the right way to pet them, or know what toys are their favorite like I do. Animals are the only beings I can relate to and I care about and understand them in a way I feel that other humans don't. But I honestly feel like I can't go on. Especially now that I said all those things to my mom and she basically proved my point that no one gives a shit if I die. I can't bear the thought of going back to work tomorrow at the job I hate and I've already used up all my sick time last week because I couldn't even get out of bed. I've completely given up on taking care of myself and my apartment. The thought of waking up to another day is absolutely terrifying to me. 

My life is pointless, worthless, disgusting, unbearable, cringey, hopeless. Occasionally I feel hopeful and I actually try, but I always end up crashing. I'm here in this place again, the cycle never ends, and the void is calling me home. I know I have only one option and no one else could ever understand. I don't even know why I'm posting here for help, probably because deep down I really don't want to die. Maybe someone here will know what this feels like. I just hope I don't make anyone else hurt by posting this. I know I sound really self absorbed (I am). I know other people struggle with suicidal thoughts too but that doesn't make me feel better.",SuicideWatch

I feel like a hamster running in a wheel, a lot of effort everyday for absolute nothing in return and I cannot stop.

Feeling lonely, unhappy, with a void in my heart/soul that I cannot fill up with nothing, only trying to do it with materialism.

If someone is reading this and is worried, as I said, they adjusted my meds so at least by now I’m not gonna do anything serious.

I don't know what to do. (long post alert),"It's become increasingly hard to stay alive as the years go on. I've spent 14 years waiting for the magical ""It gets better"" that everyone promises... It doesn't seem to be happening, and not for lack of trying. I've just finished writing two full pages of a note, simply detailing why I can't keep going. That doesn't even include the apologies and the messages and the goodbyes. When I finished it, I took a deep breath and thought, ""What do I do now? How do I do it?"" As the tears rolled down my face. So I came here.

I've been suicidal for 14 years, and I always end up going to the internet when it gets really bad. So many times, Google has directed me here. I decided it would be easier to just make an account. If I break any rules, please tell me and I'll fix it. I feel bad for posting here and adding to the well of pain, making it harder on the few who are here to help, but I have nowhere else to turn at this point. I hope you can forgive me.

For a long time, I didn't know why life was so hard for me, or why so many adults asked me if I'd been the victim of sexual assault. My mother actually burst into tears one day and said ""It is 90 degrees outside, you CAN'T wear that jacket! They are going to take you away from me if you keep hiding all of your skin!"" I was the only poor girl at a rich school; the other kids didn't understand me. The boys would pretend to ask me out on dates as a dare and pretend like they were vomiting if I said yes, the girls would do their unspoken Mean Girls thing where they stare me down as they walked past. Par for the course, right? Everyone gets bullied. Then came the lesbian rumors, which of course prompted the boys to ""test"" it. Let's just say I've had my fair share of extreme sexual harassment, bordering on assault. Then the anatomy classes compared assault victims to an old piece of tape that's lost its stick, or a chewed up piece of gum that no one wanted.

By the time I reached college I had a very negative opinion of the male species. A few horrible traumas later and I'm sitting in a therapist's office with a diagnosis of CPTSD and generalized anxiety disorder, working on memory therapy... And I start to remember my childhood for the first time. And it was polluted with frequent visits to the church basement. With the elders. And all the other little girls. Turns out I was the victim of religious cult brainwashing and torture. Yes, that's a real thing, and I battle with the programming they put in my head literally daily.

I haven't had a good life. Always waiting for the ""it gets better."" And better never comes.

Now, I'm 26. The stress of my life over the 26 years has destroyed my body. I have severe fibromyalgia, possibly Sjogren's Syndrome and a whole host of other issues that I can't get diagnosed because I'm too sick to work and I need money to get medical help in this country. I can hardly walk to the kitchen to maintain some semblance of blood sugar stability. I pass out if I shower while standing. Anything I eat makes me horribly sick. I'm starting to show symptoms of kidney, liver and pancreas diseases. Too sick to work, so I'm too poor to see a doctor, so I'm too sick to work. Ad infinitum. In a month, I'm going to be forced to move back in with the same family who took me to that cult every weekend.

My life will never get better. I've tried every government support program and been rejected from all of them. I cannot make it out of my family's house. That will be where I die, listening to them scream at me for not being a good Christian woman and finding a good Christian man. Scream at me for not finding a job regardless of how immobile and sick I am. Work from home jobs are a lie and working for yourself is this mythical thing that only a chosen few in thousands can effectively do, and definitely not the sick and disabled. I'd told myself that the only thing that might make life worth living is love, but who would love someone like me? Sick, damaged, carrying a host of mental disabilities and will never work again? No. No man would have patience with my trauma concerning intimacy and I would never feel safe being with a woman, because of that religious programming screaming in my head that I am evil and I will burn.

I don't know what to do. I can't keep going and I can't move in with my family. I just want to end it.

Mom committed suicided last Christmas.,"She stabbed herself twice in the stomach.
She was the only family left I had. We had only each other. We both were so lonely.. now i am.
Because of economic problems I haven’t been able to move out of where I found her, and her little sad goodbye letter..this place is driving me crazy. This pandemic situation too. I don’t know what’s more unreal yet, what my mother has done on Christmas .. that i buried her next day, on her birthday day, or all the things has happened to the world since then..
I am one step to keep to have nothing to eat, I have no strength to get out or bed, to fight.. I have no nobody, a couple years ago we moved to this country and I don’t have no body here, no body.. 
Every day that passes is one day more that I survived to not do what mom did.. but it scares me even more to think what’s going to happen soon.. if my mind gets more sick, if I have no money, no food, no energy..
So I just can’t stop thinking about it.. then when I think about how difficult it is and how much more difficult economically it could all still go.. I just think about how easily it can all end in 20 seconds if I hang up myself.. and for a while, all the fears of what’s going to happen when it goes worse, stops..
Is it really killing myself too, the only solution?
What’s the solution, when you really have nobody?

"I fought so hard for so long, and it’s all creeping back in. I don’t think I can fight it anymore.","I had a suicide attempt last year. A month or two after, I was feeling better. I was going to my classes. I could sleep. I picked my hobbies back up, I wanted to hang out with people. I felt like I had a new renewal of life. I couldn’t fucking believe it. Even when I had hard days, I fought against it with everything I could. I was so terrified to go back to the way I felt and I was determined to never feel it again. 

But it’s back now. 

I don’t think I can fight it. The urge to self harm is all that fills my mind anymore when I go to work, when I’m at home, before bed. I look at myself in the mirror with disgust. I hate my body, I let myself go and here I am, 50 pounds heavier than I ever could imagine. I want the person in the mirror to die. 

Today while doing the dishes I daydreamed about slitting my wrists, getting in my car and listening to my favorite music as I bleed out. It sounds blissful. 

Yesterday after a fight with my boyfriend I imagined myself popping sleeping pills and going to his house, curling up in his bed to die as he remains blissfully unaware, playing video games on his computer. It seems blissful. 

I’m romanticizing it again. The thing is I feel like I’m having an out of body experience, or like there’s a part of me feeling this, and a party of me watching myself feel this. And neither part knows what to do. 

I don’t want to fight it anymore. My hobbies are chores now. I want to sell everything I have so it’s not a burden further down the line. I just want to die. Life seems so impossible, and I can’t fight this again. I just want to die.",SuicideWatch

My Foolproof Plan,"I’m not currently suicidal. I don’t want anyone reading to think I’m doing this anytime soon. But I do have my plan of action for in the future when the time comes.

I’ve always dreamt of killing myself as this release from the pain. That I would do it and so many people would miss me and love me, and I should leave behind individual notes for every single person I knew as a final token of my time here on Earth. I would leave them with my final thoughts. And I would write a memoir of some of the horrible things I had to witness.

People would read this and finally I would make sense to them. Finally they would understand why I am the way I am and my suicide would be understood. 

But now I don’t feel any desire or need to tell anyone anything. Now I want to slink away into the void and it’s better if no one even knew I was gone. It would be better if the very, very few people that even know I exist never knew what happened to me. To disappear entirely. 

I have no family anymore. No one I consider family. Just a few friends, and please don’t type to me how they will miss me because time and time again in my life it has been proven that truly no one has ever cared. They might care but only to a tiny degree. Not enough to stop me. Not enough for me to want to stop myself.

So here is the plan :

I will build my own personal coffin. I may not have the skills necessary to build it well or sufficiently however I’m sure I’m capable of creating something that will work. 

The me who exists today isn’t suicidal,
I’m not enacting this plan now or even soon. But future me who will be completing this plan, I will choose a location to rest permanently. 

Once I have my location I will dig the hole in my resting place myself. I will place my coffin there and bury it. Then the hard part, and where I need your help with improving this so maybe I don’t need someone else... 

My plan right now is to hire someone to bury me once I’ve passed. I don’t want to be found. I don’t want anyone to know I’m even gone much less where my body is. 

I hope to find someone who would/could be paid off to bury my coffin. Potentially a person who needs money, which I would leave taped to my coffin.. 

So I’m alone, in a remote and hidden location that people don’t often visit. I am locked inside a coffin with which I can’t escape. Then once I’m gone (few days) this individual appears and throws dirt on top of me and I am hidden for all of eternity.

No one knows I’m gone. Messages, texts, calls, they all go unanswered. No one has heard from me. No one knows where I’m at. I’ve disappeared. Gone like a ghost. The perfect getaway.

I don’t say goodbye. I don’t leave my memoir or my notes. I just leave.",SuicideWatch

I feel like I don't have a real problem as to take my life and I just want attention and feel special. I hate it. I hate myself. I wont be able to enjoy anything as I cannot get rid of myself.

I've spent the past year in an absurdly damaging and draining work program, occupying up to 80 hours or more per week of my time.

Now I'm just circling right back into previous despair that I felt before that. At least I never had time to dwell on my past experiences before.

why the fuck not,"should i kill myself.. ?? 

I dont believe in god, neither i do believe in anything other religion or anything ..im fine with the thought of just endless void after death.. (((((if life is a fxking simulation then whats the point + all other conspiracy theories. yeah yeah wow my parents and relatives and friends and people that care about me whatever would be sad oooofcourse yeah but as my life every other life is meaningless too, but still i dont want my close ones to think this way. 

i personally just know i have something wrong with me etc. and i have diagnosed anxiety and deppression but i have medication for that and i still want to go. 

aaaaand i think i could be bpd i have these fucking awesome moodswings from ((happy"""" to angry to good to bad to happy to angry to suicidal.. etc. This morning i was happy for sometime, then minor inconvenience .. and i was angry ... like angry angry and i just yelled and complained about evefything related to the thing that occured. after that i was kind of irritated but kind of doing good at the same time. Annnd later i was so against myself drinking alcohol but yeah i drank and was pretty drunk, i still am :D 

I WAS HAPPY AND EVEFYTHING i like this one person and i felt so close to him but as we seperated and i was alone all thesd thoughts came again like.. ""he doesnt like me"" "" i am stupid to think that they would ever want me.."" etc. 

as i was drowning in self pity i started to think about everything else too death and all that, because when i am sober i have the thought of death too most of the times, but i come to my senses about every people around me and all the things i wouldn't be able to achieve. 

Sometimes i just go to sleep or smth after that, but like now i just think about the stuff like, why the fuck i would need to achieve anything because im going to die anyways, and when i die all of my achievements will be pointless, and everything else is just going to be pointless. why live this pointless life and die when you can just die? why the fuck not to kill myself, if i dont commit suicide today maybe tomorrow will be better but it's still pointless and i always come back to these thoughts. Or maybe tomorrow it will be better and i have the strenght to try to achieve my pointless desires and then i get hit by a car, or have a stroke or something else that results to my death.

maybe someone will be sad after that or mad for being so young to die, but why the fuck. 

I am going to die anyway, maybe not today or not tomorrow or not even in 40 years, but someday and then everything i did in my life will be pointless, i just wake up in some endless void or there is nothing, or there is heaven and hell or i born again in different life... etc.

i have tried to find reason for life, its not love its just fucks me up even more, living your best life is too hard for me because i want to die, and everytime i take something, drugs, alcohol, i have the reason, bevause i don't think about this stuff i just live and do everything and don't really think anything like this. 

And I don't think anyone should kill themselves but at the same time i think I should and everyone else who does that i'm not really against it ... its so confusing even tho these are my thoughts...

     I’m not gonna ask you guys for reasons why I shouldn’t kill myself. And I don’t want any crap like “suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem” cause you don’t know me so who the hell are you to decide that. I don’t even know why I’m posting this. I don’t really have anyone to reach out to and I think I might just want at least one solid person I can actually talk to without feeling judged or scared they might tell someone. 
       
     I’ve told some of my friends about how I’ve been feeling lately but I don’t think they know how to handle this information. They might not even be taking it seriously. My family doesn’t know and I don’t wish to elaborate on that unless someone asks. I’ve tried talking to my school counselor but she’s always so busy. It took her three weeks to find time to talk to me this one time and the first time I had met with her she had gone and told my parents. She’s a nice lady and all but is she even allowed to do that? It had made things worse for me. I hadn’t even mentioned anything about killing or harming myself. Just said I’ve been sad.
       
     I can’t even cry properly anymore guys. And I’ve wanted to harm myself with blades but I’m too scared that someone might find out so I’ve  just resorted to scratching myself or pinching without leaving any lasting marks. It’s kind of sad that I’m this much of a coward. I’ve researched suicide and all the methods and I’ve decided on either shooting myself, wrapping a big filled with only helium around my head, or take a bottle of pills I’ve forgotten the name of. They’re suppose to be pretty strong and I’ve researched the amount it takes to kill you. The problem is I don’t have access to any of these materials and theres always the chance of my survival. When I kill myself I want it to be 100% guaranteed. I don’t want to wake up in the hospital and be forced to go to a psychiatric ward or anything. They wouldn’t allow me to kill myself and would probably make everything worse.
       
     I honestly just wish I had never been born. It’s stupid that we have to be forced into this world and not be allowed to take our own life. We’re all gonna die one day so why does it even matter? I’ve seen a lot of people talk about giving euthanasia to terminally ill people but what about people with mental illnesses? Just because you can’t physically see it doesn’t make it any less terrible. I’ve heard people say things like how people with mental illnesses shouldn’t be allowed to commit suicide because they are not right in the head but does that mean you should force them to live out a life they have no interest in living? Just try putting yourself in their shoes. Don’t call them selfish. What’s really selfish is forcing a person to live because you don’t want to feels sad. It’s like you’re making a person with depression live just so that you don’t have to.
       
     I just hate it. I really do. I don’t understand why I can’t be allowed to die. Honestly it’s not like the world would end if I die. I understand my family and friends might be sad after that but they’ll move in eventually. I might just leave when I turn 18 and then kill myself so they won’t have to deal with my dead body. I won’t tell them where I’m going and I’ll just disappear and put a bullet in my head the next day. But that means I would have to wait 5 years. I don’t know what to do anymore.

"These will be, I suspect, the last words I'll leave. I hope they find their way to my loved ones.","I’m not writing to ask for a shoulder to lean on, or some kind/calming words, or even some kind of digital hand up.

Instead, I’m writing to leave my last words.

This will be lengthy, and honestly isn’t worth the concern or attention of most. I hope, though, you’ll leave it up. 

My intention is to link this post in an email that will send tomorrow morning, ideally 12+ hours after I’ve made my attempt. That way… Well, my body won’t be left unfound for days or weeks, and if my attempt fails (which I hope it doesn’t) – then perhaps I can be saved. 

So… Circumstances first, yes?

I have pretty severe OCD (centrally manifesting as contamination fears) and depression. This pandemic has been immensely challenging for me. I was already immensely isolated, but suddenly that isolation became more absolute (for lack of a better word). While my neurotic-mind did begin generating fears of catching Covid19, that fear didn’t really ‘take hold’ as much as I feared it would. Instead, what became the more constant anxiety-provoking problem was my inability to obtain simple supplies my OCD demanded I use in excess: cleaning supplies, disposable gloves, some toiletries…

If that was the worst of it, things would be approaching a greater degree of balance as stores begin to adapt to the increasing demands on their stock.

Instead, other challenges have found me…lost, and overwhelmed even as some circumstances began improving.

My therapist and psychiatrist work out of the same office – and despite having two forms of insurance (Medicare and Blue Cross Blue Shield) there are limitations to what they cover. Meaning… My treatment has been building a past-due balance that I can’t afford to pay down. Now my therapist/shrink have informed me they will not honor further appointments without that balance being resolved (in part or in total). I still have a couple months of prescription refills, but now I have no foundation of medical care to lean on.

And then… Two weeks ago (right when my therapist stopped upholding my appointments) I had a major plumbing problem. Actual human waste began backing up my shower drain. I spent money I didn’t have getting the most immediate problem fixed, but was given a bill for another $800 to fix the entire problem. A family member, in immense generosity, helped me cover a portion of the expense. But the remainder will wipe out most of what I have in my checking account, leaving me unable to pay my other bills.

Having to clean the shower after the immediate problem was fixed… I don’t even know how to describe the anxiety. I used so much bleach my eyes were teared and blurry. I felt like I couldn’t breathe. I kept gagging, struggling not to vomit. And when I finally finished all the cleaning, I had to shower for over 90 minutes – coming out…broken and exhausted, and just collapsing in bed.

I’m having to pause every few moments as I write this because I’m breaking down sobbing.

I’m to the point where I can’t fix my financial affairs, I don’t have a therapist/shrink anymore, I can’t even come close to maintaining my environment as my OCD demands… And I’m dealing with all of this in nearly complete isolation.

I’ve had moments where few things in my life brought me joy. But only fleetingly has \*nothing\* brought me joy. That’s the continuous moment of despair I find myself trapped in now: unable to find anything that acts as a light in the otherwise exceedingly pervasive darkness.

There are things I should do before ending my life.

Preparations I should make, words I should offer, feelings I should voice, and apologizes I should give.

…but for the most part? I can’t.

As I’m writing this, its 4:27 PM in my area. I was supposed to have a telehealth appointment with my therapist between 4 PM &amp; 5 PM. I tried to call their office about a half dozen times today – hoping to offer some tiny payment in the hopes they would honor the appointment their automated system still lists. I just got voice mail and busy signals.

That was my last hand reaching out for help.

I know - I could call 911. But I don’t want empty, meaningless words from a stranger and a rapid escort to a hospital.

To my loved ones…

I’m sorry. I know those words will ring hollow, but they’re sincere. This isn’t anyone’s fault, apart from my own. I know saying that does little to ease this reality, but it’s true. I’ve made this choice, and none of you are remotely responsible. I’m sorry for the chaos and mess I leave in my wake.

How do you feel emotions?,[removed],SuicideWatch
Most anti-suicide rhetoric is condescending bull,"shit, and even when it comes from people who themselves have struggled with suicidal ideation, and I'm forced to conclude that everyone who feels the same way as I do about condescending bullshit and has the same suicidal feelings I do just goes through with it.

&amp;#x200B;

Point 1: It's a permanent solution to a temporary problem.

And? My house has an ant problem right now. That's temporary, because we have ant traps and poison and stuff to kill the ants. If you told me ""I have a permanent solution to your ant problem"", I wouldn't be like ""no, temporary problems should never be solved permanently."" I would say ""oh, cool, glad I can permanently solve it.""

Also, the fact that all of my  problems will end when I eventually die of heart disease, cancer, lower respiratory infection, or a stroke doesn't make them trivial from my perspective, since from my perspective, my lifespan encompasses essentially all of time.

&amp;#x200B;

Point 2: You don't actually want to die, you just want relief from your problems, and relief is a feeling, which you can only feel when you're alive.

This is just straight up not true of me. I periodically become overwhelmed with emotion, become unable to focus on anything, and get an irresistible urge to injure myself. If that were to stop happening, I wouldn't feel ""relief"" because these episodes only occur periodically anyway. 

I have no real goals or aspirations and can't imagine a future where I'd be content. If this ceased to be the case, I wouldn't feel ""relief"", because I would then be faced with the hard work of actually working towards those goals, aspirations, and imagined futures.

I want to not have to face my problems anymore, not to ""feel relief"" from them.

&amp;#x200B;

Point 3:  As long as you believe you'll never be happy, you won't be.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, as long as I'll never be happy, I'll believe I'll never be happy. If changing my behaviors is difficult, how is changing my beliefs supposed to be any easier? I at least have some sense of conscious control over my actions, even if, on a deeper level, that conscious control feels like a paper thing illusion plastered over me doing whatever dumb stuff my brain shits out. There's not even an ILLUSION of direct control over my beliefs, so this statement basically amounts to ""You're depressed because you're depressed, and to stop being depressed you must simply stop being depressed."" which, fuckin genius, never would have thought of that, thanks.

&amp;#x200B;

Point 4: All you have to do is stay alive.

&amp;#x200B;

That's NOT all I have to do though. As soon as I'm no longer immediately suicidal, ""all I'll have to do"" will involve fixing myself, developing goals and aspirations, and becoming a contributing member of society, you know, all the stuff I feel incapable of doing and have no motivation to do anyway. This kind of line always makes me feel like a member of a cult trying to leave and then suddenly being confronted once again with the same rhetoric given to new recruits about how easy and rewarding the cult's practices are.",SuicideWatch
"28 years old, never gad a friend, never been in a relationship, jusr endlessly lonely","

I am 28 I live in Canada and minus a few construction jobs where I made 18 or so an hour I have always worked for minimum wage, which at least I can survive on $14 an hour is what in getting right now. I have never done any post secondary because I am awful at schooling, I fail pretty much every year I have taken so I am not willing to risk the massive amount of money that post secondary takes.
The only redeemable thing about me that I can think of is that I am good with money, making $14 an hour I have no debt of any kind I live with a roommate and manage to pay all my bills.
But I am honestly at a loss for what to do with myself, I don't see a point in living another 50 years if i am just going to making just enough to pay my bills and be alone but I honestly don't know what if anything I am capable of accomplishing.

Missing Best Friend,I haven’t been here for a while but I just couldn’t help myself. My best friend from the other side of the world (she moved after we met) hasn’t been responding to me for three days. Other people would think I’m overreacting but we call EVERYDAY for hours. We cannot go a day without talking for a least an hour. She’s my most favorite person in the world and I would’ve been dead by now if it wasn’t for her. She’s my pseudo sister. I don’t know what I’ll do without her. I’m becoming more suicidal by the days.  I don’t know what happened. We were in good spirits because we won a game. Then she texted me saying she won’t be able to talk anymore and I just assumed she meant that she had to go. We said our byes and that’s the last time I heard from her.

I’m Suicidal Everyday... I hate being a lonely friendless loser,"Everyday that I wake up and breathe air I want to DIE. I would trade my life with someone who is already DEAD. I am an emotional wreck but I don’t cry that much anymore.. I just get very angry now to the point where I want to just hurt someone or damage something. I’ve seen therapists &amp; psychiatrists since I was 14, i’ve been admitted to the hospital and i’ve been on anti depressants. I’m not on anti depressants now and i’m no longer seeing a therapist I stopped that around 18 or 19. (i’m 22 going on 23 in August 5th) but I feel resentment being raised how I was raised. I was raised by narcassists; my mom is mean to me and we’ve gotten into it phsyically before, she’s naive to certain things, cares what people think and gets off on yelling at me for small things. My dad is more passive but can aggressive, emotionally abusive, he would talk down to my mom to and get in her face. He would call her fat. He’s even called me fat after leaving me at 14 to go live with his brother and then coming back at 18 for my high school graduation in 2015. He can be boring with a dull personality as well and I hate speaking to him sometimes because he always sounds like i’m annoying him when we talk.He demands me to do things for him and gets frustrated easily and when people have disrespected me in public in front of him he never defended me.(what a man!)I have an older brother who has his own life in a different state with his soon to be wife.. no kids yet. &amp; my sister is an a butthole to me shes close to 40 with one kid by a man who lives in another country that she met online. I feel like shes always been jealous of me and thats why she always talks to me im a rude tone. I was trying to my sister this morning about me finally getting my associates degree but her vibe was off and i confronted her about it and she said “thats life people won’t be happy all the time you have to get over it” no but shes in this mood alot but I hear her on the phone laughing with her “friend” she treats outside people better than her own family. She doesn’t help my mom pay any bills but my mom doesn’t want to put her out. She has also manipulated me and mom for our personal information and ran up alot of money on things she hasn’t paid for in my mothers name. She signed me up for something and said she’d keep paying for it and she didn’t. I’ve been bullied ever since i’ve been enrolled in school and I’ve even got molested publicly in elementary during an after schol program. I know someone witnessed and turned a blindeye.The people in charge basically brushed it off even when my mom and sister came because the boy said he didn’t do it and then I witnessed him trying to molest another girl and she yelled at him. As much as my parents annoy me at times if they pass away I have no one and thats what scares me the most. I want to die because I’ve always felt like a loser and an outcast, i’m black, i’m apart of the LGBT community, idc about labels but I was born female. I have a high school diploma, awards, had a workstudy job, a permit to drive and an associates degree. I’m unemployed but i’m a student at a university that I hate and I’m getting bullied here to after leaving the community college I was at in 2018. It just sucks because I have to look out for myself. I have enemies that I don’t want. I get harrassed at home and school. People randomly say they hate me and I wish I didn’t care but I kinda do because i’m a nice person who doesn’t bother people. I just hate my life and i’ve tried to commit suicide so many times I can’t even count and I have no friends every person I’ve met has been fake so idk just felt like venting. Plus I have a condition that makes me smell so ppl avoid me like the plague and I sweat alot but ig its getting kinda better but not really. Also I get called ugly alot and my self esteem is low and I’m developing self hatred and kinda hating my race when I don’t want to but yeah i’m just over this life.

I give up,"I’ve tried writing this about a hundred times. Every time I begin writing, I end up deleting the post because what’s the point of writing this? Nothing’s ever gonna change. 

I guess I’m writing this now just to finally get it all off my chest. If I’m being honest, I don’t think I have a lot left in me, but hey maybe someone here will be able to help. 

I first realized I had depression in 7th grade. I realized that it wasn’t normal to always be sad; and it definitely wasn’t normal to have constant thoughts of killing myself. Fast forward 7 years and I’m still having these thoughts every single day. It’s easy to say now that I should’ve tried to get help in the last 7 years but the truth is I don’t know who I would talk. I have a terrible relationship with my family (I think the fact that they’ve never noticed that i’ve been depressed these last 7 years is indicative of that), I don’t have any friends that I’m close to, and I don’t have money for therapy. I’ve only ever told one person and that ended up making my depression 100x worse but that’s a story for another day. 

Life went on and I learned to live with it. It didn’t really affect my life, and I was great at hiding it. During the day I would be the happy guy that always had a smile on his face, but every night i’d be crying myself to sleep. That’s pretty much how all of high school went. 

Anyways this last year I felt like my depression was progressively getting worse. I began losing hope that I was ever gonna get better. And then, in a desperate attempt to put some hope into my heart, I decided to fall in love with a girl. And not just any girl, my closest friend. I fell super hard and put all my hope that everything was gonna be okay some day into her. I guess my depressed mind mistook every signal that was there and thought she liked me back so I decided to be honest with her and told her about how I felt. Not only did my plan backfire and she said she didn’t like me back, she also said it would be best if we took a break from talking. 


So yeah that was a week ago and now I have nothing left. I have no friends and no one to talk to. My depression is at an all time high. I literally can’t function anymore. I wrote a rough draft of a suicide note, planning on finishing that up later. So yeah that’s where i’m at right now. No more hope. 

I would just end it all right now but I’m too pussy to do that cuz “I don’t want to burden my family” and blah blah blah. I really don’t know what to do anymore, i’ve never been this low. I’ve given up already but now what.",SuicideWatch
Feels like the last straw a hundred times over,"This is my first post ever after reading a bunch of other posts and trying to sort through all my own feelings and trying to relate what everyone else is saying to what's going on with me. I would prefer not to go into great detail, but I guess you can say it's the usual problems people run into that make them feel overwhelmed.

For as long as I can remember I have felt like dying would be so comforting, like I'm not cut out for life and that all this bullshit I deal with from people around me is just not worth it. I have looked up every way a person could kill themselves hoping that maybe, just maybe, one time a different answer would come up that didnt seem so scary and unsure. For years and years I have searched every part of the internet for an answer that would not seem hard to pull off, or too painful or scary to execute. 

It all comes in waves, but I never truly feel happy even when I'm feeling my ""best."" Like I have wasted my life. I feel like not a single person in my life understands me and I feel so alone and helpless. 
Even the people closest to me will never understand me, and I really feel that dying would be the only escape from this stupid life. i just simply dont want to live it anymore. I am so frustrated, and all I do is sit alone and cry.

I have not and probably wont go to anyone for help, because no one in my life will understand or they will tell me I'm being dramatic or that it's not that bad. I also wont reach out for help because I refuse to be thrown in a psych ward.
Everyone in my life makes their problems out to be more severe and important than mine would ever be, so how do you go to anyone for help or to vent?

I am just getting my feelings out here, I am not really expecting anyone to have any magical answers for me and that's okay, I know there aren't any anyways.

And I know you may think ""you just gotta find your happiness"" or ""find things worth living for,"" but that is just not possible.

Why are people more concerned keeping you alive than actually helping you?,"I've been suicidal most my life, since about 8 years old. Most of the time, it's been passive, like wanting to die but not taking active steps to end it. But there have been flare-ups, once when my brother died in 2011 from alcoholism, and another major one in 2014 when I took on way more than I could handle with work, school, friends, etc. 

I noticed when I talked to friends and family about this issue, which wasn't very many, they appeared more concerned about keep me alive than actually helping with the issue. 

Why convince me to stay alive when what I needed from you was someone to talk to without being crushed for all the things I havent done in life? Why would someone say, ""Please don't do that, we'd all miss you"" when that person and everyone else never reaches out to me, has abandoned me, and forgotten me when I needed someone to just acknowledge I existed? Why is it after I told my parents and a select few of my friends about my suicidal thoughts, that they immediately jump to guilt-tripping me, instead actually giving me an ounce of the fucking emotional support I needed from you all those years ago? Why not help now? 

I get frustrated, because it comes across as fake, disingenuous, and half-hearted in their attempts to ACTUALLY help you feel better, than trying to convince you to stick around. 

If not for my therapist, I would be dead right now. She listens to me, and actually tries to help me. Never has she guilt tripped me for my suicidal ideation, because these are feelings I can't ignore or say is just a product of a chemical imbalance. And even with her, I'm still not recovered. 

What would help more than a professional I pay to listen to me and help me? If the people I loved and cherished would listen, would reach out, would take actual action instead of the bullshit tokenism I get when this was brought up.

I have suicidal thoughts and I don't know what to do with them.,"TRIGGER WARNING: suicidal thoughts and eating disorders

Sorry for the long post, tldr in the end. 

Someone suggested I post this on this subreddit so here it is. 

Context: I'm 26, unemployed though have a great degree, have been abused my whole life by family and bullies and teachers alike, have a wild array of mental illnesses caused by that.

I ran away from home and moved in with my boyfriend (to his dad's house) who is an amazing person generally. The thing is, he broke up with his previous gf to be with me. We have a past going way back, and we sort of just fell in love again when we talked again after several years. He didn't have time to grieve the loss of that relationship, which he's doing now. He told me he misses her and he doesn't usually think about her, but when he starts thinking he can't stop.

He also learned his lifelong best friend had been hitting on this ex, breaking one of the biggest bro codes. Well, he learned that a few hours after I saw on his phone that he had texted his ex saying he missed her. I told him that's unacceptable and it won't happen again or I'm gone. 

I know a lot of people will say just break up with him now but I'm not going to. He deserves a chance to grieve a relationship that he ended on bad terms, and I'm accepting this one fuck up as nothing more than a fuck up. He doesn't have any other bad points yet that would have me end my relationship and for me this is just human nature. 

The thing is, since this happened, I have a whole lot of bad thoughts. My eating disorder I feel is relapsing, and I've been in recovery for about a year now and all that might go to waste. I can't afford to see my therapist at the moment since neither me nor my boyfriend have any proper income, only some allowance from parents.

I constantly have thoughts like ""I've never been happy, all the people I should be able to trust wholeheartedly has hurt me one way or another, what's the point in staying alive?"" or ""If I were dead I wouldn't need to deal with all this shit."" I haven't been this suicidal in maybe a year as well. I had been recovering on a lot of levels.

I was used to being suicidal all the time before but I've been okay for so long now that I have no idea how to handle this. I keep taking xanax (prescribed to me alongside an antidepressant) but I'm running out and I don't want to keep taking it and develop an addiction. I don't know what to do with myself once the thoughts come out.

How to deal with being suicidal? Or intrusive thoughts? Any advice is appreciated.

It is my birthday and all I wish for is to be dead,"Just now it is officially my birthday in my time zone and I feel like the biggest gift I could get is dying. Ever since this pandemic started my life us falling apart.
I lost 3 months of my scholarship, I don't have money, I am drowning in stress from university, I am unable to function and study well at home. All I wanted was to move out to university dorms next year but now it's lost and I'm stuck at home far away from everyone. 

I haven't spoken to a single human being I know in person since March. I've only spoken to my family. The only real life conversation I had was an argument with a classmate since we can't work together. I am so lonely it's destroying my sanity. Everyone I talk to daily (by chat) ditches me when I try to open up. All my attempts to initiate conversations just die since I message people and they just ignored me. My loneliness is killing me. 

I lost my therapy because if the pandemic and I don't even have who to whine to. I could never open up to her anyway. I've distanced myself from all of my on-line friends before the pandemic because I was dealing with very difficult mental issues i couldn't bring myself to even talk about in therapy. I am so lonely I only wish for death.

3 months ago I had a falling out with 2 friends who I've known for a decade. One of the last things one of them told was was ""enjoy having a friendless miserable life"". They were right. This is my life. I have nothing. I never had anything besides online friendships and I've lost them too. Fucked them all up. I tried to kill myself 2 weeks after that but I failed pathetically, really pathetically. I am currently living a friendless miserable life. That is what I am. I am failing at university. I have no hopes for my future. I have no dreams and aspirations. All I wanted is to have some fun before I inevitably go. It's all gone now... all the little I had and the little I hoped for is gone. I go on walks every day trying to find the courage to go missing, to jump in front of a truck, to plan a train suicide. This pathetic life is not worth living. I have nothing to look forwards for, no hopes no potential. I just want to be gone. I just want this insufferable pain to end.",SuicideWatch

think I'm gonna hang myself tonight,"I have managed to live 21 years without ever developing a single applicable skill or any connection to any person or place or thing. I am a nowhere human. When I was a child, I experienced so much social and academic failure that I simply gave up on life. It's too late for me, now. I am permanently unformed.

I can't drive. I literally miss stop signs because of how little I focus on anything. I can't work anywhere; I get so upset by any kind of adversity or aggression that I have a breakdown. I have to go to a commuter school, because I can't live on my own or with other people outside of my family, because I can't handle any kind of interpersonal conflict or feelings of inferiority without eventually breaking down over it. When I experience any pain or discomfort, I start to cry. I'm a large, 21 year old man, and I start sobbing like a child when something starts hurting. I don't know why I'm like this.

I do not interact with other people. I have no frame of reference for it. The internet is the only tolerable medium by which I might interact with anyone, and even then, I truly don't understand what to say to people or what to think of what they tell me.

I think I hate the world. I think I hate everyone in it. I don't have any of the positive thoughts or feelings or memories that even other depressed people seem to have.

I’m trapped,"I am trapped. I have no way out. I’m in a horrible situation and a horrible life with no way out and even if I did get out somehow it wouldn’t be worth living. My father mentally and physically abuses me and gaslights me to think I’m crazy and that I need help. My mother is mentally weak and easily manipulated by him. She believes his lies. He pushes me against the wall and shoved me to the ground and swings at me but when I punch him back he calls the police and tells them I abused him. He has it out to ruin my life and it’s worked. I feel so unloved by my mother because I know if she loved me she would do something. He uses false rhetoric to humiliate me in public like “I hope she gets help” when he’s the one who needs help. I just need away from him and I have nowhere to go. In private, he calls me an idiot, an ungrateful piece of shit, he tosses gifts I’ve given him in the trash, he screams and spits in my face. He does these things and then records me getting angry and sends them to my friends and loved ones. Now nobody wants to be with me anymore. And no one believes me. I can’t live like this anymore with no one on my side. No one to stand up for me. I’m not strong enough to stand up for myself anymore. Everyone I’ve ever loved thinks I’m crazy and a bad person. I think I must be but I don’t know. I don’t know what’s real at all anymore. I just know I only have one way out.",SuicideWatch

It’s good to know that I can still feel things, that I’m not completely numb but I’m just so overwhelmed right now. I feel like Im inherently flawed and unlovable, that I just came to this world defective and I shouldn’t be here. I feel like a burden, like I have nothing to offer to anyone. At this point I’m just a bystander in my life, things just happen to me and I just go with it like a dead fish or something. I feel so guilty for being alive and not making anything of it.

I’m ashamed of myself and I don’t feel like I have anything to offer to my friends and family.

My sister in law,"Hey all, we will call her Jane. I love her as if she was my own sister and I’m deeply concerned. I am well versed on what not to say when talking about suicide because I myself have had some issues in the past. My issues are one of the reasons I’m so concerned for Jane. She has recently attempted suicide and I believe she is in a mentally abusive relationship with a man that I truly liked a lot until I learned of how he treats her. They both have drinking problems and when they drink that’s when the abuse starts. I’ve only witnessed snippets of this type of abuse, the name calling, the belittling tone.... according to my other sister in law this guy also has used her suicide attempts against her in arguments.

I get the best thing to do would be to get her away from him. But she lives 10 hours from immediate family and has no job due to COVID. Another problem being, I don’t think she will accept help. She is the eldest of the 3 sisters and wouldn’t want to reveal these things, as it would make her feel vulnerable. I just have no idea what to do and I want to stop her from doing anything.

I’ve been there... once you attempt suicide, in my mind, it’s not a matter of if, it’s a a matter of when. Time is running out and I am just worried. I don’t want to say something and cause more harm. All the internet resources out there tell you to get help from all these different suicide prevention places but what if the person doesn’t want help.

I know I had to want help before accepting help, but I’m afraid that we can’t wait for her to want help.

Please help me and more importantly help Jane.",SuicideWatch

I’m done with it- if I’m fully aware of the fact that I can at any point just end my existence then why am I still plaguing myself with worries and doubts? I should be doing every single thing I want to do because bottom line is, if it goes wrong I’m no worse off than I was when I started- I can still just end it.

"Anxiety,depression, health problems and suicidal thoughts","So im a uni dropout, said this isnt for me and left, as soon as i told my parents i felt the dissapointment and i said id try a new course next summer. So next summer comes and im split between couple of universities and different courses,meanwhile im dealing with depression and IBS (irritable bowel syndrome), very stressfull time , felt more dissapointment, my relationship with my parrents is going even worse. So i decided lets try and find a job and see what will happend. Problem is that my IBS is becoming worse and worse with an insane pain that there are days i cant even go out because of.  I started feeling more pressure from my parents to make a decision about what to do uni or a job which made things even worse to the point that there isnt a day that im not in severe pain. During that period of time i developed tinnitus which is making life even more depressed. Fast fowarding to the next uni admission i started realising no matter what course id pick ill still not like it because its just not for me. At the same time my parents got pretty angry at this point and from that i started having  panic attacks from all the stress. I started having suicidal thoughts pretty much everyday, its the only thing that feels like the corrent answer for everything  Its been 3 years since i dropped out and every summer i go through hell trying to decide if i should return to  studying or find something suitable. Every time anxiety attacks, stress from missing our,fear of the future, sleep sleep deprivation and im also dealing with a shit tone of other health related problems.. Last summer i dont think there was a night id slept for more than 3 hours, lost around 8-10 Kilos from not eating. Since last week its been the same. I already feel unwell, im having shortness of breath and a really weird fealing in my chest. Honestly the only thing i want right now is to die. I dont really find any enjoyable thing to do, i lost most of my friends, future seems rought and dull. I just want to feel happy for once or the depression and anxiety to stop. I think soon theres gonna be a day i just snap and decide to end this pathetic life of being a dissapointment.

The only reason I haven’t killed myself yet is because I fear death.,"I don’t stick around because I have any hope for the future - I stick around because, even though I want to die, I am also afraid to.

Life is way too hard. I don’t understand how anyone can be happy with having to spend most of their time working. I just graduated high school and am going to have to spend the next few years stressed out in university. Then, when I’m done there, I get to go be stressed out at a job instead. Yay. Fuck, even the process of selecting and enrolling in university courses makes me feel frustrated enough to punch a wall, and hopeless enough to want to cry. I had a privileged upbringing and loving parents, and my university tuition will likely be completely paid for without me having to take out any student loans - I’ve had it so much easier than so many other people. Yet, I always feel like everything I face is far too challenging for me to deal with. I am so weak.

Nothing in my life is worth fighting through the bullshit to experience. Killing myself would be so easy - I have access to a whole locker full of guns. And yet, I can never bring myself to do it, because I am too scared of the moment I will blink out forever.

So instead, I have to keep fighting, one day after another, receiving nothing for my efforts but more stress and more feelings of complete hopelessness. Having OCD and GAD certainly doesn’t help.

I want to go, but can’t, because I am a coward. I think a lot of people would kill to have things as easy as I do, but instead of being happy about it, I have spent so much time wishing that I was never born.

The thing is, I don’t even have clinical depression. I see a therapist, and, while I was diagnosed with OCD and GAD, I was not diagnosed with depression after taking a test. Everything that I feel, I feel because I am weak, not because of any sort of chemical imbalance in my brain.

I spend so much time wishing for things to get better, and they never, ever do. Yet, I can never escape, because I am too much of a pussy to just pull a trigger.",SuicideWatch

I don't want to talk about it,"I don't need to talk to people who will just say vapid things like ""I understand"" and ""your feelings are valid."" 

I want to not exist because being around other people is terrible. I hate seeing other people succeeding in life pursuits or even simply being able to enjoy themselves. The only time I ever feel okay is when I don't feel like me; that's why I'm a piece of shit who only likes to play video games or watch movies. I can't even just relax in silence without intrusive thoughts like ""wouldnt it be better if you were dead? Isn't existence a horrible curse?""

The one thing that really fucks me up about wanting to die all the time is that, yes, I truly want everybody to feel terrible when I'm gone. I hate feeling awful all the time, I think other people deserve to go through what I'm going through. If anybody's suicide is going to be ""selfish"" it will be mine.",SuicideWatch
Need to express massive pain without being judged,"I have been spiraling down for 7 months, which have been the worst of my life since my boyfriend of 4 years decided one day that he was done and never seemed to be worried that I am in complete agony. I used to be someone quite social, to go to the gym, to wear nice clothes, make up and jewelry, to try to do my best at work and school, prepare myself a solid life that was compliant with my needs, tastes and beliefs. And in half a year, I just lost everything, I feel rejected by everyone because I don’t have the nerves to pretend I am doing okay in front of all the friends we shared and who I miss so much. I became sort of a toxic monster, I fear that any acquaintance thinks I am a stupid bitch, I am just ashamed that someone I care so deeply and genuinely about threw me to the trash without any hesitation. What does it say about me ? No one in my close circles will ever need me, be happy to be with me, ask me for advice, or anything. And as the situation evolves, I am afraid of feeling this huge anger building up inside of me making me becoming petty and resentful against everyone because I just felt too much rejection, when I don’t believe I deserved. But who am I to say what I deserve ? 

The very fact that someone can just stop caring at all about somebody who were their best friend and partner is beyond my capacity of rationality. I cannot imagine building anything now that I just lost so much, and I am just tired to hear anybody say « you’ll be fine ». I am NOT fine, I spent the last few months at my parents’, going to the therapist, taking stupid medications that are not more useful than tic-tacs because sadness is not a disease and I cannot just « put this in perspective ». I am TIRED of everything and of judging myself for feeling so low. I tried to alert friends, family, my ex, his family because I care about them so much and I cannot imagine that I am just out of the picture now. And I am just done. I am tired of this bullshit that « you know love may disappear without anyone being at fault », I cannot picture life like this where bonds we share with others are just so contingent and fragile. In my bones, I cannot go on with this. I fully accept my mistakes and I am beating myself up for everything I should have done better but I am becoming utterly insane that I was let down without a warning signal without anything. I am posting on this sub and not r/BreakUps, because I reached a tipping point where nothing makes sense for me anymore.

We all have our limits, our sensitivity and my sense of anything is just destroyed. I feel broken and on my last legs. This is not even a cry for help as I am quite sure that I need to end it all to just get the mental pain and exhaustion away from all this.

Or at least thats what would be said by an outsider, its hard to come to terms with something thats always been out of my control. It had been an accumulation of several different factors, child hood trauma, depression, quarantine and school. And so I decided I couldn’t take it anymore, these last few months have been absolutely hell and have only made me so unmotivated and I came to the conclusion that I choose death over living which is an extremely hard pill to swallow I guess. So I had it planned out and was so close to following through with it when I just decided that I have so much to look forward too! And it came at the right moment my little epiphany that I ran to my moms room and told her everything (except on my plans to actually end it) and I just cried in her arms like I never have before. It was so comforting being so open with my mom and actually having the strength to explain to her whats going on. I had chosen life today and I’m grateful I did. Sometimes its the people who are happiest on the outside that are hurting the most. Make sure to reach out to that friend who always looks out for everyone.

I'm lonely. So lonely. I have a wonderful family that loves me and takes care of me even though I'm already 19. I've had only one girlfriend which lasted less than 5 months, and yes, she broke up with me. I've downloaded tinder, and the one girl I was really hitting it off with just ghosted me, out of the blue. I have sone matches from time to time (1/2 per week) but the last two just talked for a couple minutes then left me on read. I miss human affection so much. I've started taking antidepressants and they help, but just a little bit. I'm slacking off with my studies and have a lot of work ahead of me if I want to pass this semester. I just, want, need, some love. I miss falling asleep with my ex in my arms, and the sex, I miss the sex so much. I just want someone to love me but I don't even love myself.

Hard truth,"Hi. Ive been battling depression for few years now (im 19) i started taking pills about a year ago. Changed them few times. Didnt help. I decided i would stop taking pills. And focus on myself. I connected with school psychiatrist in psychologist and i have weekly session. He says i keep getting better.  I just look on the inside. I just have the same thoughts. Always do. I just keep lying so i would have peace.
I told him i have problems in family. I get money they lend me their cars the buy me food and clothes. I just cant tell them i dont want those things. I want a kind word. A hug. I love you. Anything that evolves true emotions towards me. They keep yelling and me, blaiming me for everything, just kaking fun of me what i believe in and what i do. They get mad, yell at me im sick i need to get help. I do something and its always wrong.
Everyday i think about my cat and dog and my gf i cant leave behind. Those are the things important to me. This is what keeps me going.
When those are done. Im done.
And i hate hearing ""life will get better"" ""you can do this"" do that do this... I cant.. I tried... People are nice to me when they remember i have depression. They just do it so they feel ok. I hate when people care for me so that they think they have done something. I just dont trust anyone. I just wanted to let things out. Since today was pretty rough. I was an idiot in the argument.

After three years the thoughts are back,"From age 15 to my suicide attempt at age 20 I had the same thoughts every day. Different ways to kill myself. It became normal to me. I thought maybe others did the same thing. I had a set time in my mind and if some how I didn't naturally die by this time I would do it myself. The time came and I tried. I failed. I instantly regretted it. I knew as soon as I was caught my life would never be the same and it hasn't been. I dropped out of uni. Lost 90% of my 'friends'. Got a job. Was fired. Met a guy and slowly got better. The thoughts stopped. 

Until now. The sucide ideation is back. Every day getting slightly worse. How can I reach out to people without terrifying them. They've already been through enough. Last time they didn't believe me so why will they now? For tonight I will just drink and drink until I can sleep.",SuicideWatch

Sometimes I resent my loved ones for existing because then I too have to exist.,"This is the worst thing I ever think about. It sounds terrible. I love my friends and family.

I've decided I definitely cannot ever do that to my dad. Other people love me, I'm not deluded about that. But they would get over it. My dad would never be okay, no matter how stupid I think that is, so I can't do it. 

He's young and healthy so he has at least a couple more decades left. And I'm happy for him. I want him to enjoy his retirement and all of the things he's worked so hard for. But I want to die so badly that sometimes I resent that, sometimes I resent the fact that he has so much time ahead of him because that means I have to be along for the ride. 

Distancing myself doesn't work. I haven't called him in two weeks, I live in a different city, but we've gone longer without talking and it hasn't changed anything. Sometimes I pick fights and try to get him to hate me and that doesn't work. We are really different people with different value systems so you would think it would be easy but it isn't. 

He thinks we're close and in some ways we are. I can't go to extremes with alienating my family because I truly believe my dad would figure it out. He'd know what I was doing, that it was out of character for me, he'd put it together.

There is no way -- without severely hurting innocent people -- that I can convince my family to truly hate me and not care about me at all, with no chance of redemption. Some friends, sure. But even my friendships are more resilient than I gave them credit for. I've certainly tried to ruin them in the name of saving my friends the heartache of knowing me before. And sometimes I get cold feet, and I think I need them, or I feel bad that I'm hurting them. I fade out or, on my very worst days, I snap at people, but I always apologize or come back. I know it would ultimately be better on them to not have me in their lives, but there's no way to do that without hurting them a little bit in the short term, and that's so hard to do.

So basically I'm just pushing people away and hurting them for no reason. Because I never do it *enough* to be able to act on it. I don't want to hurt anyone, but I know I am, so I'm trying to minimize that as much as possible. I don't know why I can't commit.  So I've stopped doing that. I am a polite, if distant, friend to everybody. I'm not pushing people away but I'm certainly not inviting them in. I'll let my current friends hang around, but I'm not inviting them into my inner life, I'm not letting them get any more invested in me than they already are, and I'm not making new friends. I have way too many people to let down already.

So, I'm not going to kill myself anytime soon. But I really want to. But like where do you go from here? If I called a suicide hotline or a therapist and was like ""hey I cannot stop thinking about suicide and it's the first and last thing I think about every day, and my favorite solution to every problem, and I have written and rewritten personalized notes to everyone I know, and it's truly ruining my life because it's all I can think about... but I won't act on it for at least 20 years"" they're gonna be like ""uh, call back in 20 years then."" 

There are people in the world with more emergent needs than I, and I get that. I just feel so stuck, because no matter how desperate and miserable I feel, I'm not going anywhere, so what's the point? Suicide is a problem because you *die,* and suicidal ideation is a problem because you *might die*, but if I'm confident that I won't actually die then what am I doing talking about it? What is the point? 

I considered taking a mental health day from work today, but like what would I say? I know I don't have to tell them. But what would I say to myself? I needed a day to sit around and be sad, even though I have no intention of acting on my feelings? Am I supposed to take mental health days for the next 20 years? Like, what is the point if I have no endgame? 

But I should be working right now and instead I'm sobbing and posting stuff on an alt for no reason. I don't even know why, it's just a particularly bad day, but nothing has really happened to trigger that. I had a long zoom meeting this morning and spent the whole thing writing random stream of consciousness suicidal stuff and then scribbling it out. I felt like I had to because those thoughts were going to get out, and if I didn't write them down I might say them out loud when I went to say something else. Like I had to contain them. I've been doing that a lot lately. Not just at work, I hung up on a friend the other day even though I missed him and wanted to keep talking because I was afraid I'd say something suicidey. 

This has all been incredibly fractured and incoherent and I'm very sorry to anyone who actually read it. I'm just emotionally spent and I needed to say these things to someone and it kind of just came out as word vomit.",SuicideWatch

I want to disappear,"I am 16 and I know everyone will just tell me that this is normal and teens go through this, but I don't feel like anyone should go through this. 

Sorry if my english isn't good btw. 

I don't know what to say or think right now. I need something, anything, any advice or help.

I can't describe everything thats going wrong right now, but I'll try to tell the worst things.

I have recently been having really crazy mood swings and very little energy alongside with weird eye problems. Also i have little to no interest in anything that I used to like. The mood swings are weird, they can come up at any moment, even if I am having a great time. Just a sudden feeling of emptiness and realization that everything is and will always be worthless.

So today I fell off my motorcycle/moped(don't know what others refer it to as) when braking and i guess the wheels or brakes somehow locked and the concequences are bad. I bruises my left shoulder, arm and knee pretty badly. I had recently made some adjustments to my moped with my friend that insurance wont like and neither does my dad. I now have to revert it back to normal and I don't even know how to do that. The mopeds steering thing got bent and it also received minor bruices on the paint. 

Some consequences also include:
I am terrified of driving ever again. 

I feel anxious and I am just in a constant state of fear. 

I can't go to the gym because it hurts to do any physical activity or exercise.

I don't have a way to make it to my summer job. I have to have a moped with me there, which i may not have when i have work again and I also cant work because of my injuries.

Oh and also the job is literal hell.

My dad is really fucking pissed off.

I can't go fast anymore.

I know these may not sound so bad to you, but for a 16 year old that is not rich and doesn't have everything going perfect at the moment it is pretty bad. 
I believe that everything happens for a reason and that everyone on earth gets equal happiness in their life, but this accident made me rethink this. 

I just can't believe this could happen to me.

I just want to be gone, I don't want to be a problem for others, I don't want to experience pain anymore. I don't feel like anything is worth the pain or the lows.",SuicideWatch

Departing soon,"Hello,

I see a lot of posts on here with people explaining how external and uncontrollable factors have led them down this road. I can definitely relate but this alone isn't something that has made me contemplate suicide. 

In my own case, it is all my fault. I've let everybody down, including myself. I'm in my 30s and haven't accomplished much, infact my 20s were extremely self-destructive and I burned way too many bridges with friends and close family. There is no support system for me. I have a tendency of convincing myself that my actions are acceptable and warranted. Frankly, this couldn't be any further from the truth.

One example would be that once my mother passed away, I fled my hometown instead of supporting my father and sister. I flew to the other side of the world in a vain attempt to leave the pain I was feeling behind and it did work, for a few years. I returned home 5 years later with nothing to show for my time abroad. I drank too much, did drugs, partied like crazy. 

I don't talk about my feelings, put on a smile and pretend everything is okay because I'm scared I'll be sent to the looney bin if I open up. Lately, it has just gotten too much. I don't drink very often anymore but recently went to a family event and was extremely rude and aggressive to the host - probably has something to do with bottling my emotions instead of confronting them. I don't remember any of it but my behavior has left me with a level of self-disgust and shame that I wouldn't wish on my worse enemies. If you saw me in the street or had a conversation with me, I'd come across as a very well put together person but mentally I'm deteriorating at a very rapid rate. 

My funds have been dwindling as I've been unable to work but I am thinking of flying out to a country on the other side of the world, paying somebody to inject me with a lethal dose of opiates and fade away, then get rid of my body so nobody can find out what a coward I really am. Apologies if I've broken any of the community rules - I just feel a need to put what I'm going through into words.",SuicideWatch

"""You'll never be a real man-""","""-just.. closer to one.."" -My aunt. Friday, June 12, 12:27 pm, 2020. 

I ""came out"" to my aunt about being trans, or at least thinking I might be. She shut me down, saying I'm not allowed to bind, go on hormone blockers and everything else. She supports gay people, but not bi, trans, pan, ace, ect.. She has been putting me down for years and I can't leave here yet. 

She constantly tells me to ""just get over it"" even when my depression is eating me alive and I can barely get out of bed, let alone deal with her shit. She constantly says she's ""showing me tough love"" by forcing me to get up and do everything when I can barely stand in the shower. She tells me my intrusive thoughts are ""just thoughts"" and ""you shouldn't care able them because it's nothing"" after my therapist told her she's worried because she believes I could act on it. 

I called the hotline two days in a row and the lady answered and asked, ""Didn't you just call yesterday?"".. Maybe I should just stop calling and go through with it, I've been fantasing about it since I was 5 and yet I've been too much of a coward to pull through with it. I feel like I should but I'm scared too..

Ive got nothing,"Um so okay im a 20 year old man, ive suffered with depression since i was 14 and it meant i failed all my gcses, got kicked out if sixthform and generslly didnt look after myself.

Thing is id always had anxiety but it was always second fiddle to the depression if that makes sense? But after i got kicked out if college i got really ill with depression and was just generally shit. I eventually got a live in job near London but after two momths i had to quit because my anxiety had gotten so bad i kept having anxiety attacks. This trend happened with every subsequent job and lead to a couple homeless stints, i eventually got into a youth housing programme and in that time i was finally declared unfit for work and and put on disability payments.

Now i live alone, dont work, cant afford much in the way of fun, not that i do enjoy things anyway, have a really fucking strained relationship with my family, and have pushed all of my old friends away cause i dont have the energy to talk to them and even when i try i cant think of what to say, my anxiety has gotten to the point where i cant go outside without having an attack and my days are spent doing fuck all cause theres nothing else i can do, when i have the money i drink and the rest of the time i just sit on my phone not doing anything.

Ive been to multiple different therapists, been on multiple different medications only to have them make me worse or have no effect, ive tried alternative therapies and meditation. My anxiety has gotten too bad for me to even be able to have sex, not that ive ever enjoyed it anyway and only ever done so because both of us were extremely high or drunk. Im a fucking ugly mess with no social or life skills, no talents, interests or motivation, when i do try i fail, every single insecurity ive ever had about myself has been proven true and the only reason i dont kill myself is out of pity for my family.

"How do I thaw myself back to normal, is it possible?","At the age of 14 I became depressed, and it lasted for 6 years. My experience of it was similar to that of a density curve if I were to put on a graph. It started mild, got progressively worse until it peaked. During it's peak I had mental breakdowns near everyday and came to close to killing myself many times. With each breakdown I lost a piece of myself, and from this point on my mind started to slowly repress my feelings until I reached as close to apathy as I could come. I grew more and more apathetic, something was inflicting unending emotional and psychological pain and the only way to cope was to numb down my emotional quotient all together.

At this point I literally can not bring myself to care about anything and if I go on like this I'm going to die young from my sedentary and otherwise unhealthy lifestyle. I have no job or education, I'm simply leeching of my parents. I've never had any friends, even if I do manage to stabilize in life I'd still live a monotonous, lonely and pointless existence.

"Expecting first child 3 months ago, now left with nothing.","Background:

When I (M32) was in high school I didn't have (many) friends. I got bullied a lot. Every so often I went to sleep crying and wanting to take my life. But every time I had those thoughts I pictured my own funeral and my parents where always there and I thought to myself, next day will be better. At the end of the week I would think next week will be better, than next month, next year... Anyways it never did, although I had some good moments as well.

At the end of high school I went to uni and things were better. I had real friends. This was all new to me, and those friends didn't seem real to me, I always thought myself as a bystander, but had great times with them. At the end of uni I was together with a girl and she wanted to study a semester abroad to Zimbabwe. I went along and did some volunteer work there. After two months we broke up, she ended up seeing someone local. Back home I did not end my thesis and never got my masters degree. (I did obtain my bachelor's degree.)

Back home I got depressed and went to therapy for a few months/year. Afterwards I got my life back together.

Current story:

Four years ago I met my now ex (27F) girlfriend. She was the best thing that ever happened to me. I found a good job at that time and after a few months we bought a house together. She even convinced me to finish my thesis and so I did. I'm still so proud of myself I did this and so happy she pushed me to do this and kept me motivated to do this while both working full time.

At the end of previous year we were talking about having a child together and a few months later she was pregnant. Everything was perfect until the 13th of March (no kidding and it was a Friday, and the start of the quarantine), she called me in panic and told me she has been bleeding. We went to the doctor and took blood test, her HCG values were not good (hormone indicating you are pregnant.) After that day we went every two days to the doctor and the specialist. They did not know what to do, the values were increasing but not enough and said the unborn child would die and leave the body naturally. Anyways it did not and we decided to put it in motion chemically, but it did not work so we did it surgically. After surgery things did not improve, and they though something was still left. So they suggested chemotherapy because apparently that also has a side effect to clean the uterus. A day into the treatment she had massive stomach aches, and we divided to wait a day and see. Next day she had the same pain and we went to the hospital again. She needed to go to surgery immediately because there was an embryo stuck in here fallopian tube, apparently it was a twin. If they did not remove it immediately, or if we waited longer she would have died. Surgery went ok, but we had some post surgery issues...

Anyways during that period I tried to stay positive the best I could but she was broken and so was I. Because of Covid we could do nothing. I couldn't even be with here in the hospital, I would not see doctors, I was helpless. We had no escape, only ourselves at home.

Shortly after we broke up.

But now she has someone new. I friend I know from sport club. We play together often and I see him multiple times a week (in non covid timeline.) Now I feel left out and don't even know what to do or say if I would see them together. No one from the sports club even knows...

And now I just want two things:

I want to go to sleep, just be in an endless peaceful sleep, I'm just so tired pretending everything is fine... A few months ago I was still thinking I would be a dad, now I'm left with nothing.

Or I just want to lie in bed with someone behind me saying everything will be fine. Someone I can completely trust again and hoping I will be together with that person forever. But I went through some much already and I just so tired always pretending I'll be ok.

"Self worth, guilt, addiction no future","Hi, I just wrote alot but it was not saved. So I am doing this again in a shorter version. Maybe I should just list my issues instead of an essay which I just did but was not saved:
28 old male from scandinavia
Brother is mentally ill, same as me, but has previously had anger issues which stems from my father. Even some violent episodes in the past towards my mom. Which I guess he learned from my father. These anger issues has seeped down from my father, to my bother, to me. I have not been violent though .And we have both forgiven him and love him.
I have had, or still have, body dysmorphia, to some degree. Have been very thin at some points.
I have struggled with addiction. Mainly downers such as opiates, benzo's and alcohol. 
I don't even know my own sexual orientation. I thought I did, but I do not. 
I struggle with low self worth.
Last year everything just went off the rails, I had i giant fight with my dad while I was drunk and on drugs. After calling me my brothers name a couple of times, just as a forgetful thing I guess, I snapped. Where I blamed him for not being in my life, I feel terrible about it, I trashed some of his stuff and pushed him and we even wrestled on the floor. Luckily none of us got hurt. I have apologised many times to him afterwards and he forgives me. But that's not even the worst of it. As the insecure guy I am, my cousins ex and I had a fling, she at first came a little on to me after they broke up. And then I developed feelings for her and we had a short lived fling, which I feel terrible about because I did not tell my cousin. They have now found more or less back together, I don't know how much, but I feel like a horrible human being, for having the fling in the first place. The whole thing revealed just how insecure and messed up I am. I feel terribly guilty. My cousin has forgiven me but I cannot forgive myself. I fell in love with her. Or I think I did, maybe I was just so lonely that I needed some human intimacy, and therefore went though with it. I don't even know what my sexual orientation is. Life keeps on complicating, I cannot see a future for myself. I have no energy and have had a suicide attempt last year. I think I might just od on morphine or heroin in my future, because it seems so terribly bleak. I'm sorry, this is messy. I just needed to vent. I know I'm an asshole for having a fling with my cousins ex who I lost my virginity to at 27, I know I'm an asshole for dragging people around me down because I feel so down.",SuicideWatch

I don't exactly know how I feel. Sometimes it hits me, fear. But it's myself I fear. I feel like the only thing stopping me is the thought of my grandmother. She might not make it if I finally get the courage to listen to my impulses.

My wife constantly tells me how miserable she is.  Professionally, I'm coasting. I meet the minimum requirements and wow nobody - I get mediocre reviews (which are deserved) which are adequate to keep the government job in which I thought I'd be able to make a positive contribution to the world.  

I have moderate confidence that the benefits to society of me dying are stronger than the benefits of me being alive. My wife and kid would benefit from a large life insurance payout and be able to move closer to family.  My kid is young enough that he'd probably not remember me anyway and be able to love a stepdad. My wife has been miserable since we had a kid - not sure whether me being dead would make much of a difference. My death would free up a job for someone who needs it who would probably be able to use it to do something positive for the world. It would have a negative impact on my mom and sisters. I'm not really able to estimate how strong that impact would be. 

I'm already on antidepressants - at best, they sortof make me able to resist the urge to kill myself. I've felt miserable for years. I don't see a rational basis to conclude that I'll feel better - I used to make myself believe that and I'm getting worse if anything.  I just don't see myself living another 50ish years feeling this way.

Hurt and exhausted of life (26F),"
Life has been tough, is tough and it is never getting easy.

My past is a mess, and I suffer the consequences (ptsd, depression, self harm, etc.). It haunts me.

My present is rubbish. My health is too. I suffer with chronic pain.
No friends, and unable to make them due to hyper vigilance and trust issues.
No family left, just my mom, who lives 1000miles away from me and has been  (and is) toxic.

 I still keep in touch with her just to feel a bit rooted to the world.
Just to feel something is still holding me here.

My fiancé is too good for me. I am not enough and he would be better off if I was dead.

Too much to recall and remember, and nothing good.
Too much pain. It doesn't get better.

Today my mom told me (in a friendly conversation about my physical health through the phone) that apparently she has life insurance that covers me (which I didn't know) and that she is ready for me to die whenever because life is tough and one needs to be selfish, and she is not bothered to suffer for anyone but herself.

She knows I have had a mental health crisis lately, and that I am not doing well.
She knows I self harm and have done it in the past although she pretends she doesn't know and gaslights me to tell me I don't do it.

It is too much. Today I had several plans on how to end my life, and what to write in a good bye letter.

I am too scared and coward  to act on my suicidal thoughts but this tightness in the chest doesn't go away and I cannot stop crying. 

I am not in immediate danger. Just my head keeps haunting me.

I’ve battled with depression since the age of 11 (which is when I started seeing my first therapist) and have since been trying to work with it. One of my main problems is the fact that I know people around me care for me, but I don’t care for myself. I am apart of the 2020 class that graduated this year and I know I should feel happy for myself but it’s just a realization that I am now in the real adult world, with more problems and stresses that I’ll encounter. To say the main reason I’m writing here today... I have recently come from a mercy clinic due to an ear infection. It’s nothing serious but my moms extremely sad and disappointed with me because I never bother to speak up. Hence the autism. I’m not sure what it was but the fact that she sounded so frustrated with me put me in a dark spot. The medication for this infection is extremely expensive and while we can afford it, I feel bad for my mother having to pay for all this. I’m mad at myself for allowing this to happen and for not bothering to speak up. I’m mad at myself for having autism and depression. It sucks to know that if I choose to not kill myself that I will struggle with this crap all my life. I’m sorry for making you read this and have to worry about me but I just needed to get this off my chest. Thank you though.",SuicideWatch

The problem with reaching out for help,"If you reach out to a friend, asking for help. They will probably sit and console you. Let you know that they care, and that you matter... And at the end of the conversation, you very well might feel better in the moment.

But your friend is going to think that they fixed you. They didn't. This shit is daily.

The whispers are daily. 
The reminders are daily.
The self indignation is daily.

And reaching out for help every fucking day is going to get real old, real quick. Your friends will tire. They will see that no matter what they say to you, nothing changes. 

I can't stomach the thought of forcing someone else to have to deal with me. And I know that if I reach out once, I am a lot more likely to continue leaning on that person. So I don't reach out in the first place. My peers know where my headspace is, but the notion of forcing a friend to mop of the mess in my brain every day just makes me more sad.",SuicideWatch
I (23M) feel so defeated and moving forward seems too hard.,"Hey, so 2020 has been a crazy year (as we have all seen). I've been struggling to cope with all the things that have happened this year combined with my 'normal' mental health issues. The other day I had a trigger that pulled me out of the void of ignorance. Since this, I've been feeling a lot of intense feelings and like everything has finally caught up to me.

I spent some time the other day frozen in this internalized state of mind, like I was stuck inside my mind. During this I just decided to set a date for killing myself. I don't know if it will happen. I gave myself an out just in case.

Anyway, those events I have been so vague about happening? Well, let us get started! First things first, housing. For the last few months I've been squatting (paying a little bit to my roommate) to stay in the spare room of her apartment. Then the other day, the door to my room was locked during an inspection (I had to empty the room and hide my stuff) and in this complex, you're only given a key for the front door and specific room you are staying in. So now I'm moving back in with my mom. The issue here; however, is my mom is still living with her ex-boyfriend as she struggles to find a house she can afford (150k range in PA but can't find anything that looks like it could be her last house as she is now almost 60). So, I'm going to moving in there. The ex doesn't seem to mind me but we butt heads politically and morally. So, I've just been feeling a lot of shame over not having a place and having to rely on the support of others who are not so willing.

Back in Feb. my now ex-gf's dad died. I was there for it all. I did everything I could to be supportive and it was hard as the ex was obviously and understandably distraught. A lot of days without talking and being yelled out occurred until she ended the relationship a couple months later. This as a whole was rough but I could've handled it if not for the fact that...

During all this time, I had put hours into applying for a position after graduation and was doing testing, background checks, and such for it only to be told 'no' because I smoked pot 10 months prior. I was rejected the day before the breakup.

Also during all of this, I fell behind in coursework and currently still have incompletes on my transcript and have not officially graduated.

So, I currently have very little money, have not finished college, have been losing friends (over voicing my support for the current movement and from being both emotionally distant from the stress and physically distant due to coronavirus).

I know what needs to be done to finish everything up and get back on track but I've lost the energy to do so. The past two years of college, I had started to regret my major and only continued so I could get out of college instead of spending more time and money on a different major.

Everything just feels too much lately. I know it's really not but I cannot, again, find any motivation to continue.

I watched my mother suffer my whole life, I'm scared the same will be me.

I am a monster. (WARNING: This is probably the most disturbing thing you will ever read.),"This has been a long time coming. I am, without a shadow of a doubt, one of the most sick, twisted, malicious, and evil people to be walking around the planet. My thoughts and fantasies, intrusive or not, are incredibly disturbing. But my actions and the numerous crimes I've committed this past decade are even more sickening. I was born with what I call a ""delayed sense of morality."" Meaning, I only perceived things as ""good"" or ""bad"" based on the perceives consequences rendered onto *myself*, and not how they affect others. This led me to acting like the ""good kid"", but only to advance my own goals and others perception of me. I was raised in an extremely dysfunctional home with my parents fighting every single night. Up until very recently, I had virtually zero altruistic qualities. With that in mind, lets begin confessing the depths of my depravity. I am a horrible, wretched individual.

By Age 7, I had already:

\-Stolen another person's poem and won a poetry contest with it.

\-Lied to my parents about ""inventing"" great things.

\-Beaten and bullied many of my friends, including tormenting an autistic girl with one of my friends.

\-Shoplifted

\-Abused my first cat by squeezing him until he meowed and threw him down the stairs, as well as hitting him (I did this with another cat as well).

\-Picked up and hurled my cousin over the trampoline net

\-Lied to my mother and deleted her emails when I got in trouble.

\-Faked being sick

\-Flashed myself at my friends (I got in MASSIVE trouble for that).

\-Refused to work with an Indian girl because ""she was brown.""

\-Almost had sex with my own sister. Mostly sibling experimentation.

When I left elementary school and entered middle school, at 11, the attacks to my narcissistic ego made me even worse. It was also around this time I discovered porn. I remember one of the first fantasies I had was the girl I bullied entering my room, nude, and mounting me. This was the start of a long period of sexual deviancy. My grandfather's death when I was 12 made me develop a new coping mechanism to reception of pain: Dissociation and numbing. When something bad happens, my brain numbs it immediately and I become unmoved by it. This mechanism defined my ability to commit increasingly vile actions over time, as well as normalize twisted thoughts. I also developed a bad temper as initially a means to control and intimidate others, but over time, it became genuine. Here are the LONG list of absolutely depraved and sickening things I've thought or done. I'm getting a black pit of shame in my stomach as I'm typing this.

\-Slandered a girl I had a crush on's name because I was afraid she'd reject me. I sent my jock prep friends to bully her over social media. I stalked her for a period of three plus years. I never made any contact but I did drive around her town several times to see if I could find her. My intentions were not to harm but to simply reconnect. I also helped a friend of mine stalk an ""ex"" of his.

\-Psychologically and emotionally abused my first ""girlfriend"" (it was online, we never actually met up but we did have each other's phone numbers) by faking being in life threatening situations. I got off her emotional distress and it made me feel ""in control."" When I was done with my ""puppet"", as I named her, I just lied about changing numbers and cut all contact.

\-Got into extremely volatile fights with my family members. Some of them have resulted in injuries. We threw knives and other weapons at each other. I once got pepper sprayed by my own sister for throwing a metal shovel and it landing in the wall. My mother and father alike have broken and destroyed stuff around the house. We all possess violent tempers.

\-In high school, I became lazy and did not want to do any work. My mother, a nervous wreck, asked me why and I lied to her and spun a web of deceit, resulting in explosive fights, all over my fear of telling the truth.

\-I beat up someone in high school for simply being ""annoying.""

\-I drew out elaborate plans to fake my own death. At the beginning of senior year in high school, I felt as though I was dealt an unfair hand in life and wanted to start anew elsewhere. I had an elaborate plan to drive my car off a bridge, blow it up, but bail before I was caught in the explosion. The disgusting part is that I also wanted to get off to people crying over me.

\-I attempted satanic rituals and was a heavy blasphemer. I wanted to get possessed and tried praying to lucifer for a natural disaster. One did happen, approximately a week later, but killed no one. I have tried to attempt other supernatural rituals

\-I was an extreme sexual deviant and coomer with a masturbation addiction going on for almost a decade. I masturbated \*daily\* I had developed every disgusting and vile sexual fetish you can conceptualize. I was a bi-incest-biasto-sadistic-zoo-paedo-necrophile. Growing up, I sexually experimented with my male cousin for almost a year. I was 13, and he was 12. Although he initiated first, by the end, I was in control. We did everything you can think of besides literal anal sex. I watched extreme bestiality videos of animals fucking each other, and humans. My obsession knew no boundaries and I attempted to fuck my cat in the ass on several occasions. I also attempted to spy on my sister on several occasions, mainly in the shower. This was due to an obsession over the aforementioned childhood sexual experience with her. Eventually, normal porn wasn't giving me the rush I needed for masturbation. I got into hentai, tentacle porn, drawn and animated bestiality, loli and shota. I used to take quick glances down the shirts of girls as young as three. Eventually, even that wasn't enough. I got into rape and child porn, and masturbated to those things. Never downloaded, distributed, or made it, I just saw pictures. The pics ranged from everything from teenagers, to models, to literal toddler rape. I stopped though at some point and reported every single website I saw, as well as the means to access them. As for my fantasies, they were so depraved and disturbing that I felt as though my soul was rotted, some of them involved corpses, infants, and foetuses. I have never actually sexually assaulted another human being before. I lost my virginity at 19 years of age to my friends trans asian girlfriend while they were together. She cheated on him with me in this manner twice.

\-I developed murder fantasies and obsessions for most of my time growing up. I became obsessed with horror movies and imagined myself as the killer, inspiring fear in other people. I purchased a $300 scream costume, and buck 120, and would carry it around in my bad for ""emergencies."" I showed people images of gore, impalement, and dead bodies. I spent quite a lot of time in the guidance office because of it. At one point I was so obsessed I began dreaming of indiscriminately murdering anyone and everyone, from infants to the elderly. I threatened my cousins with an ax, chased them around with knives and even cut open a dead squirrel my cat brought home to ""immerse myself."" I also threatened to kill my immediate family members several times. Despite this, I have seen (and jerked off to) several videos of murder including One Lunatic One Icepick, ISIL beheading videos, Three Guys one hammer, etc (no, I did not download or share them). Despite all this, I never actually followed through and killed anyone though, mostly due to the fact that I knew it was something you couldn't turn back from.

I want to make it abundantly clear that I no longer do \*\*\*any\*\*\* of these things and hold extreme shame, guilt, and remorse over them. I've always hated myself, but now my obsession with my dark past has led to suicidal feelings and relentless self-condemnation. The sick, twisted thoughts re-emerged as a result of my recent obsession with my misdeeds, but this time they're intrusive. I had an anxiety attack over one of them recently. My brain told me ""You should kill yourself right now"" and ""You're an abomination."" It plagued me all day at work. I don't want to be beyond redemption. I got tired of spreading so much misery and victimizing others. I've confided in friends about my horrible conduct and their willingness to stay with me has given me a newfound appreciation for life that I previously didn't have. I've thought about going to therapy and asking for ways to handle the great deal of emotional pain that comes with remorse, as well as trying to re-sensitize myself. I know somewhere in my blackened heart there's empathy, but I don't allow myself to feel it because I fear I ""won't survive it"" if that makes sense. I fear the pain will be too much to bear. I don't want to be a monster anymore.",SuicideWatch

I'm suicidial and I don't think that'll ever change,"I've been depressed since I was a child. My mother told me the other day that she took me to doctors for my depression when i was a child and they told her she was being paranoid or that ""you'd be depressed too if you'd lost the people she has"". I never got better. I started hurting myself when i got upset as a child too, and from the ages of 14-19 regurally self harmed. I'm still suicidial and depressed, but I'm also covered in scars now too. I'm on medication and I realized that I stayed up past my bedtime last night to watch Netflix and I was pathetically proud of myself for actually wanting to do soemthing for once in my life. I was proud of myself for watching tv, which is definitely pathetic. And no matter what i do, I'm still suicidial and I'm still depressed. I want this to stop and i know it never will. I'll never be normal or happy. I'm not going to kill myself until my mother dies because I don't want to do that to her, but she's chronically, severely I'll all the time amd growing up i never even expected her to love this long so who knows when she'll go Once she dies, I'm going to spend the rest of my money going on a road trip, skydiving, that sort of thing. And once I run out of savings, I'll kill myself. I already know how I'll do it. The only question left I guess is when. I'm terrified there's nothing after death, but at least nothing is better than misery. Sorry for ranting, i just wanted to let this out i guess.",SuicideWatch
Problems with people who tries to stop suicide attempt,"Ignorance, hypocritical

This is based on my experience and observation, not necessarily applies to all cases. 

This is for the ignorants. Most suicidal people do not give a damn about what they are going to leave on earth. Talk about materialistic value (possession, job, status quo) that the person has achieved or could achieve, you will give nothing but a feeling of disgust accompanied with intensified repulsive view on the world from the suicidal's perspective. The only things that add up to their consideration are their emotional connection to the close one and the very consequence after death itself TO THEM, not to what they are going to leave on earth. Even some are willing to cut these emotional attachment. 

Religion and sugarcoat advice will go over their head. They have seen, experienced, endure the rough part of life and had enough of it. Speak about the possible opportunity and future, they will not buy it. They have realized that it will be nothing but a momentary break before the suicidal thought strikes back. Most won't even bother to work for it, simply because it doesn't matter to them. Regarding to advice of taking medical treatment and therapy, most have taken these long before, comes to no avail. Some won't even bother. As an additional insight, in most third world country the concept of mental therapy is highly unfamiliar except for those who have the privilege of possessing above average level of wealth. 

This is for the hypocrites. Usually this is experienced by a suicidal with a still functioning social life. Take this example, or perhaps try it yourself. No one will give a damn about you until out of sudden you starts to give everyone a depressed look. Then when being asked about it, pour the magic ""I'll end my life in a week or two"" sentence. Now you are a king among your inner circle. Suddenly your parents indulge you, appreciate your achievement that they used to not give a shit about. Your friends become pseudo saint in front of you. People you barely know starts to act as if they are your longtime friend. Strangers on the internet suddenly love you. Then you recover, start to have the will to live. Bet my ass, they'll drop their act as soon as you drop yours. Ironic isn't it? Death attracts compassion, will to live attracts assholes. 

If you really do care and want to help instead of exposing your superiority complex to the desperados, simply LISTEN and try to understand. That is more than enough. If you want to give advice, make sure you understand his standpoint, the problem, your standpoint and last but not least, WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT. Believe me, if you have never experienced any intense prolonged pain of have had enough with everything, you could barely scratch the idea of it. If you don't really care, stay in your goddamn business instead of pretending to care only to disappoint once they have the will to live. 

And oh don't get me started on the idea of arguing. Argue with the suicidal person about why they should not commit suicide will do them a favor of convincing them even more to take their life.

My two cents:
Open their mind, NOT direct;
Listen and understand, NOT lecture.

Who do I go to?,"When I was in 5th grade I started going to therapy for a few reasons the main ones being sexual. I got diagnosed with adhd and started taking meds everyday. For a while they were way to strong and I didn’t have any emotions at all. I continues going to my psychiatrist for about a year and a half. I’m 8th grade my older sister and here boyfriend went to college. They were some of my best friends at the time and both still are. But with them being gone I got super depressed. I talked to my dad about it and we decided to remove anything I could harm myself with easily; like knives and scissors, from our house and locked them in our garage. 

I told my parents I wanted to go back to my psychiatrist. I went to here bi weekly for about 8 months. My parents didn’t think anything was coming from it and with it being fairly expensive I stopped my freshman year of high school. I continued to take the same medication this entire time. I never talked to my parents about being depressed or wanting to kill myself again after that night in 8th grade. It mad them so sad that I felt that way that I wanted them to think everything is okay so they don’t have to worry.

I am 22 now and I’m still depressed all the time. Over the last year I’ve been very suicidal. I think about death all the time. At work, with my friends, with my family, etc. I have really bad social anxiety. I get super nervous and hide under my sweatshirt hood 24/7. 

I am in school and still to this day am taking adhd meds but I don’t think it helps with anything other than school work. When I’m on it I get things done fast and efficient but my depression and thoughts of suicide are constantly on my mind. The last time I was at the doctor I told them everything was fine when it wasn’t because I can’t pass any of my classes without my meds. 

I want to talk to someone about seeing a psychiatrist again  it I don’t know how to bring this up to my family cause the second I tell them I’ve been suicidal this whole time I think they will be mad that I haven’t told them this whole time.

I don't get along with my aunt, I don't wanna see her around the baby because she's toxic af. I just don't wanna be around her. So I told my grandpa that if he wants to come to MY house to see the baby, he can't bring my aunt with him.

He told me I was disrespectful to my family member's legacy, that he would have wanted me to be better and more polite.
That hurt like hell. Since he passed away , I have DONE EVERYTHING IN MY POWER to be respectful to his memory. To let EVERYONE see the baby , but my aunt posted pictures of the baby online when the mother said not to. She WAS DISRESPECTFUL, she was the one who was rude.
And he said that my depression had no reason to be, that I'm a crybaby and other shit.
AFTER THAT, he called my mama and said shit to her . He made her cry.
My mom of course put the blame on me. Because she doesn't know what her father said to me.
I'm not okay . I have done everything in my power to be better, to not let the mourning consume me, when every second I wish I had been killed instead of my family member . To have been at the wrong moment and  place , just so my nephew could have a father.

I think I have a plan,"I work near a lake with a boardwalk. there's a bridge (about 20 feet above the water) that you have to climb up and cross to get to the other side of the boardwalk.

I climbed it on my lunch break today. I can't swim, so if I jumped into the lake during a slow time, I would almost certainly drown before anyone could get to me (assuming anyone spots me).

I couldn't today because there were people around. but if I go back early on Monday morning, I might be alone, and then I could do it.

on the boardwalk, I saw groups of friends, families, a bride and groom getting wedding photos taken. these are things I won't ever experience myself. things I used to want very much. it made me feel more certain that this is the right choice for me.

-Covid is making all my future dreams go farther away due to isolation and societys changes
-Im getting short in $$$ and have no clue what to do as im stuck in this old ghosttown with few job prospects

"Suicidal GF, I feel like I've ran out of options to help","My GF is having a rough go of it. Shes had chronic pelvic pain for ~3 years following a rape and follow-on promiscuity in attempts to cope. Around February this year the pain kicked into overdrive due to a reaction from a medicine. She has been dealing with urinary frequency and retention at times along with general horrific muscular pain. Weve gone to a million doctors and have finally found a support team full of some top notch individuals. (She has Pelvic Floor Dysfunction and PFD induced interstitial cystitis along with extreme sensitivities to side effects from medication) Her primary care dr, OBGYN, Physical Therapist, accupuncturist, Phycotherapist, and Hypnotherapist have really ushered some progression in since April which is great. 

Sadly, the pain is still around, albiet, less than in Feb but its still not great. Recently, due to an increase in pain and sleeplessness, shes having 2 to 3 panic attacks each day and starting to really concern me about suicide again as weve started talking about that daily during the panic attacks. All the Drs. and therapists are aware of all the details and are working with her on it. We just started her on an SSRI that shouldnt cause any urinary retention but we have to wait for it to kick in.. and if she has any urinary symptoms during this time, i fear it may be falsely correlated with the SSRI. Which then she would want to stop taking...

In all honesty this whole situation scares me because am always concerned about her well being when im sleeping or at work. I feel like i spend almost all of my time in the day trying to keep her alive. Im fighting a battle of my own trying not to lose hope and trying to find ways to keep her mental in a good state through her pain. I really just dont know where to go from here. She wants immediate relief, which i cant blame her for, but I dont know how to provide it. Or even find someone who could at this point. Im scared that she may actually attempt suicide, and im at the point where i want to start hiding things from her (some drugs that she doesnt need that she can OD on are already hidden). I know that isnt the right answer, even hiding the drugs. Im just at a loss now. And i dont know how many more times I can take her on walks and calm her down. That tactic has been working but its not a long term solution. None of this is. I just dont know what to do next to keep her alive. What do you do after youve gotten someone what feels like all the support and they still want to leave the earth?

We ended up having to move to a different state, my dad met my stepmom who was pregnant with a little girl, right away she didn't like me, always told me to eat more, said i was ugly for the way i dressed, would never fully address me just call me girl or the other one, and would hardly celebrate my birthday, they got married and we moved back to the same state as my birth mom who then stalked and threatened to kidnap me and my siblings, it got so bad and lasted so long that 2 different schools had to have special procedures in case she showed up, my step mom started abusing me it got so bad i started to have to wear makeup in 6th-7th grade until my dad told her to stop, she didnt of course she just hits in less visible places when she did i stopped wearing makeup since i had no purpose for it and she would call me a tranny or a dyke. she always tells my little sister that i'm a whore and thief even tho she is 8 years younger then me. i then came out as bi and now nobody talks to me unless it is to get onto me. my older brother even got his girlfriend to spread a rumor about how i am in love with her and when i got mad at him for not standing up for me he slammed me into a door and started hitting me telling me to stop being such a predator. i have to stay home all day and clean up after everyone else and babysit my sister all day, cook, and take care of our dog and if i do anything wrong i am punished far worse than anyone else. i can't wait to graduate but my stepmom keeps guilt tripping me by saying i'm just going to abandoned them and ruin their lives. my dad works sm that he is hardly home, but even when he is he cant look at me because he knows im bi, i've asked to go to a therapist for my suicidal thoughts but he said we can't afford it, yet my little sister is on 2 different soccer teams, dance team, swim, gymnastics, and goes to a daycare that cost $500 a month. and i can't have a job or drive bc they need me to babysit even when they are both home. i feel nothing but i have hope that one day things will be ok, but then i hear all these stories about how it just isn't worth it and wonder if i should just do the world a favour and off myself rn. for reference i am a 16 year old female. around my friends i am described as funny, chill, and bubbly, but at home i become a different person entirely and i am just so fucking stuck and i feel nothing all i think about is either the next time i get to leave this fucking house or killing myself. please anything helps. anything. thank you for reading i am sorry it is so long.",SuicideWatch

Idk what it's like to be a part of society,"I never accomplished anything in my life. There is nothing to my name. I don't have a future. And my health is getting even worse. Before, it was only my feet that would turn black and blue with white toenails out of nowhere. But now it's getting to my hands, too. And I've got that dumb cyst in my right hand, which makes drawing even more difficult. I can't even stand upright, cause my feet, neck and spine are too weak to carry me. I probably won't be able to go to school again. I can't even buy groceries on my own. Or do anything, really. Even just talking, and touching things hurts my body.              

 Idk how I'm supposed to integrate into this world, if I can't even use my body to live. Having any sort of relationship sounds exhausting. I'm not even a good person to be around. Nobody wants to talk to me anyways, so. I really just want to draw more. Idk what else I will do. I don't even know if my health is going to get worse to the point of death. Maybe I'm just being a bit of a hypochondriac. But then again, I did almost die from a rare disease at 15. Guess my health was never really good to begin with.                

Doctors don't really care about me, maybe cause my family's poor, maybe because they don't want to look deeper into it, who knows. I honestly don't want anyone to remember me after I die. What's the point? With the way that I ended up presenting myself, I'd rather want all those memories erased from this world forever. I didn't even get to live a somewhat peaceful and authentic life until recently. Everything before that was kind of a waste, really.        

It wasn't who I wanted to be, or should have been, and thinking about those times makes my toes curl. And I also hate getting flashbacks of an old man calling me onto his lap, while my mom defends him in court. I'm not saying this for the pity party, I really just don't want any more of those kinds of memories. I wanted to learn french or italian, but there's no room in my head for that, if everything's full of abuse. I wish I could be an android, then time would me mine, and I could simply delete everything that I don't need. Or block it at least, idk. Also, I don't like sleep anymore. I wish I never had to sleep again. I would have even more time, then.             

If I can't even life on my own, and if I don't know how to integrate into this society, then what's the point? I'm useless. But yeah, life's my responsibility.

Advice,"Hey everyone, this my first time ever posting on Reddit so forgive me if it doesn't look up to scratch. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am not sure if everyone has these thoughts, maybe everyone wishes they weren't here on the inside. Either way, I am looking for advice. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been thinking about suicide for a year now and I need it to stop. I feel this way because of school mainly, my mum is a doctor so obviously there is lots of academic pressure, she got 12 As in her GCSEs and 4 A\* in A levels and I often think to myself that there is no way I can possibly live up to her in any way, this resulted in me putting myself under lots of pressure to succeed in exams, often not letting myself eat if I got below a C, and to be fair to myself, I did see results, but at the cost of my mental health.

Furthermore, my house doesn't have any farther figure because he left a few years ago to start a new life in Australia and after reading the studies I concluded that this plays a large part in these feelings. School feels as tho it is slowly eating away at me. My school utilizes the cruel practice of 'streaming' which is the idea that students should be grouped tother based on academic performance, with little regard for the well-being of the students who will be labeled as at the 'bottom'. It is hard to be motivated to wake up 5 days a week to go to school, knowing that you are at the bottom. A dunce. 

In a world where anyone can be anything, it seems diabolical that such a dystopian system can be put into practice while being unscrutinized. The schooling system in the U.K is not only cruel but dehumanizing particularly to those who may under-perform. 

As many may know, right now is exam season in the U.K, which has led to me having these dark thoughts in record numbers, and I am scared that one day, I might just crack under the pressure and end it all. But at least for now, I recognize that it would be a foolish thing to do.

If I am complaining about nothing (Which there is a high chance I am), just tell me to stop complaining and shut the f\*\*\* up. But I still need advice on how I can exit this dead-end of destructive thoughts and mannerisms before its to late to turn back. 

My final thought concludes that we all have people and things to live for, amazing memories that deserve to be remembered for years to come and new experiences that no matter your current situation, will happen one day soon. We just need to be reminded of that sometimes. Which is why I turn to you.

Being alive is hell,"But dying... I feel like I will be copping out without trying to figure out all the life shit first.

I'm in an abusive not-marraige, I can't tell anyone what's happening to me or they'd try to help and make it worse. 

My kids have to deal with me being absent mentally and barely functional because of whats happening... And a long history of C-PTSD and depression on my end.

I love my children so much. I hide all this from them, they are too little and it would damage them immensely to know what was really happening.

I didn't want kids, not when I had them. I knew it was too soon...

But I didn't have the courage to abort. (Hyper religious upbringing). Not til way later, twice, after any inkling of religion was pounded out of me.

You can only deal with what I have for so long before God either becomes an enemy, or a sad fairy tale told to the foolish and naive.

And I would think that it was temporary... Except this has gone on in some form my entire life. It's unspeakable. I will never, never get justice for what has been done... I can barely speak about it in even the most general terms.

"This is it. It’s never going to stop, it’s never going to get better, nobody is coming to help, and I’m an asshole for ever complaining.","It just isn’t.

Daycare hasn’t reopened and has no plans to reopen, but is still charging $75 a week to *not* teach or watch any kids.  

Spouse isn’t going to take any time off of work to give me even a one-hour break, and is going back to the office the *second* it reopens.  “I need this,” they told me.  “It’s for my mental health.  I just can’t stay at this house any longer.”

Looking for work is still impossible because there is no one to take care of the kid, and Spouse continues to sabotage the job search.  “Of course I can watch the kid” so I can do an interview becomes “I have a meeting” ten minutes before the call is scheduled.  Actual interviews get interrupted when the router “accidentally” gets turned off mid-call.  Recruiters who went to the same schools Spouse did *somehow* stop answering their phones or emails after alumni events I know Spouse attended. I am expected to believe a toddler somehow climbed into the closet and poured paint all over my interview suits in the closet while I was at the grocery store. 

Watching the kid isn’t going to get any easier.  Months and months and months of tantrums, of failed potty training, of screaming sleepless nights, of being called too fat and stupid to parent by everyone at the pediatrician’s office, of being coughed and sneezed and pissed and shat on, of having meals I prepared rejected and thrown across the room by two stupid assholes (only one of whom has the excuse of being under three) who refuse to eat it or anything else but complain that they’re still hungry.  No daycare, no breaks.  24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

And I ever complain about this, to anyone I know?  Then they remind me that I’m the asshole for complaining.  Because I don’t have a job.  Because I’m a leech.  Because I’m a breeder.  Because I don’t have enough kids.  Because I don’t like being a parent.  Because I don’t know how easy I have it. Because they have it worse.  Because other people have it worse.  

And Spouse hears about it all, and makes sure I hear it back.

EDIT: Hey mods, why can’t I say anything in my own defense without you removing my comments?

I see the mods have removed me standing up for myself in the face of an admitted troll, so here’s my takeaway.

Just ... the sheer *gall* it takes to read about four discrete instances of Spouse sabotaging my attempts to find literally any job—to the point where they poured paint over my interview suits and blamed it on a toddler who did not have access to any paint and could not have climbed that high in the closet—and then turn around and *take Spouse’s side* and call it “tough love” and then constantly demonstrate exactly the kind of abuse I get whenever I try to open up about my life and my feelings ...

I can't do this anymore,"Hey Reddit. I'm not sure if anyone will read this but I just have to tell someone. I'm so done with life. This will probably be a long post. Basically, I was born with a drug addiction. My parents were both junkies. My father died when I was 6 months old so I never really knew him. My mother had some abusive boyfriends but that's not what I'm talking about. She was in rehab a few times and it worked... A few times. I'm pretty sure she had borderline personality disorder but it's hard to say because that could've also been the drugs. One time she was happy and dancing on the street and traveling and cooking and other times she was empty, didn't leave her bed, didn't eat did nothing. She always screamed at me. But I loved her anyways. I loved her till the day she died. I just turned 12 and didn't have real friends. She was the only thing in the world that I had and that I loved. I often was more mother than she was. She slit her wrist and took meth. It's not clear why she died exactly, could've been blood loss or an overdose. My world shattered in pieces. It broke my heart and I never came over it. I'm almost 17,turning in a week. I'm in love, I think. But even if she liked me back, I'd just panic. I have strong abandonment and commitment issues and I think I'm a narcissist. I'm a diagnosed bipolar and have to repeat the school year because I was rarely there this year.

my(30m) ex(27f) is suicidal,"a few months ago my ex started talking with a guy online while we were still together and i told her how this really bothered me and to please cut him out.  soon after this she broke up with me, and has been spending more and more time with this specific guy online and flirting (I can tell because she streams on twitchtv).  i found this to be an incredibly painful thing for her to do during this breakup.

she has felt suicidal feelings for years and last night she told me she has a concrete plan to commit the deed, after she pays back some debts to me from when we were dating, and sorts out other things.  she said she still has feelings for me but does not want to try and fix things between us.

she said the guy online that came between us does not mean much to her, and yet she has not taken action to show this, such as cutting him out of her life in any way.  she does not owe me this  because she has broken up with me, but by her actions of keeping him in her life, i cannot help but see this as a huge fuck you and just a barrier in general.  i am incredibly hurt by this.

she says nothing but her brother is important to her, but that her pets and I are still more important than this other guy.

i still love her, and yet i hold bitterness and resentment around the circumstances of our split.  i would be devastated if she ended her life.  should i try to bury my pain and let it take a backseat to the looming dragon of her suicidal intentions?  she has clearly reached out to me about suicide.  i need some perspective on how i can best support my exgf through these trying times.",SuicideWatch

And if they are, then things should’ve gotten better sooner but at this point I’ve given up and I don’t care.

I bought pills today,"Didn’t bother to research if it would be enough to do the job until after the fact, of course turns out it wouldn’t be, although maybe it would if I took them with some other pills I have. I’ve had suicidal thoughts before but I’ve never gone as far as to purchase something with that being the intended use. But I’m so numb from depression and over-stressing that it doesn’t even scare me.

I really don’t know what else to do though. I’m finally in love with someone who loves me back, and I don’t know if we could ever be together or if I’ll ever see them again. Everyone thinks I’m about to graduate when in all likelihood I’m going to fail this semester; due to the global situation it would be easier for me to make up for it and maybe graduate next semester or next year, but I still would probably graduate with shitty grades and have to move back to my home country, at least for a while, which I really don’t want do. Plus, I know how disappointed my family will be when I tell them. They all think I’m doing so well and I’m not.

I feel like I’ve ruined my life and I’ll accomplish nothing. I’m not worthy of being with my love, or receiving love from anyone. Part of me wants to end it before I disappoint anyone further. But I know that if I do, I’d hurt several people, at least one of which I’m pretty certain would kill themselves too, or at least try. I’m also afraid of failing and permanently damaging myself, or at least being in a lot of physical pain.

I finish my degree on Friday and I think I’m gonna OD,"For the last 5 months my anxiety has been horrendous. I feel like I’ve been inside my own head almost the whole time- until about a month ago I was convincing myself on almost a daily basis that various friends didn’t want to be friends with me any more and I wouldn’t say that it’s technically got better but I’ve had so much uni work the last 3-4 weeks it’s like I haven’t been able to think about anything else and my brain’s sort of gone into this anxious detached mindset since then which has kind of numbed everything out apart from work.

I just think carrying on with uni this year was a mistake. About 2 months ago just before lockdown started I was really thinking of deferring this semester to next year or extending my deadlines until August but I decided to try and graduate in July and my last deadline is Friday. I know even w/out work my mental health would still be bad - I’ve just had a lot to process mentally this year outside of COVID and then everything happening in the US definitely heightened / is heightening my anxiety but I know it would’ve still been bad without work. I just don’t know what I’ve carried on working for. Yes like I’ll graduate in July but I’ve basically not spoken to any of my friends for a month and things were already bad before bc of my mental health and now what like I’m gonna graduate and what for - I have so much mental health shit to work through after I’m done w uni, I haven’t sorted out where I’m going to live or work after uni and at this point my brain can’t even work out which of my friends it would be appropriate to ask about living situations bc I haven’t spoken to anyone in so long. It feels like working this hard the last month has irreparably fucked my brain even more than it was before and like what is the point of living. Like why tell someone they need to live when they might not. I know some people may be sad if I died but I think I’ve lowered peoples expectations of me enough that they’d get over it soon - I feel like I’ve distanced myself enough (unintentionally but still) so like objectively no one would care and it’s not their fault. I just don’t think I was meant to be here so like I should quit while I’m ahead.",SuicideWatch
I'm done. I can't cope with rejection and loneliness anymore,"I know people are probably not going to care to read all of this but I need to get it off my chest.  


I've never really experienced love in my life. I don't just mean romantic love but also family an friend. I've had glimpses of it but it always ended up with rejection, emotional neglect, or abuse etc. I know some of it is my fault in the last several years because I lost hope in love actually existing for someone like me and therefor I either stop trying or run away but the last couple of times I really tried my hardest to be open I just get rejected/abandoned or emotionally neglected. I can't even describe how deep the hurt is at this point but it's unbearable.   


My parents were very distant, they'd physically care for me but emotionally they were never there. The rare time they did speak to me was to say how disappointed they were, how they liked my sibling better, how I was a bad child even though I wasn't. I vividly remember cracking in the middle of the night because of bullying in school and going to my mom crying and she didn't care at all. My father has hit me, yelled in my face and just generally didn't like me because I was struggling and I'm not what they wanted. Eventually I got kicked out over nothing when I was 18. I've been estranged from my family for over a decade now, the few times I tried they took no responsibility for their actions and always blamed it on me so for my own sanity I had to remove myself from the toxicity.  


I had two close friends at different times growing up. The first ended up ditching me for new friends and the other did some horribly hurtful things, bullied me, and then ditched me for other people. I was horribly bullied in school and most of the teachers didn't care. I recently found someone I thought could be a friend but they only seem to care about themselves. The other people I met don't even care to reply to a message.   


I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety at age 16 but I remember things going as far back as I can recall. I went through years of medications and therapy with some awful doctors who didn't care or even called me weird for being different. I tried so hard to fix myself when really a lot of the damage is there because of other people.  


The people I dated ended up mostly being horrible people. I suffered extreme abuse, rape, starvation, physical violence, emotional abuse and neglect, financial abuse, isolation the whole thing. I spend several years essentially locked away and tortured at one time. I had to flee to a shelter to get out. I moved around a lot because by that point I was so unwell that there was no way for me to work and I had no help from anyone or the government so I ended up with stranger after stranger desperately trying to not become homeless. All of whom treated me horribly, even faced sexual harassment. All this is just a fraction of what I've been through but the post would get too long if I fit it all in. Either way through it all I still kept trying to keep going.  


I found out a couple years back that I actually have high functioning autism and adhd. Suddenly all my struggles were no longer because I didn't try hard enough and it made sense why I couldn't connect with people, why they'd use/abuse me, or just weren't interested. At first things started to get better because I wasn't beating myself up as much and I tried to work on things as best I could but honestly at some point it's just not enough. I can only do so much on my own.  


If your entire life you've been rejected, unwanted, unloved, neglected, and abused by literally everyone how are you supposed to constantly pull yourself back up out of impossibly hard situations and pits of despair. I'm only human, humans need love and acceptance at least to a degree to function. At some point I can't do it all on my own. I tried to love myself as much as I was able to despite everything telling me I'm worthless, I tried to be strong, I tried to better myself but I just don't see the point anymore in even trying. I've seen no results.  


All I wanted was just one person to love me truly, not for the purpose of using me, not as a second best option, not as a way to pet themselves on the back for being such a good person for helping a vulnerable person and then taking advantage of it. That's all I ever wanted, real love and respect. Something most people have in some way in their lives that I never got to experience for real.   


Videos of parents showing respect and love for their children kills me inside, seeing friends so happy with each other, seeing people in love and really be there for each other. Why am I not worthy of that? Is it because of the baggage I carry? Is it because of the autism, depression, adhd? or maybe because I'm scared to get hurt even more? It's not like I'm not trying the very hardest I can. I try to be a good person. I'm just not perfect. Other people aren't perfect either yet people don't want someone like me. They don't want the burden or challenges. Which I understand, I just wanted someone to care enough to really try despite those challenges in the same way I had to fight to even exist still.  


I've truly just given up now. I only felt like this once when I was in that particularly abusive situation. I still don't know how I stopped myself from jumping off a bridge then. I think because I still had a shred of hope that I was worthy to someone. I had to be stronger than any person should ever have to be and for what? I now feel the same way I did then. I'm done with talking about it, talking doesn't change anything and there's no action showing promise in sight. I have no motivation in changing myself any further to appeal to someone else, I'm either worth it or not and the consensus is not. I just don't have the strength left. The depth of my loneliness is staggering, the hurt from the constant rejection is mountainous. I just can't keep climbing and falling off on my own anymore. I'm done.  


Honestly, I think people would be glad to be rid of the burden I am. Maybe a couple will be sad for a minute but people will move on as they always have and I'm forgotten.

I’m so fucking tired.,"Living feels like a chore. I don’t enjoy it. I don’t enjoy talking to people, I don’t enjoy seeing, I don’t enjoy hearing, I don’t enjoy breathing. I don’t even want to get out of bed anymore. My room is a mess, I haven’t showered in weeks. 

The only time I get up is to use the restroom and do body checks, and I absolutely hate what I see. I hate the fact that I even have to live in this meat bag. There are so many scars all over my stomach, legs, and arms. I just want to feel something other than numb and sad.

I’ve lost my period, probably due to malnutrition. I’m scared of calories, yet I binge on them. My teeth are eroded from vomiting, and I take laxatives whenever I can get my hands on them. I cant express my hatred for this endless cycle.

The distractions aren’t even working anymore. Guitar and piano don’t even bring happiness. I used to have such big dreams. I wanted to be in a band, and influence people and bring them joy. How can I give what I don’t have?

I miss being little and not having a worry. I miss the peace I used to have when I would have no stress. And I’m still young. I’m still considered “little.” I’m only 13. Thirteen. 

I’m so tired. I want this to end.",SuicideWatch

I don’t have any friends, never had a boyfriend or significant other, I always feel like the “other” in a social situation.

I’m not close to my family and they don’t understand what I go through. And they never try to understand my depression. I’ve been institutionalized for it before. 

I just wish I could be normal. Like I always feel like I’m struggling to keep it together. I have no one to lean on. I have no one to confide in. I feel like I can never express myself. I just wish it would all stop. I’m tired of ALL of it.

I’m losing hope that it’ll all get better. I’m convinced it won’t. I want to be normal",SuicideWatch

I hate when people tell me it's normal to lose friends,"Yes, it's true that we lose friends as we grow up, it's part of life. But most people usually gain new ones to replace what was lost.

What is not normal... Is to pretty much lose 90-95% of the people you used to call friends, either for one reason or another, and not being able to make new ones either.

Misunderstandings, unspoken words, my fault, their fault or a mix of the former two, people drifting away, having your heart stomped and shattered again and again, being treated like a child or special needs person, mostly being spoken to when they need help and so on...

That's why I don't even want a girlfriend, because if I can't make friends, how will I be able to go to the next step? No one would like to date a loser like me.

I'm someone who's easily forgettable and replaceable, it has always been like that... Not to mention the mistakes I made in the past year.

I feel that I will probably die either mostly alone or 100% alone somewhere in the future, and I don't think I can fix that...",SuicideWatch

I've never had any career success. The longest I've been in a job was in retail, and I quit after my suicide attempt. That was more than six years ago now. I've honestly just been drifting since then.

I don't have friends. I haven't since leaving college. I don't know how I'm supposed to connect to people.

Time hasn't made anything better. I've just gotten older. I'm tired of therapy that doesn't do anything. I'm tired of going through the motions.

I’m tired and sad and lost and I can’t live like this but I have to live like this because I’m a coward,"I’m not exactly suicidal. I fear death more than my pain in life, and I’m a coward. I won’t do anything.

I am trapped in my malfunctioning body (chronic fatigue, postural tachycardia, hypothyroidism, food allergies, migraines, add, I think that’s it but the list is so long I sometimes forget stuff tbh)

I used to be smart.’I went to a smart school as an elementary schooler/middle schooler/was type a. I had big plans. I saw my plans recently and cried. I’m so far from where I wanted to be and I keep messing up every opportunity handed to me. I got diagnosed with stupid medical shit but not until I had years of misdiagnoses and mystery stuff going on and teachers not believing me and stuff. I had friends who bullied me, fake friends, and me... just following them around like a puppy dog

I am trapped in an overachieving family (dad went to Harvard and West Point, mom worked her way out of poverty, siblings both went to uva, then there’s me working a dead end job). We compete and compete and compete and it’s exhausting I can’t compete with my sister over who has the “best” boyfriend, I can’t compete over who made the “best” Christmas dinner. It’s exhausting and it’s all I can do to keep my head above water. I’ve tried to tell them I can’t compete, that it’s exhausting, please please I’m

I am trapped in a relationship. I got drunk and cheated two times. Not consciously per say. He got drunk and hit me twice, one time he didn’t realize it was me and the second time he knew it was me and I hid in a closet. Both times I was scared shitless. He doesn’t believe a word I say. He did those things after I cheated so maybe my fault. I’m too much of a coward to break up with him. He’s the only one I’ve told the full extent of my conditions. I told my ex, but he left me to become a missionary and I was shattered for a year. 

I am unable to say no to people. I can’t speak up for myself. I try and the words won’t leave my mouth. I can’t voice my true opinion. 

None of my friends know my full life. I partition. Maybe out of embarrassment. I lie. Maybe out of embarrassment. Ie: younger friends? I lie about my age, can’t let them know I’m old and haven’t accomplished a thing! People ask me uncomfortable questions? I ignored them until we are no longer friends! 

I used to have dreams (writer/teacher) but I drown in brain fog and excuses and my age and inabilities and failures. Why the fuck would anyone want to read what I write? (Ps this is not an accurate representation of my writings or maybe it is because I haven’t written anything worthwhile in ages)

I can’t do this anymore I can’t I can’t but I see no way out I have no money I have no options I can’t figure out the first direction to go I don’t really know what to do

I want to reset back to factory settings but I can’t 

I’ve had therapists and they haven’t helped some blame my family some act like my conditions are fake (I promise you chronic fatigue is real I go to a fucking specialist with fucking research papers but my voice trembles and aches and instead of telling you that I will ghost you therapist mary)

I cry to God for help and I maybe hear a whisper of what to do but I ultimately do nothing, because I’m a coward. I do nothing and I am nothing and I cannot get out of this hole, I’ve been trying for years. I have a shitty psychiatrist so that’s not the answer. I’ve had therapists so that’s not the answer. There is no answer.",SuicideWatch

Stressed,"Hey, 

Lately I haven’t been able to get much sleep. Lots of thoughts keep me awake at night, but it’s mostly the sad ones that keep me awake for days. A month ago my dad was diagnosed with COVID-19, he is a medical frontline worker so it isn’t surprising. He got a CT scan done and apparently 25% of his lungs were infected. But he didn’t tell us. Next thing you know he got admitted, and now my sister has it.  So then my dad got better, and he came back from the hospital. However ever since he came back he’s been acting really hostile towards me. I don’t know why. I am the eldest of two daughters and I try all the time to work hard, to get good grades, to keep my family together, to try and be a good role model for my younger sister, to support my mother. But at the end of the day my father comes up to me and calls me useless for not eating, he says I’m an annoying brat. but when I confront him about it he says ‘i Shouldnt take these things seriously‘ and proceed to ignore me.   


I also have exams coming soon, and I cant focus properly, I am usually fine with studies but this time it’s different, this time I feel that there is no point in studying because there is no point in living life anymore. I can’t understand why I felt this way.  


ever since a year ago Ive felt this giant pressure from my parents, the pressure that I HAVE to become a doctor, the pressure that I have to get full marks and anything below that is unacceptable. Heck I’m crying just writing this sentence. i don’t know why but this pressure, combined with the teasing and names, make me suicidal and depressed. I dont know if I have depression, I’ve never seen a therapist, but I think I do. I also think I have acute anorexia and insomnia, because sometimes I’ll go days without eating and sleeping. I don’t know if I actually have these problems, but I don’t know how to analyze them. Honestly all I know is that I’m sad and want to die. I just want the misery and pain I feel from being alive to go away and disappear. I want to stop being a burden on my parents, and I want to stop being a burden on the world.",SuicideWatch
My Very Existence Is Wrong,"My parents have always treated me like I don’t exist whenever I cry. My mom walked in on me beating myself up and didn’t even say anything. She saw my self harm scars yeaaars ago when I was still a kid and said “you’re such a freak”. When I attempted suicide 2 years ago, they agreed to bring me to a therapist. But they still don’t understand why I’m depressed, they said they already provided me with everything and I’m ungrateful. They shame me for keep seeing my therapist bcs it costs a lot. Its their favorite weapon. “Why did u buy that? Your therapy this month already costed us 300$”. Maybe it is all just in my head, maybe I am just ungrateful. I don’t know anymore. I hurt myself because it reminds me of the times when I was little, whenever I got sick they would take care of me...so I associated pain with nurture. Reminds me of those times and brings me comfort. I don’t know why they had me in the first place if they don’t want me, they must think I’m such a bad investment. During this lockdown they won’t even offer me food whenever they eat out, but they always buy my sister food. I eat instant noodles everyday because I have to buy my own food, I’m currently a student and I don’t have much income. Idk what I did wrong...I did my best on getting good grades, I’m sorry that I’m not normal...I will pay them back someday. They must be very disappointed that their investment turned out to be like this.",SuicideWatch

PTSD therapy might end up killing me,"I had my first bout of trauma therapy last week, I'll have my second tomorrow. And honestly I'm worried that doing this might kill me.

It's no exaggeration to say I'd rather die than do this. I was so afraid of the first session I actually almost killed myself. I haven't gotten so close to it this time, but the stress of it is very clearly wearing on me. It is such an intense and scary process that it's pretty much sapping me of all my energy. Now the logical step would be to stop but the problem is I can't. The whole reason I'm doing this is to prevent suicide in the first place. I realized that if I don't confront this, it'll eventually eat away so much of me that I'll take my own life. So I'm damned if I do and damned if I don't.

It all feels so hopeless. I'm tired and afraid and I just want all of this pain to stop. I have been carrying this weight for so long. Fighting to keep myself from going insane for so long. I just want to give up. I'm so tired. I am so, so, so tired. I'm not even to my second session and already I just want to give up, as in dying give up. This torture will never end. All because of three events in my past. I've lost so many years and I feel like I'll only waste the ones remaining. Life for me is nothing but a struggle not to fall into my own despair, trying to keep my head above water. I want to give up. I want to finally stop fighting and close my eyes.

Am I normal?,"
Am I normal? I don’t think I am. Whenever I’m stressed out I tend to forget to take care of myself and it bit me in the ass today. My mom asked me why I didn’t take a bath and when I told her I forgot. She started lecturing me on how that’s not normal and I started spiraling down into a breakdown. She asked if I feel icky not washing and tbh, I don’t.  Then she started talking about how I don’t cook, or baking and stuff that my brothers did when they were my age. But I can’t do those things without thinking of killing myself 

Holding a knife? How about I stab myself with it? Turning on the stove? How about I let it burn me? I would think about those kinds of stuff when things went bad. 

Then it all went downhill when she told me that teenagers aren’t supposed to cry. To me, that’s the equivalent of her invalidating my feelings. 

I made mistakes and I’m not afraid to admit it but when I’m constantly reminded of it, it just brings up my own perception of a failure.

From gaming to drawing to reading, I’m just fascinated for a few weeks then it’s just same old fucking sadness. “Just eat better, get more sun and exercise more” yeah like that shits gonna help.

I can’t even fucking punish myself through self harming anymore because of how much of a pussy I am because I find explaining away the bruises difficult. I just want to die so I can not suffer anymore, but I don’t want to do it myself because I’m too much of a coward for that. I just wish I could go with knowing that the people around me won’t suffer, but I know how much it’d screw them up so it just constantly feels like I’m suffering just for their sakes.

wish there was a way to restart,"I’m not sure if I’m the only one who thinks like this, it feels like I am but I can’t be too sure...

I’ve had a tough life, and has just gotten shittier and shittier as time goes by, even though people say it gets better over time. This just isn’t the case for me. I’ve been pretty severely depressed and contemplating suicide for about 6 years now but never had the balls to do it. Except recently(past year or so) it has gotten significantly worse, everything I do and think about leads to leaving this world. 

I had a crazy ex girlfriend in the 8th grade who would basically stalk me and sometimes stalk my sibling. It got really annoying and emotionally draining because I thought the relationship would bring me happiness and cure my depression that started near 7th grade, but it really just made it worse. She knew that I struggled with mental health, but she just tormented me about it and would pretend to be depressed to me whenever she doesn’t get her way. I finally got the courage to break up with her in the 9th grade and just over a year of dating and I actually felt happy for once. Until she continued to follow me and boss me around. After about a month of her constantly harassing me, I stood up for myself and told her to leave me alone and go find someone else to bug. I really thought that I was helping myself at that moment but I just fucked myself even more, because she then cut herself on the chin with her fingernail in front of me and my friends, and then she told everyone I hit her, which really sucked because I know I didn’t hit her and my friends know I didn’t, but nobody else believed me. I was then looked at as a girl beater and a sack of shit, which I already felt like one but this just tipped it over the edge. I have received death threats to me and my family and was told to kill myself for something I didn’t do. And if anyone out there feels depressed and suicidal, the worst thing for someone to tell you is to kill yourself, when you already feel that way. The worst part about this situation is that she never had any proof whatsoever, but people still believed her because “she’s a girl” or at least that’s what they told me. I was so depressed after that, I just shut everything out and completely forgot that I could take legal actions, but I know now it’s too late for that.

I loved hockey and had a blast every time I played. This was the only thing in life that gave me peace and happiness. Hockey was my escape from my own life if that makes any sense. Until one game, a guy from my school that was friends with my ex targeted me and purposely “illegally” hit me. He was banned from the league, but it costed me a fractured knee. I was then told by a doctor that due to this injury, I couldn’t play hockey anymore. This absolutely broke me. The one thing that gave me happiness was taken away from me by some stuck up asshole who wanted me gone.

It’s now 6 years later with nonstop sadness. I was told that because I’m a man I shouldn’t show my emotions, so that’s what I did. I pushed them so far down that I was not only numb to emotions: I was numb to everything. And everything leads back to one mistake... a relationship. This one girl took my life and smashed it with only 3 words.

I’ve planned my death many times, but never followed through with it because of my family. I know my family loves me even though sometimes it doesn’t seem like it. I’m not even living for myself anymore, I’m just living for them. I’ve had a hard time focusing with my future career because all I hear in my head is “don’t worry, you won’t make it til then”, which seems true and honestly I’m hoping it’s true.

I want to die, but I also don’t want to die if that makes any sense at all. I wish there was a way to just press restart and have a chance to redo my life and fix everything. I thought death would give this to me, but I know it doesn’t work like that. I know with death you’re just gone forever and not given a chance to redo. As much as I want to restart, I know there’s no way to restart unless I finally follow through with it and see for myself.

If you took the time read all of this.
thank you.
I hope you find the happiness that I couldn’t. &lt;3",SuicideWatch

I think I may kill myself if quarantine keeps going on,"I want to preface this by saying I'm not in any eminent danger and I've struggled with suicidal thoughts for 9+ years. It's nothing new to me but the past few months have resulted in a depression I've never felt before.

The ironic thing is I'm studying to be a virologist. The idea of a pandemic has been on my mind for many years, and I was educated about the possibility that this would probably happen. But I never really fully understood the mental toll that this would take. I'm a very social person, it's how I cope. I don't like to sit around or I know the thoughts will creep in. I love going to bars, seeing my friends, partying, being active, exploring new places. This has become extremely difficult, basically impossible, in the past few months.

I was also dumped about a week before quarantine started. I've had no opportunity to go and try and get over them; I've just been sitting in my room ruminating about how lonely I am and how I'm wasting away my early 20s. I wanna meet new people and be carefree like I was before. I am so fucking conflicted and upset.

I feel like a brat complaining but everything is going to shit and I can't handle it anymore. I just want to distract myself but I have no good way of doing it. My friends don't care anymore because they're all busy or going through the same shit, which I get. That's why I came here to complain. I just can't handle this shit anymore.",SuicideWatch

i dont feel like a person any more. just a walking, talking problem machine. useless fucking garbage. and i dont want to die. i want to be happy and enjoy life, i see the beauty in everything around me. i just dont think it is possible for me to overcome anything. i think i am broken and have always been, and will always be.",SuicideWatch
A different kind of suicide,"I think I've reached a limit. I hate college, and admittedly I could have done better, but I try. I do. I had hopes on doing things right, but my parents have put constants threads on the way, I'm being set for failure and I'm being told I either do this or I won't amount to anything in life.

I have decided I will study. I will have the best grades possible. In ten days I have exams. My mental health is already on the limit and the world is burning anyway so what the hell, I'm going to do a non-stop study until the exams, and I won't even care about the results. I will not eat, not sleep until I'm done. If it takes me four, five, ten days, it doesn't matter. Because of them, I had already spent days without eating or drinking any water so it won't be a new experience. If I die I hope they find my body idgaf. I don't know why in life people need to be pushed so much. I'm not trying to provoque these kinds of conflicts, but whatever, I will do it. I will either pass the exams perfectly or die.

I've done something extremely pathetic and I'm suicidal because of the guilt,"After living extremelyyyyy unhealthy for a decade, constantly smoking spliffs and cigarettes and eating garbage, I quit last summer. Was playing the victim because my parents died when I was 10 and 17 yo. I'm 28 now. 

That's when I became a winner. Constantly working out, eating healthy and going to the gym. Focusing on my career.

After a while I started to crash though. Became extremely neurotic. Filled with regrets. Intrusive thoughts about how I will get lung cancer soon and die. What a loser I am and so on. 

I contacted my ex in some irrational impulse and started crying to her that I'm going to die soon. She dissed me and blocked me. I made a new account and told her why I think I'll die soon and so on. She replied for a while and said I didn't change a bit. I was like 'whut? I've turned my life around and she says I didn't change' so I again made a new account. This triggered her so much and she completely destroyed me in a message. 

Next obsession was born. Her insults were so spot on and painful that I went crazy. For like 8 weeks I would constantly hear it repeat over and over again. I couldn't take it. These words will haunt me forever. After and before work I would send her a bunch of messages and delete it again. I'm constantly fighting my irrational brain that wants to contact her and talk this out so it will stop repeating, but then I think how pathetic I am to contact her. I just want these thoughts to stop repeating and I don't want to hear it on my deathbed. It's such a stain on my life. Her pure disdain. Being talked to like you're scum of the earth. She said I will never learn how to live my life and I feel like I'm destined to prove her right. Someone you used to love who confirms your nagging feeling that you're a failure. 

And now I've lost my self-respect. Constantly hearing her insults repeat made me extremely suicidal. I'm fucking embarrassed that I was contacting her so much. I'm an insane person. I'm a loser. I'm pathetic. Life will never be the same again. How the fuck can I forgive myself for this? How can I ever feel confident about myself again? I'm so messed up. So tired of fighting my brain with its intrusive thoughts that keep going and going :(

How to make a comeback after doing something extremely pathetic?,"So.. It's hard to keep this brief.. I've lived extremely unhealthy from 18 to 27. Constantly smoking spliffs, cigarettes and eating unhealthy. It was self-medicating because I'm extremely neurotic.

After quitting I became afraid of dying young. Constant repeating thoughts. Started crying to my ex about that 🤦‍♂️ That conversation escalated. She humiliated me with a last message. It was so spot on and at the same time extremely unfair. It fucking hurts when someone you used to love treats you like you're a failure.

What happened after that was so embarrassing.. For like 8 weeks I would now constantly hear her insults repeat. Just hour after hour. Non-stop hearing what she said and making me extremely suicidal. After about a week I couldn't take it anymore and started to send messages again to explain myself, to defend myself, to say that some of it is true and some of it isn't true.. It was on instagram dm so this became a battle between my rational and irrational brain. My rational brain would delete the messages almost always constantly after sending them, but my irrational brain was then like: you should send another message because she'll reply and then you can forget about it.

And now I'm kind of done with my manic phase and I'm filled with self-loathing. I'm pathetic. I embarrassed myself too much. I can't be happy anymore. I've done something that I can't defend. How can I come back from this? Can I still be a winner in life after all this? I'm so terrified that I will fail and die young and hear her insults repeat on my deathbed..",SuicideWatch

What to do?,"Hi everyone, 

I have a new friend that I was just starting to get to know before the pandemic hit. She and I had been in touch regularly and then as we all started to work from home and get locked in we drifted a part. 

She reached out to me about a week ago and said she was looking for a change and thinking about moving to a new place. I didn't find this alarming at all. 

Yesterday I sent her a message to ask her how she was and she said she is bad. She was giving short responses and something about it was very alarming to me. I asked her if I could call her tomorrow and she said maybe. But then she went completely silent and stopped responding to my messages. 

I called her this morning and a few other times throughout the day and sent her several messages to ask if she is okay, and I got no responses. I don't know her well, but I know she lives alone. She works in healthcare and so I think she would likely understand my concern and send a text back to let me know she is okay. But maybe she is just embarrassed or something and is ignoring me for other reasons. 

I just don't know what to do. I don't know her address, or her last name, I only have her first name and her phone number. I don't know anyone that knows her so I don't know who to reach out to. I am in the US.

I want a relationship with him again (yes we've broken up twice), yet I can't be bothered. And I'm worried that if he saw me in real life again I bet he'd just laugh at my pathetic life. 

I live with my mum, I help to take care of her. She's disabled and has a medical issue. If I don't take care of her I don't know who will. She has family in her home country... Only a couple of years ago I got us away from her abusive husband...

I'm tired of pretending to be happy every day. I'm tired of just doing stuff everyday. I have no goals, hopes or dreams (except for being in my ex's arms lol).

I'm worried that my ex will eventually grow bored of me, or get sick of me, or tired of me. I'm the most boring person ever. Why would anyone even want to talk to me?

This is another reason I don't want to have friends or get involved with people. 

I wish I was never born. I'm not even a really nice person and I've made so many mistakes. I even hurt my ex like hell but he forgave me.

Why can't I just die in my sleep or something, deep down I am only miserable anyway. I'm telling myself over and over that this life isn't for me. It doesn't appeal to me. I'm sure if I had a decent upbringing things would've been different. Not like my mum was able to do much regarding that. So not her fault.

I'm not a snowflake or anything, I'm just not like everyone else. I don't see the world like 'normal' people do. 

So yeah I'm really tired, when will I get my rest?

I'm sorry for wasting your time with this boring post if you read it.",SuicideWatch

I can’t take it anymore,"The person who was my first best friend. My boyfriend of over 2 years. The person who I was the closest to, who knew everything about me. We were two peas in a pod, closer than I can describe. He left me for another woman 7 months ago and came crawling back telling me he fucked up. All my love and attachment and trust came rushing back. He promised me he would never hurt me again, promised me that he cares about me so much and he loves me so much. I tried to talk to him about how I felt on Sunday about what he had done in the past and he blocked me on everything. Tried to have my friends contact him, they were all blocked. I’m left so confused and lost and hurt. I tried to kill myself on Monday with Xanax and a bottle of whiskey but failed. I think I almost did. I would’ve if my brother and his gf hadn’t rushed to find me vomiting and sobbing and passing out. I am so emotionally attached to him and I feel like I’m falling apart at the core.

Suicide is essentially genetic,"By casually examining ten cases of suicide, four of them are absolutely genetic, that is, at the time of conception it was assured you would have committed suicide. The other six out of ten, on the other hand, occur because in a person who is extremely more at risk than the average due to genetics, environmental circumstances occur that lead you to make the leap. The latter at birth have about a 50% chance of actually committing suicide. This means that if ten people who committed suicide all had two different identical twins who never met and grew up in different environments, 4 out of 10 both twins would have committed suicide, while six out of ten one identical twin would have committed suicide and the other no.",SuicideWatch

I just broke down in front of my mom.,"Just started crying in front of my mom because of a conversation we had. 

The conversation consisted of a debate about what will make me feel better. I argued that there is nothing and she told me that being a functioning person would help me be normal again. I kept telling her that functioning has caused me nothing but pain and gotten me no where. Anyways I was very open and I think she can finally see how truly fucking miserable I am. I think I might have done myself some bad because she probably thinks she has to take things into her own hands and fix things for me because I’m incapable. Fuck life.

I took my first edible last night and it really opened me up. I had no hesitation to lay it all out on the table for my mom to see. I’m not high anymore, but I’m not back to normal yet. Someone called it the “afterglow.”",SuicideWatch

We didnt go out on a date ot anything because of covid. But lately he started pushing for us to meet. We spoke on calls a few times and then he said he wants to come to my place to see me. I said yes. He came and things happened and we slept. Then he kept on messaging me about it and it was always sexual. He kept on asking if he could come again. I said yes for Sunday he came and we had sex again. Then it was total silence from him he didnt respond to my texts or anything for 2 days. On tuesday he msgd me saying he was busy with work. I was very depressed the whole week. Today I got a call from his number, when i picked up it was a woman shouting and cussing me. She was his wife. I'm in a state of disbelief. I got used to be cheated on someone. I am a homewrecker. Something i have felt so strongly about the whole life and have stood against my whole life. I did the same I'm a fucking homewrecker.

"I been low before, but this is new","Almost daily it hurts to breathe. I’m either crying or numb. Any happiness is fleeting, and I have to feign it far too much for work. I feel my friend group is falling apart, my community is falling apart, and I feel so helpless. I want to stand with the people and protest, but I think I’ll just end up having a panic attack on the street which feels pretty counterproductive. I’ve been having panic attacks just being at home.

Last night my boyfriend came to me crying, too. I hate when people cry around me. I don’t know how to console them. There is certainly a misogynistic part of me that especially doesn’t want to see men cry. I don’t know how to battle with that part of myself. I tried to embrace the discomfort, but I’m so bad at it. He’s always battled with depression/anxiety, but he told me recently he’s been having suicidal thoughts. He knows I have suicidal thoughts daily. I don’t know what to say to him to help him. Obviously I’m there for him and all that, but how can you help someone who is drowning if you don’t know how to swim? 

It’s very hard for me to be strong by myself. Now I have to be strong for him, too. 

I’m having trouble finding even one good thing every day. I’ve considered calling the hotline, but I don’t think it will help me. I know the calm down and grounding strategies. The problem is my mind won’t stop circling with thoughts of injustice and war. Normally I’m tough on myself and try to pull my head outta my own ass. “Oh boohoo for you, at least you have food on the table and a roof over your head.” That hasn’t been working. I can’t pull myself out of it.

So I pretty much have no social interaction, and I just feel lonely.

It kills me knowing how easy it is for everyone else to have friends and get a girlfriend, and I can't even do either of those things. I try to act as normal and not desperate as I can, but I have no social skills and nobody wants to be my friend.

I just wish things were different,"I wish my brother would just kill himself. I bet everyone would mourn his death. But if I died, what would people know me for? Probably for being a pussy who didn't land a punch on his little brother. I'm always the bad guy in situations like this. Even when mom tells me to let it go, she never gave me a single instance where I was the good guy. In this case, I got a little too close to mom and my brother came in and socked me a couple of times. He was the knight in shining armor that defeated the monster.   


That was always the case with me. Any time there was an altercation, I was always the instigator. Everyone has at least one reason to hate me, even going as far back as elementary school. It was also during that time where I started comparing myself to my brother and who wouldn't? I was on the cusp of getting expelled multiple times while he was learning at a faster pace than everyone else. After that, I didn't really pay attention but according to mom, it was still there.   


I have no idea how anyone would just punch their sibling and would just go with their day. It's borderline psychotic if you ask me. But that was just what broke my mind. I've had these things billowing in my head for years. I can't stand them. Thoughts about what would happen if I told people what I was doing. I would always think about that. That's why I'm never comfortable talking to people directly and would prefer to do it through text-based means.  


Anyway, I'm writing this down as a way to put my thoughts somewhere because I fear if I kept them inside, bad things would happen. Either I would kill my brother, myself, or both. I can picture how I would go down now. I pick up a knife from the drawer and stab it in my stomach, my eyes closed when it happens. Blood pouring through my white shirt as I fall to the ground, trying to scream for mom but nothing comes out.

Everything is a bit overwhelming right now,"I am an American citizen, I am black and Mexican.

We all know what's going on right now.

I have always wanted to die. I've failed a few times because I got scared, I gave some sort of hint at a crucial moment, or even that I actively sought help. I'm 20, and ever since I was in middle school, I planned to die at 17.

I have no motivation and no dreams, my dream was to die and I couldn't even do that.

I'm alive because I've basically been guilty into it, ""My parents will be sad."" ""My boyfriend doesn't want me to."" ""My stepmom also suffers from depression and loves me so much she might kill herself in response.""

I've always hated that. I have to live and breathe and suffer so that the people around me don't have to. They say suicide is selfish, but isn't them wanting me to stay alive and suffer selfish.

I've been ok lately, but with the protests going on and the violence increasing, I can't help but hate myself.

I'm too scared to protest because I'm worried by boyfriend's family will hate me. I've always hated my own skin for being the color it is. I've always wished that I was white. I myself have participated in racism against blacks, against myself. I know it all stems from self hate or whatever.

I don't care about the thousands or millions of people out theres chanting black lives matter. I want the people in power to tell me my life matters. I've blocked out police brutality in the past, I've ignored racism around me, because as a lighter skinned person who grew up around white people and who talks like a white person and who doesn't act stereotypically ""black"", I've always been more accepted. Though as a black person, I've still been the butt of many jokes.

I hate it all. I hate myself. I'm finally starting to care and it hurts and I want to drown it out and act like none of it is happening but I can't. I'm guilty of wanting to live in ignorance again and I'm guilty of contributing against the cause and I want to die.

I have nothing left to give or to say,"I am a narcissist diagnosed with incurable cancer at a young age. I have studied psychology and philosophy extensively yet it has given me no answers which I could use to tackle the problem of suicide. It's all just ways to fabricate an uncaring reality in to something more palatable. I was supposed to be the person to help people through their life's problems, not be a problem myself. People don't care of cancer patients. They hate them, because they remind them that we are all cheating ourselves. No one lives forever, the world is unjust and largely deterministic.

Not even Camus', one of my favorites, absurdism goes beyond acknowledging that everything is meaningless and continuing to live in spite of it. I see people throw their life away. I can not relate to anyone anymore. Nothing brings me joy or comfort. I tried to escape and fabricate my own worlds but soon realized that even that is only a temporary comfort. My untimely death will leave my girlfriend without anyone in this world. I have no doubts that she may attempt or even commit suicide. There is no meaning to anything.

I am sorry. I must end my rant. The end is nigh for our planet, there is no escape from this cursed existence.

Slowly giving up on life...,"Hi everybody, I know that a lot people with the similar problems are here, so please help me. My native language isn't English, so sorry if I am gonna make some mistakes. My problem is that my father is always mocking me and talking to me in the wrongest ways ever. I am not that good at school and he always points that out when we are at home or when he is with his friends. Once I was at his birthday party he started mocking me in front of them and talk things like ""It will be a miracle if he will ever graduate"" and a lot of other things like that. Even some of his friends were shocked how is he behaving to me and tried to stop him with changing the topic. I am trying my best, but the truth is that I am really depressed and anxious for a long time. His behavior wasn't good even when I was a child and my bad memories with him from the past haunt me. He was living a very wild life before he met my mother. He always wanted a children, so he grabbed the first opportunity and married my mother a few months after he met her. He was young and stupid (now he is older and stupid). However his habits from before marriage times didn't disappear. Suddenly he had me, but he also wanted to do the same things as before (partying with his friends, drinking a lot and fucking the hoes. Sorry for that word :/). Anyway the thing is my mother developed a schizophrenia and killed herself a few years ago. Also maybe because he was such a dick to me and her in the past that her brain couldn't handle that much stress and fear that she got from him. She attempted a few suicides, before her final one in a mental health hospital. From that moment everything is even worse, because he didn't know what to do when he was suddenly alone. He never really knew how to raise children properly, so always when I had a ""problem"" like he likes to call it, he mock me or tell me that I have to be quiet, because he will beat me. Now I am almost 18 and I want to live my own life, but he is always pushing me down and due to my complexes from him I can't face him. I know that I am probably overreacting, but sometimes I am afraid of him, because I know how crazy he can got. What is the best advice to deal with all of this? Sometimes I am thinking about killing myself, but then I remember about people who love me like my grandparents or best friends, that I can't no more hangout with due to my anxiety and depression. His parents actually know how big of a jerk he is. I have so much nerve on him that I would fucking beat him, but I don't want to do that. Please help me solve this situation, thanks.",SuicideWatch
The shame..,"5 months ago I was an extremely suicidal and pathetic mess. I contacted my ex. This conversation escalated.

I wanted to kill myself to make those thoughts stop, but I'd only prove her right with that. 

I feel so embarassed that I was acting like this too.. I feel like I lost my dignity. Her insults will repeat on my deathbed. I can't shake them. It fucking sucks. Something died inside of me after hearing what she's said and I'm very afraid it will never come back. It doesn't help that I'm extremely neurotic.

I'm alone again, I feel like I'm getting slower and stupider and uglier. And the beautiful mask I had created has shattered and can't be worn again because I know it to be a lie.

I am finished. I can't be mediocre, I can't love again after having the best, anything else would seem like less.

Just don’t get the point of living anymore,"Life has become a constant state of waiting for the next shoe to drop and lately they’ve been coming in rapid succession. I’m going ever so deeper into debt and have fuck all to show for it. I paid over $10K last week for what effectively ended to being a lonely, four day long euthanasia for my beloved pet. I just don’t really get the point of it anymore.

I was on a bike ride the other day and had the thought that maybe I could swerve into traffic, but most likely I’d just end up with a nuisance injury and more debt.

"unfortunately, some of us are just dealt unplayable hands","that's just the reality of this existence. if your brain and/or body is truly and genuinely broken beyond repair, then by all means you have every right to leave. 

""normal"" people will never quite understand this concept. they can only see existence through their own lens. it's inconceivable to them that some of us are authentically suffering due to things beyond our control. (by the way, I don't begrudge them for this at all.)

""suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem"". well what if your problem is permanent?! and some of our problems are truly lifelong sources of pain and misery. sometimes, the cold, hard, shitty truth is ""suicide is a solution to a problem"". 

don't get me wrong, this existence can be fucking amazing. Life Itself is intensely, almost overwhelmingly, beautiful. but only if you get to experience it within certain, though fairly wide, parameters. 

if your mind is broken, if your body is weakened, if you're undergoing insurmountable levels of trauma... by all means let yourself be free from your suffering.

Life, Liberty, &amp; the Pursuit of Happiness. if any of these are outright denied to you, then do yourself a favor and quit playing the game in which you'll always lose.

Advice on behalf of my grandma,"My grandma lives in India, and unfortunately she is blind and feeling suicidal in the last few days. 

In an arguement with her sister when she asked where she was going she said I am going to die

I am so worried for my parents and relatives. I have a high risk condition so cannot travel. My dad has diabetes. But my mum doesnt want to him to travel to India because she is worried for my dad and says that as her sister and other family is there she is fine.

My mum has no sense of mental health and thinks that the depression is very little and my dad should wait for a cure for coronavirus. 

My dad has been unemployed and is currently not working and my mum has been supporting my family. I have also decided to take on some online tutoring atm and have made some adverts in to get some money to help out, and I have tried to advertise on fb but I cant afford it.

Currently my parents had a massive fight on whether to go to India or not to make sure my dad if possible can prevent anything bad from happening. I am so lost and scared. I dont know what to do. Please can someone give me any advice and which one of my parents is right and whether it is worth my dad going to India to see my grandma. 

My dad also has a sister in USA but the situation is bad atm over there and there are no direct flights available. From the UK there arent any flights available wither.

My dad said he would allow my mum to go but no one in the family likes her as her intentions are pure but the way she talks and is always incorrect and says stuff like this level of depression is not showing anything as my grandma is continuing to eat, not walking out of the house or acting psychotic. 

Apart form that suicidal comment not sure if it was joke or not but I am so worried, as I have been suicidal too and my mum doesnt seem to grasp the importance of mental health. At the same time I dont want my dad to die. 

Any advice will be greatly helpful

Tldr should my dad (has type 2 diabete) risk flying to India after the quarantine in India ends and flights return to normal to see my grandma(his mum) who is having suicidal thoughts 

My main question is what can I do to help my grandma in India (who only speak hindi) I live in the Uk",SuicideWatch
I have never been so alone in my entire life,"I’m a 19 year old girl and I just spent a week of involuntary inpatient. Got home yesterday. A week ago I destroyed my relationship with my parents. My relationships with my counselors. My relationships with all of my friends. My girlfriend broke up with me. I don’t have a job (corona related). I failed all of my classes this semester. I’m in debt. I was in the throes of an earth-shattering manic episode that came to an explosive crescendo that began with substance abuse and peaked with hospitalization. Now my mood is coming crashing down and flaming hurdling down into the depths of hell. I can feel the mania wearing off and now I am left to clean up the collateral damage alone. I don’t even feel real. No interaction with anybody I know feels real or meaningful. It feels like I don’t have anything to live for. I ruined my life in 2 weeks but I’ve been suicidal for years. I never thought I would say it, but I miss the psych hospital. This was the second time in 2020 that I’ve been institutionalized against my will. This fucking decade is bringing me to my knees. I feel like I died at some point in my sleep and didn’t know it and now I’m in purgatory. The world is ending.",SuicideWatch
"My arm, my family and my life is messed up.","I'm so so so tired, yet, I can't sleep and it just keeps draining me. Every time I wanna fall asleep, I either overdose on a drug(not dangerous to OD on, functions as a sleep medicine when OD'd), cut myself or cry myself to sleep. Tonight I've been cutting.

It's so hard. It's 10 days till my next and second therapist appointment and I don't know if I can wait so long. I'm already going nuts fainting throughout the day due to lack of sleep, and no energy to make food or anything, so I'm basically only eating easy foods like fruits for dinner and lunch, then my mom cooks up something good for dinner.

I constantly get bugged on for not studying hard enough, being lazy. Well, I can't. I'm literally fainting and get suicidal thoughts with extreme anxiety whenever I study. What gets me away from that though is playing games, so others see me play games and being lazy, I see it as a medicine to help with my problems.

Yeah I don't know... Guess I wanna try to write off my feelings/suppress them to maybe get through another day.
I'm just so tired of lying to everyone.
""Will you finish high school?"" - uhh sure? I'm not gonna drop off at all.
""I haven't spoken to you for 4 months, are you ok?"" - sure I am, just been busy
""Why won't you study?"" - I'm tired.

If it's not lies, it's a excuse.
I feel like a idiot, a moron, a cock. I feel like someone that was born to kill themselves.

I know it might sound like I'm just lazy, but you get really tired from self harm, self hate, depression and loneliness. It really drains you more than you might think. I can barely get out of bed, even though I haven't slept. I only get out of bed because I must if I don't wanna get kicked out.

I'm pretty much the definition of a loser too. Someone with 0 friends, just sits inside, plays games, goes to sleep, fails school. A depressed fucking loser.

What counts as a suicide attempt? (My story),"I have tried to kill myself two times, but both times I have been talked out of it. I am certain that I would have gone through with them if no one had talked me out of it (although I am glad I didn't). I suffer from Depression and Psychosis of unknown cause, come from a very anti mental illness family who believethe root of all mental illnesses is selfishness, and my therapist along with my trusted teacher refuse to believe I am struggling despite me telling them over and over again because I am ""strong and smart"" and I'll just ""get through it on my own."" These were all major factors that made me want to commit suicide overall.

I want to know if this counts so I know if I can say I attempted suicide if I go to a mental hospital (only my friend and boyfriend know about it) and so I know if it is appropriate for me to be called a suicide attempt survivor.

suicidal and alone again so im here.,"i recently left an online friend group that was extremely toxic for me. even after i left they would stalk my social medias and wouldn’t leave me or my friends alone. 

everything was stressing me out and my friends got angry at me for accidentally making the drama worse. i left that group too. i feel that they got fed up and tired of me, and i realized that our friendships were one-sided and weren’t that intimate.

i cut them off and i’m alone again. i had always
depended my happiness on online friends but now they’re gone.

this is the fourth time ive lost a friend group. i feel that im truly meant to be alone. these past two years have been awful, and i was hospitalized three times.

plus, all these current events are just stressing me out. with covid and protests im at my limit and ive just shut off social media entirely. so im taking a break.

How to hurt others as little as possible,"Hi

I've contemplated ending my life for years. The problem is, I know it's going to hurt many people around me. I'm looking for ways to minimize the harm caused to others. 

My parents are dead but I do have two sisters and a couple of close friends. 

My attachment style is, well, Messed Up, to say the least. Anything but secure. My self-image and identity are in no way cohesive. They're not just fractured, all they are is a pile of slivers of something that could have one day been a coherent human personality. Emotionally, I'm a child. I have BPD with vulnerable narsissistic traits. All I ever want to hear or talk about is myself. I don't genuinely care about anyone elses interests or thoughts.

I really really don't want to put them through the pain of losing someone to suicide, but I'm also not able to live for decades and decades to come (I'm 23 and physically healthy). I've been put in a terrible situation, there are no winning moves, only an impossible one and a deeply destructive, hurtful one.

My therapist threatened to put me in hospicare,Last week I went back to therapy after thinking I was done for so long... I’ve gotten worse in the time I quit and I was so overwhelmed with hurting I was becoming a danger to myself.

I'm sorry my trip to the psych ward for a couple weeks is an inconvenience to you. I'm sorry my employer had to find someone else.

I'm sorry that you worry about your own safety due to my deteriorating mental health. I'm sorry I make you feel guilty. I'm sorry I'm such a fucking burden. 

Except no, I'm not fucking sorry.

If I was able to get help, I would. I tried everything in my power to get what I need, and I cannot. I never ask for money. I never ask for sex. I never ask for anything except support and love. And access to health resources I need, and a job that treats me like a human. 

The more you call me spoiled, entitled, bratty, without even listening to my issues, the more ignorant you just look.

To my parents: you don't have a second child. To my ""friends"" who ignore me: you don't have a distant friend. To my ""boyfriend"" who basically ignores me half the time: maybe you don't gave me either, and you can easily find someone else anyway. 

I'm not going to work every day for this. I'm not driving my mom all over town wherever she wants for this.

I'm not sure why or how long i will keep going,"My life has been miserable since the minute i stepped into this planet, i suffered from awful bullying from pre-school all the way to college, becoming severely depressed and trumatized along the way. Never told anyone, never got help, i made it out of depression by myself a few times only to find myself back in. I never had a single friend, not even just someone to hang out or talk to, let alone relationships. I spent my childhood suffering in silence and being beaten up and humiliated. 

I have always been shorter than my peers (i'm a male so that's problematic), and due to a certain condition i look younger than my age, so everyone treats me like a kid. That along with the fact i have always been shy and quiet made me the ultimate target for the most foul ways of harassment.

From 13 to 18 it was the worse, i sunk into a dark abyss so deep that it took all i had to get out and keep going. I failed highschool, got into college twice and dropped out, got kicked out from another. I just couldn't cope with the horrible loneliness and pain.

Last year was so awful i had psychotic breakdowns, i started to hallucinate and became highly paranoid. So i started coping by starving and beating myself up as a means of building enough willpower so i can go about my day and study at least.

I'm 22 now and still live with my parents which are nice enough to support me, i own them everything, but i'm miserable. I don't talk to anyone at the school i attend to, just like all the previous places, i'm invisible. It took more than my entire soul to get here and i achieved nothing, i'm a failed virgin with no actual skills and more mental issues than i can count. I can barely talk to people and i sure as hell can't get a job. I have zero friends and don't really leave my house unless i have to.

I failed the window of learning how to socialize and be a normal person and now it's too late for me, i will never be able to integrate into society again, even if i make it into college again and get a job what awaits me? A life of loneliness and pain.

"Help me, please.","I am a female and I’m only 15 years old, yet the thought of dying is overwhelming me. 

Here is a quick backstory v

Before my dad divorced my step-mom, I lived with her an her three kids. Let me just say, those 12 years I lived with them were the worst years of my life. I was constantly verbally abused by her three kids, and even by her sometimes. They didn’t like me simply because I wasn’t their real sibling, and they even told me that. I hated myself and even more, I hated my life. I am a mixed girl, my biological mother is African American, and my father is Caucasian. I grew up in a mostly white neighborhood, and I was always picked on because of the way my hair and skin looked. I was so mad at the world, I always wondered why I was even born. My dad traveled all the time due to his job, which meant I only saw him for 4 days every 6 weeks. 

I felt as if I was alone in the world, and that nobody cared about me. Eventually, my dad finally realized that I couldn’t live there anymore after I attempted to run away from home. He divorced my step-mom in the Spring of 2018. The day I found out was probably the most exciting day of my life. Him and I moved in with my grandparents and are currently still living here almost three years later. My life has been so much better now, and I’m thankful for all of the love my family has given me. However, my anxiety and depression has recently gotten worse and I don’t know what to do. 

I have no friends at school, I sit at lunch alone most days. I’m not in school right now due to Covid-19, which I am kind of enjoying because I hate being social. I see people I thought were friends hanging out with people and never thinking to invite me anywhere. It’s always been me who reaches out, and I’m sick of it because nobody will ever do the same. I’ve been feeling very lonely nowadays and it’s really taking a toll on my mental and physical health. I’m barely eating and I feel like dying every single day. The only thing keeping me alive is the thought of leaving my dad all alone in this world. I want die, but I don’t want my loved ones to be devastated. I’m ashamed of this, but sometimes I hope to get into a car crash with my family so we can all die together. 

I have a therapist, but I’ve never told her about those thoughts yet. I’m not sure if I should because she thinks that I’m getting better. In fact, my whole family thinks I’m fine now, and that having a therapist is, “unnecessary”. Truth is, I’m not fine, I’m just really good at hiding it. I really need help, I’m afraid one day I’m just going to snap and end my life. But, I don’t really want to die, I just want to feel alright.

Is this just me?,"I hope someone can relate to me in this situation; I've been looking around to see if anyone felt the same way but cant seem to find much result.

I feel like I've reached the point of being suicidal where I'm actually okay with it. The plans of taking my life does not scare me anymore like it used to when I was a child; I feel at ease with my choice.

I not only want to die, but I'm ""happy"" to die. I'm not in a state of emotional instability; I'm not sobbing on the floor with a bottle of pills in my hand. I'm just contently numb.

People seem to think that when someone is on the verge of taking their life that they're a mess; portrayed as literally insane, you never seem to see those who aren't like that. Who have had the intention of taking their life for so many years that the thoughts become family. 

My life is a mess but I feel quite indifferent to it. I mostly drift into the days wondering if I'm even awake; I feel like I'm dreaming, but it's time to wake up.

When I first had suicidal thoughts, they scared me. I wanted to take my life but I was too scared to go through with it because it was all so uncertain; when it started, I just wanted to be happy.

I don't want to be happy anymore. What is the point? If I am, then I'll only be worried about the inevitable fate that is my unchosen death. I've wasted my life; housebound and unable to keep a single relationship going, I just see that I've done the most in life that I can; that j want to.

I used to worry about what will happen after death, but I don't want an afterlife. I just want my promised black abyss.

I'm a control freak when it comes to myself. The idea that I can not choose my death makes me mad; taking my life is going against the natural process of life and death; it feels like taking back the control of my body that I lost with my mind. 

For as long as I can remember, my mind and body haven't corresponded. I have a body that wants to survive, being controlled by a mind that wants to die; it'd awfully chaotic. 

The only thing that excites me is swallowing enough pills to watch the body that has tortured me for so long shut down. I feel disconnected from it, as if it is an enemy that just be destroyed.  

I'm okay with losing this war, I'm okay with admitting defeat; I'm okay with being suicidal.

I'm okay, yet I know I'll never be ""okay"", and I'm okay with that too.

Thank you for reading.",SuicideWatch
I’m gonna kill myself one day this week,"The only thing stopping me so far has been guilt that I feel about the fact that someone will have to find me and deal with my body.

My parents are selling my childhood house, they’ve already moved out. It’s empty. I figure I can do it there, and if I call the cops before I do it and let them know to send a clean up crew then no one will end up having to find me or deal with it. I doubt anyone would care enough to identify my body at this point anyway, so that’s not even gonna be a problem. 

The only thing I worry about is botching it. I cringe at the thought of being kept alive in support or something. Why isn’t euthanasia legal yet here in the states? It’s cruel.

Feeling odd,"So I have this necklace I made, it has a quote from my fav poem.  The poem baslicly says you don't need to kill yourself today, just try, see what happens, you can always kill yourself later.  I made the necklace perhaps 8 years ago in a bhc.  I'm 35 and I struggled with depression, anxiety, so ect ect since at least the 5th grade.

Anyways I just feel odd... Oh yeah that necklace broke yesterday.  So it broke yesterday and yesterday I had a nice day.  But over all I have been slipping back into depression and haven't been taking my medication or going to appts.  I kinda have kinda given up the last few years, can't bring myself to work anymore...  Wait what am I doing, I didn't mean to tell you my history.

Anyways.  The necklace broke and I really liked it but things come and go and it's not what upset me.  If anything I appreciate that I liked it and it's time had come.  

But what makes me feel odd is my current level of safty, how I would probably agree to death at this moment, mixed with the unavailablity of a bch to feel safer as well as the necklace that reminded me to die another day not today, died that day.  Almost as if it were a sign or a stopwatch and perhaps that later day is today...  

I have been passively planning on not living in the future.  I don't care for possessions or money.  I mostly spend on food or other consumable things.  But I didn't plan on leaving now, but it makes me think why not now.  What more would even come...  Nothing new and nothing good has happened lately, if anything it is as always, consistently getting slightly worse...  

I'm not in danger atm, I just feel really odd.  As if death actually showed up and said that he is here to forfill my wish but now I don't wanna go, and he asks why and I don't know...  I just feel hopelessly odd atm about living, just like I felt hopelessly alone when I was a young virgin...  Perhaps I'll always live this story just with different names and places...  Perhaps life will get a tad better at some point.  But even if it doesnt, I had some deeply loving relationships (in my ruminating daydreams) and those feelings are something I will always treasure and hopefully I'll someday learn to forgive others for expecting perfection from me but give me less than minimum when talking about the deep feelings of love and validation I once got from my ruminations.  

And even if I don't, I ask that if you need to daydream about me.  I'd love to do anything to make you happy.  I just wish we as people would actually care that deeply for one another, but it always seems to be some bastardization of that...  But it's ok.  I love you even tho I will never know you.

Edit: if anyone is interested here is the poem

""To the Young Who Want to Die,"" by Gwendolyn Brooks

Sit down. Inhale. Exhale.
The gun will wait. The lake will wait.
The tall gall in the small seductive vial
will wait will wait:
will wait a week: will wait through April.
You do not have to die this certain day.
Death will abide, will pamper your postponement.
I assure you death will wait. Death has
a lot of time. Death can
attend to you tomorrow. Or next week. Death is
just down the street; is most obliging neighbor;
can meet you any moment.

You need not die today.
Stay here--through pout or pain or peskyness.
Stay here. See what the news is going to be tomorrow.

Nothing has worked. I'm still a fucking mess. I've done so many different treatments that were 'perfect for my issues' and they. didn't. work.
I'm not stupid. I'm not delusional. 
Looking at it rationally I am way more likely to keep living like a mess. So what it the issue? Just so I can fuck up 10 more years and still end up killing myself? Hurting everyone around me in the mean time? HOW is that the better option? How is me killing myself and getting rid of the problem not the best possible option? I know I've tricked people into loving me and they will be hurt. But me being alive is so much worse for them. 

Staying alive just means more pain. Staying alive just means more problems. Staying alive just means ruining more lives. The magical possibility of things going better is not worth all of that.

People who have the possibility to maybe possible live get their plugged pulled all the time. What so different with my situation? You look at all the options, pros and cons and make the hard decision.

I'm losing Everything. Long Read,"My house for the last five years just got sold for a cash offer, leaving me only 2 weeks to move out. I should mention it is a large property in a desolate area with two other homes on the property. My home being the least desirable, it was owned by my family and when my father died it went into a trust with his four siblings and my mother. Things are very ugly with my family, I took care of my dad for four years helping my mom, with the rest of the family doing jack shit. That's all fluff but what remains the same is I am losing the only place I've called home in my adult life during a pandemic with a two-week notice. The owner some techie who struck rich by making an algorithm is buying my home just to tear it down, I asked him to at least give me 30 days just so I can move out properly, but that's not happening. 

I have sacrificed a lot to be here, I have a community here, I worked with my neighbors, fixed one of their sinks, one had a stemi and I helped save his life, my other neighbors are drinking buddies, I will never have what I am losing. 

I'm a paramedic, I cannot tell you how much I hate my job, I work per diem due to this whole COVID-19 thing I can't get enough shifts to pick up work, I'm not getting the money I usually am let alone the 600 a week like everyone else. I've worked just over 2 years as a medic and I've had 2 Pedi-codes and a non-viable traumatic birth, all of which haunt me in my sleep plus much more. I had an injury off the clock that took 8k out of my savings and took me out of work for a year. The entire ""Hazard"" pay is getting the shaft, who knew that private EMS would not care for their employees during a god damned pandemic. I cannot stress to you how much I hate my job, I'd be better off if I just got laid off. 

I can't find a place to live, I refuse to move back in with my mom who lives in a senior living community in the middle of nowhere in a trailer. I'm panic attack where my chest hurts, I see different colors, and can feel my pulse in every inch of my body, I feel like when I'm having one of these I am going to die. I can't pack my bags, or anything. 

I haven't received a final notice of when to get out but my guess is the 15th if I'm lucky. I can't find a home in a market this saturated, during a pandemic, and when I'm flat fucking broke. I can't afford the first-month last month. I was actually planning on buying my shitty little house to raise a family in.

Things aren't worth living for with this place, they for sure won't be without it. I will never have a place like this again, some of the only memories I have of my dad are going to be bulldozed in a few weeks. 

I can't see my therapist due to the social distancing thing, and every time I talk to her on the phone she begins crying. I really can't think of myself being alive in two weeks. I just plan on shooting myself in my room have the douche buying the place power wash my brains off from my ceiling, no memories of dead children, it'd just solve my problems. It makes sense, it's what the universe or Ghandi or Jesus or Vishnu wants.

I need help now,"Hi everyone I don't really post on reddit so please excuse my formatting or whatever I just need help.

I've battled anxiety and depression for nearly 20 years (female turning 30 and the first thought i had of suicide was when i was 10). I've gone through programs, medication, hospitalization, diet/exercise improvements, the whole shebang several times. I'm at a decent point in my life and have friends around and a partner who cares about me but for the last few days my anxiety has tipped to a breaking point and I am not okay.

Overcoming social anxiety has been my greatest struggle and the last few days I have been put to the test so goddamn hard. So many impromptu gatherings from my partner's family (I no longer speak to my own they are abusive) and I am just completely out of spoons. Social interaction takes a fuckton out of me but I haven't had a choice lately. I've been fighting back panic attacks every second for the last 4 days at least. Today I couldn't do it anymore. I've been crying and shaking and I couldn't get my ""game face"" on. I straight up told my partner I am having a really hard day because my anxiety has hit a breaking point. I couldn't get myself together to watch my stepdaughter so he had to take her out with him. He tries to understand but he is also out of spoons for his own reasons, and today told me my anxiety is ""the stupidest fucking thing ever and i don't understand why you can't just not have anxiety.""

When they came back, he threw something at me that i wasn't prepared for. It was a plan to get something done today that we had discussed earlier in the week but in my days-long anxious state, I had forgotten and he just SCREAMED. Told me to act like a fucking adult and handle my shit because ""that's what we're all doing."" I understand that's what we're all doing, and it is absolutely my fault that I forgot, but all I've wanted for the past 4 days is some fucking compassion from my partner about my mental health because I CANNOT FUCKING EXIST AND TAKE CARE OF MYSELF WHEN EVERY DAY IS SUDDEN SOCIAL FAMILY PARTY INTERACTION and he's an extrovert and doesn't get that I guess, i don't know.

We've been through so much but I can't seem to get him to understand that yelling at me WHILE I'M HAVING A PANIC ATTACK is not helpful at all, and now i'm wondering if my mental illness is just too much for anyone to love me and I just want to die. I don't know how to live in this world.

And I feel selfish for losing control of my mental illness because of all the fucked up shit going on in the world right now, but I need at least one person to tell me that I should keep trying because I can't keep up with these panic attacks anymore, I don't know how to keep a brave face on anymore, I don't know where to get help anymore, I'm just sobbing as a write this and I'm sorry it was so long but I need help.",SuicideWatch

Please help me. Please.,"I've been battling (officially diagnosed) Major Depression, BPD, ADD, and Aspergers my entire life, and it has not been kind. I am at the end of my rope with water-damage I can't afford, family I don't have, and (not) surprisingly, myself. 

My wife *might* miss me. That's all I've got. 33 years on this god-forsaken patch of dirt and all I have to live to live for is the one human in the world who basically *puts up* with me on the best of days. I've reached out to most text and call hotlines already, but I'm at the actual end of my rope. 
 
Every single one of those communications? I get that people care, and are trained for 'talking' to people in crisis, but it has never helped me. 



Meds haven't helped either, and I've spent two fucking decades at this point adjusting/readjusting/messing with them. 

I've come to terms with the fact that I desperately want to not wake up tomorrow, buy whatever means necessary.

I'm tired of trying to please other people. Long. Second Person for the majority of post.,"Living is about meeting other people's expectations, and changing based on their reactions and judgement of you. Don't try to spill any bullshit about ""you can live without others"" because you can't. Even if you try to go about your own life, it's not as if we live within a vacuum, void of other human life. If you do nothing, someone will judge you and therefore treat you differently. If you do something, the same thing happens.

I've learned to live with people I don't care about forming judgement about me. However, I do care about what people I enjoy think about me. Still, there's never a way to please anyone.

You do one thing. It's too much, and it's too little. You do another thing. You did it wrong, or it was right but not enough or way too much. You make a compromise. Eventually, the other party keeps pushing it their way, and when you finally take a step up and speak out, it's too late and they've gotten accustomed to it and you're the one with attitude.

It's the little comments, the ones that aren't targetted, that push me over the edge. Initially, you were hesitant to do the challenge, but one friend had challenged you. You check to see how many other people are doing it, there are a lot. You decide to do it. You do the bare minimum, it's done. Later that day, you see a general post by a different friend calling ""'doing xxx' is a plague"". They say it's hypocritical and that people who do it are insincere. You know that it wasn't directed towards you, but towards a trend that you have participated in, but the judgement is still there. It stings, and you later delete the post of what challenge you had done. You're tired.

It's the ignoring of your words. You have begged to quit an activity for 2 years after your mother forced you to change teachers without asking you first, and this is the first time you've despised a teacher. You make an agreement, ""five lessons"". Five lessons are over, you ask to quit. They ask ""five more"". This continues, and eventually, ""fives lessons"" becomes ""until xxx event one year into the future is done, then you can quit"". You've done the event. It's been 2 months, you're still doing the activity. You've had enough, and lash out, demanding to quit. Suddenly the deadline is extended ""til the end of summer"". When will enough be enough? You demand to stop. They don't listen. You're the troublesome child, and they're sick of your 'disobedience'.

Four years ago, you had moved. New place, new friends, and it was fine. You were just a little sad, but that was to be expected. You daydreamed about plans you and your childhood friends had made about the future together, knowing they won't be happening anymore. It was fine, sadness was normal. But it didn't get better. It got worse.

You started noticing all the flaws about yourself. You're overtalkative, your friends make harmless jokes that you're annoying. You laugh it off, you know they don't mean it and that they enjoy your company, but even if they don't mean it, they still thought it. It's still true.

You're second choice. Constantly. One time you ask a friend if they'd be willing to go to an event with you. You explain, you really want to go, but you don't want to go alone, and being there together would be fun. They say no, they don't want to, and you're sad, but you let it go. The event draws closer, you ask one more time, they still say no. Later, it's the day of the event. You're at home, doing work, because you didn't go because your friends weren't planning on going. You see a post online, and it's your friend you had asked. They are at the event with a few of your other friends. You ask about this later, she tells you that she changed her mind last minute because one of the other friends had begged and pleaded. You wonder if she would've done the same for you, or if it was because you weren't as close.

The years continue, you still nitpick at yourself. It gets bad two years after, you start bruising yourself to feel something, or anything. No one notices, but one person. The person asks you how you got that bruise, and you laugh it off, saying it was from being clumsy. They laugh too, and the event is over. You scratch your arms. You dig your blunt nails into your skin. You force yourself to throw up in the toilet sometimes. You stop eating as much at lunch. You wonder if you have depression. 

You daydream about dying, you look up the methods. Still, you don't do anything beyond that. Nothing permanent, no scars. You just want to feel something, and this is how you do so.

Things get better. You feel better. You stop the bad habits.

A peer dies at school. Official cause is listed as an accident ( a car hit him, a pedestrian ). Rumors at school say it was suicide. He was a friend of your friends, and they're upset. You didn't really know him, but you start thinking a lot. School moves on quickly, his death is forgotten. You know that if it was you, you would be forgotten too.

Things get worse. You feel worse. The daydreams begin again. During cross country, you're a little too close to the road center. You feel the breeze of the car as it races by. It's exhilarating, and you wonder how it would be if you were even closer.

You go biking with friends. You're a bit more careless.

Eventually, things get better. You're happier, and you laugh about every considering the notion that you were ever depressed. Afterall, other people have it worse, and you're genuinely happy. You stop the habits. The daydreams go away.

Eventually, things get worse. The daydreams return.

It's a cycle.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think I've ever wanted to die as much in my life as much as I do right now. Still, in the end, I still am consumed by other people's opinions of myself. I've got a plan now. I'll wait it out, see how I feel. Maybe things will be better when the future is more complete. I'm not depressed, nor suicidal, let me tell you that. I've had a great life. I'm lucky to have been born in great circumstances, have a loving family, and friends who care. I don't know why I hate myself and my life so much. I don't want to express my real feelings to anyone, because I know it will hurt them so much. I'm trying my best, and I'm really tired. I'm just tired.

It's not that I want to die, it's just that I'm sick of myself and my life. If things get better, I really hope that I don't feel this way in one year, but if I do? Then I do. 

&amp;#x200B;

You've got a plan. In about one year, you'll make your decision. You don't want to do it too early, as to hurt your loved ones. You know they still care. So, you'll wait it out, and see if things get better, and then choose not to do it.

You've got a plan. It'll make it seem like an accident. Hopefully. It will still hurt your friends and family, but it's more of a closure then them knowing you did it on purpose. A car accident is easy. You just hope it's enough to actually kill you, if you decide to go through with it. If it doesn't work? Too bad. I guess carbon monoxide would be much less painful, and you can blame the desire on the accident. It will hurt them, but guess what?

I'm sick of trying to please other people.",SuicideWatch

I’m suicidal. Where do I go?,"Hi guys. I’m coming up on some trauma anniversaries and between that and the fact that I’ve been isolating alone for 3 months I’m spiraling. The past 3 days I’ve spent over 20 hours researching suicide methods and imagining how I’d do it. I’ve been thinking a lot about getting my affairs in order and writing notes. I’ve been trying to utilize everything I’ve learned in therapy to help myself out of this spiral but the more I think about it the more hopeless I feel.

I’m having a moment of lucidity. I think I need to get help. What do I do? I almost went to the hospital last night but there has to be a better option. I’m very broke right now but my mom has good insurance that I can use. I don’t know where I should go. I don’t know if I should check myself into a psychiatric facility or even how to find one. I don’t have a therapist or psychiatrist and I don’t want to wait months to see one. 

My mom lives out of state. Do I call her or should I call a local friend? I don’t know what to do. I don’t think I’ll be okay if it’s just me alone in my apartment. I have some amazing local friends who have been so good about checking in with me lately. I wish I could call them and ask to stay with someone but I don’t want to ask anyone to break social distancing for me. Would it be wrong to ask for a friend to pick me up so I know I’ll be safe? I think I’m having some kind of breakdown. 

I have work I need to do for clients today and I feel so guilty because I don’t want to take their money and disappear. I keep saying I’ll finish up the work I need to do then figure out if I should go to a hospital but I don’t know if I can handle it. I thought about just sending them their money back but I’m so broke and I don’t even know if I have enough for rent and bills right now. I’m worried about ruining my professional reputation if I disappear on them. I guess worrying about that is a good sign.",SuicideWatch

I am 30, got a disease that usually only get guys in their 60s, and it progressively deforms your body in an irreversible way, and of course the changes comes with a lot of pain. Pain that is a constant reminder of what setting up for good.

"I'm trying so hard to fight this, but I'm not sure if I can. Don't know what to do.","Hi there.  
I can't manage to go through all the stuff that's wrong with me and what's going on, it would be a book. I just need some form of support. I keep getting very suicidal as soon as I'm left alone, and I'm not sure how long I can keep fighting this. Been severely depressed for 8 months (and mildly/moderately depressed for a few months prior to that). My normal state is mild depression, I am rarely ""normal mood"". I've been suicidal for the last 4 months or so.  
Loneliness is killing me. I have people in other countries, but for reasons I don't want to go into, I am stuck in one that I hate (not virus related). I only have my kid here and when they are not at home I fall apart because I can only manage to keep it together when they are home, for them. I have amazing friends and an even more amazing boyfriend, but all in other countries, and I cannot see them. It's been nearly 4 months since I saw my bf, and I miss him a lot.   


I feel like I just want to die because it hurts too much, and there is no way out of this alive, as far as I can see. I have loads of pills and alcohol that would highly likely work if I were to take them. I did do an OD in my teens many years ago, but told someone as I changed my mind. Nearly fell in a coma, but was rushed to hospital and they sorted me out. I know I am capable of it, but likewise I don't actually want to die, I just want things to be better. I cannot see a way to get better, or get my life into a place where it's liveable for me. I am doing everything I can, but not really getting anywhere. 

I don't really know what I'm asking for. I feel I can't open up to bf/friends/family as I don't want anyone to feel responsible if I were to off myself, and there is nothing they can do anyway since they are all so far away. I am scared to reach out to helplines or doctors here due to the fact I have a kid and they would not approve. It is a consequence that would make things a lot worse than they already are. I do get pills for depression that maybe will help at some point, but I am not very hopeful.",SuicideWatch
Finally figured it all out,"For years have I been wondering what's right and wrong. The only one who is right, is me. The only ones who are wrong, are people themselves. I hate them.

Everyday for 3 years. A sort of God power fantasy. I view myself as something great and mighty, yet I view myself as weak and frail.

Fake people should die. Actual people don't exist. You don't exist. I'm the only real one here. You're all toys with no goal. People think God knows everything, that he must be something good. In His eyes, yes. In your eyes, no. I will kill every last one of you fuckers one day. I'll make sure no one escapes unharmed. Man, woman, child and animal. All of you will burn for all of your crimes against me. Burn for eternity. Eternity is not enough. Infinite is not enough. You have broken the boundaries and now you people have to die.

Something is Wrong With Me But I Cant Care Anymore,"I am 21 years old and a male. I live in the United States and while I am not wealthy, I do live comfortably enough to have my own PC, go to college, and a part time job. I live with my single mother and a cousin.

I have not been diagnosed with any mental disorders but I also have never talked to a therapist or psychiatrist about my problems. For the last year and a half I have been suicidal and I also believe that I am depressed or have some sort of anxiety disorder.

I have only told a small amount of people that I was suicidal, but I haven't told any of them how badly it still effects me today and I am sure that since it was so long ago that many probably don't think I am suicidal anymore.

I would like to preface this next part saying that my mom is wonderful but at the same time I don't think she really gets my problems at all, (definitely my own fault). I have tried to talk to her about these issues but I get scared and have only been able to vaguely bring up that I would like to seek help. I told her I just thought I had anxiety issues because if I were to explain why I am suicidal I think she might hate me.

This leads me finally to why I am considering suicide. As many times as you may have heard this before, I HATE myself. Like I never understood self hatred until I experienced it myself. I constantly reflect on my actions and utterly hate myself as a human. I often lie to people I care about and act in ways that others find annoying or obnoxious. I have slowly over the last few years lost most of my friends to nothing but them not really liking me as a person. I have perpetually been the extra kid in the group that eventually is ghosted as people often get tired of me quickly and move on.

Onto my college life... After having two classes with bad grades in the last year, I now am just under the minimum threshold for the program i was hoping to apply to in the Fall. I had really solid grades at the school I went to previously but at my school they look only at the GPA you have from classes on their campus rather than all of your classes. I am now likely not getting in because of those two classes, and once that is confirmed as being the case I do not think I will be able to handle it. It will likely force me to either admit to my mother and family that my grades have been bad lately and I am not the smart and intelligent student they have imagined  me to be. My mom has a genuine blind trust in me that I use against her so much that it makes me sick to think about. My mom will then realize I have been lying to her about my grades and I do not think I can handle that. Just thinking about what might be the outcome if it came to that terrifies me and I genuinely feel like this is going to be the last straw. I feel like I am being slowly backed into a corner by my own selfish actions and I believe that it would be better for everyone if I was gone rather than making a scene for my family. If I end my life here they can chalk it up to mental illness and maybe they won't find out the real shitty person that I am.

I so desperately want to say that what others think about me doesn't matter but it does. It matters so much that it practically dictates my life now. This may seem over dramatic but this is because I once again cannot get myself to talk about the worse of my faults. I would be too embarrassed to share even on an alt account which is so stupid to say out loud because I know they are probably not that embarrassing, but the idea of sharing that stuff is scary as hell to me.

At the same time I dont want to die. I really dont. I want to live and be a good person. But at this point I want to die more than I want to be alive and I do not know how much longer I can hold onto my life. I have no faith in myself to do anything so how can I expect myself to make it thru this? I hope in a year I can reflect back on how I somehow made it through what has been the worst year of my life so far, but I feel like I might not be alive by the end of the summer. ",SuicideWatch

Such a f*ck up,"I constantly keep f*cking up. I upset everyone, I’m riddled with shame, guilt, regret and anxiety. I’ve made so many mistakes in my life and I never learn. Always taking drugs and getting out of my face to drown the emotional pain that I can’t even define. I have so much pain in my mind and yet it feels so pathetic, I keep inflicting pain onto others with my actions. I’m so fucking ashamed so regretful and so full of guilt it kills me. I want to end it all, I want to stop the hurt I impose on everyone by my stupid reckless actions, I’m a fucking waste, a loser. I have such a good job so many good qualifications and a bright future, but I keep falling back into my old ways, taking drugs to mask the hurt I feel but don’t understand. I don’t know where I stand anymore, I genuinely feel killing myself is the best option sometimes. I love my family so much but always hurt them, me being gone would rid them of the pain I cause constantly. I’m a hopeless failure, a lost cause, an embarrassment and bring nothing but hurt and shame to my family.

Is it possible to be subconciously preparing/prepared to commit suicide?,"My mental health has been awful since I was 13, I'm now 20, but for the past 2 years it's gotten to new levels I could never even imagine. For the past like 3 months, I've totally given up on any remote idea about the future, and literally have no idea who, where, i am, or what im going to do. I had originally planned to reapply to uni since I dropped out but now the deadline is in just over a month and I've not even started my application, and don't think I will, because I don't see the point or can envision a future where it happens and I just don't know how to even start again. I've also just stopped enjoying and doing so many things, I used to have multiple hobbies and things that made me happy, and now nothing makes me happy anymore, infact nothing makes me feel anything in the slightest bit of REAL positive emotion anymore, I only ever experience a flatline of nothing, or negative emotions, and all I do all day is either sleep, play games, or literally do nothing because I haven't got the energy or desire to do more. I've also just stopped speaking to so many people, part of me believes it's because our friendships were meaningless and toxic which is for the greater good but the other part of me just believes it's because I don't have what it takes to engage in friendships anymore as it's exhausting, I literally talk to about 3 people regularly... Which leads to my next point, I only talk to people I know online. The thought of actually meeting my friends makes me feel so uncomfortable and I have ZERO desire and will to be able to do so. I don't know why, I really don't, I think it's just because socialising makes me dissociate and anxious and hyper-aware and exhausted. I haven't met a friend in person in about 4 months, I wish I was normal and could enjoy it but I just don't. I'm so lonely but I can't enjoy being with others or talking to people... What's mostly made me make this post though was that for the past few days I've just been erasing so much of my past and my social media, deleting literally 100's of chats I've had over all my socials, deleting posts, removing captions, deleting friends, I just feel like I wan't to erase most of the traces of me, and forget my past, I just feel awful associating with it. So this led me to the question, even though I am depressed and don't have suicidal thoughts much, could it be possible to subconciously I'm preparing myself for it anyway?",SuicideWatch

I want to die,"I’m 14 year old and I want to die. I have the idea only adults are posting in this sub, so I have the idea only adults are the ones that sometimes really do have depression. I know others of my age sometimes say something like they want to die, but I have the idea they are just saying shit because they don’t seem really depressed. So my point is.. is something wrong with me? 

When you read this you probably think like *contact an adult* or something, but I don’t see the point of that. School will still stay boring, I’ll still be useless and life will still be pointless. 

I also don’t want to hurt my family’s feelings if I really do commit suicide, but I also don’t want to move on like this. I live in the Netherlands and I have a course on school that’s called VWO (the highest and most difficult course). School gives me way to much stress because of all that homework and stuff. My family, primary school friends and teachers all told me stuff like you’re so smart and stuff, but I don’t see the point of using that. Sometimes I just wish I was more ”normal” and had less stress about school.

I don’t know if I’m just feeling down or have severe depression. I don’t know what I should do. I find living further like this really not an option, but commiting suicide will probably hurt my family a lit. At least, Thanks for reading my post. Have a nice day.",SuicideWatch
I quit.,"I quit. 

I can’t do this anymore. The world has gone to shit. My life is a mess. I can’t keep going anymore. 

I have no career prospects. No skills. No savings. No real home. No hobbies. No friends. There’s nothing to do and nothing to live for anymore in my life. Nothing to plan or to hope for. I’m not going anywhere and I’m sick of pretending that one day, somehow my hard work will pay off, because it never does and it never will. Fuck it all. 

My partner is a fucking nightmare to be with and is totally self absorbed and unsupportive. And swings wildly between a neurotic stoner who looses it like a skittish racehorse incapable of negating basic daily life or totally callous and cold and removed. No in between. She completely sabotages EVERYTHING I try to do for myself because she’s to fucking lazy and content with living like shit to make a change in her own life and ruins any resemblance of order I try to make for myself. 

I hate my shitty life. I hate the cunts I have to sit on the phone and “play nice with” selling shit they don’t need all day while being screamed at day in day out for less than minimum wage. I am rejected from every “good” job filtered and processed by AI I and pretend I want just so I can have a basic rate of pay that is financially viable enough to live off or god forbid, save. I looked at my CV the other day and I might as well have said, “fuck me up the arse for money” and I would have had better offers. At least then I wouldn’t feel so bad when inevitable some faceless corporation comes to emotionally, physically and financially fist fuck me in the name of profit margins and wildly conflicting agendas. At least I wouldn’t be so fucking surprised.

Everyday of my life is just one big joke. I put one foot forward and it’s just straight into the next biggest pile of dog shit. Constantly wading through piles of the next worst day of my life to the next. Pretending like one day it will be better but one day never comes.

I’m ugly, I’m fat and unemployable and scratch a bare minimum of making do throughout it all. Everything I love fucks up in the end and I hate where it’s gotten me. The vapid swirling vortex of fuck all. The purgatory of wearing this fucking mask, pushing boulders, breaking my back, tearing my nerves to shreds by the handful. Grating my bones to brittle twigs for some fat lazy cunt to get rich off of who doesn’t even know I’m alive. 

Then there’s the fucking world going to fuckkery... Honestly tell me what the point would even be anymore if I carried on and if by some miracle should somehow be falling out of my ass, why bother? Pretty much everyone is dying of this fucking virus or moronically trying to spread it further with their woowoo fucking cunt faced conspiracy shit or out of sheer ignorance desperate to give one another a death sentence via coughing fit. Even if that should somehow be solved within the next 6-8 months, the worlds still fucked and passed the point of no return, waiting for the seas to boil the life out of them, the ice caps to melt, the animals to rot from inside out and the world to goatse itself into a complete inhospitable prolapsed wasteland or, at best to wander around crippled by its change and ravage with mask and life support donned, picking our way through the mess for scraps.

Fuck me, even if the world doesn’t fuck us up, the socio-economic buggery will be the equivalent of throwing a brick into the middle of a crowded bar fight. Police and totalitarianism on the horizon, double speak, riots, food shortages, poverty, fake news, social unrest, the slump of everyday life as we know it cracking its skull on the wall behind and dribbling from its mouth as it sinks to its fucking knees.

I don’t even feel good about having kids anymore... What’s the point? Their lives will probably be worse off than my own. Maybe they too will bemoan and rue my “millennial” generation for their selfish, narsasstic, self-titled “irony”. Maybe they’ll find it in their hearts to forgive a generation of people who’s entire golden existence gave them the gift of the word “selfie” and social media that harvests their data for shady governments. Maybe they can overlook the fact that I cant afford to send them to school or home them in a house and feed them because I simply can’t make enough. 

What will I tell them when the end finally comes and they ask me “What did you do to stop all of this?”... What will I say, “oh yes darling I know we now live in a filthy pile of rags under a bin in a environmental nightmare but we had banksy make up a load of pithy little tee shirts to raise awareness and subtly undermine the futility of the modern world. Isn’t that great?!” And then we can all die from a poison gas cloud melting our lungs into grape jelly.

So what’s the point? 

Honestly? Can anyone give me a fucking reason because at this point, I KNOW it doesn’t get better or easier. I KNOW that my life will just be one lurch of shit to another. I KNOW that none of this can get any better for me, I’m ready to quit. 

I have some beta blockers and a beer, I don’t want to sit around and wait anymore. 

I can’t do this. I can’t hold on. I can’t make it better. It just doesn’t go that way for me and I hate it. I don’t want to suffer anymore and be stuck poor and making do anymore. I can’t. Everyday I am stuck inside and just waiting for the courage to not be a pussy and eat all the meds I have. Who knows I’ll probably fuck that up in the end too.",SuicideWatch

third time is a charm,"I’ve been actively suicidal ever since I was a child. I been through so much of trauma which lead me to not having any emotions or feelings.

I just feel so empty and hurt all the time. Well, I guess third time is a charm.",SuicideWatch
So this is how it ends...,"I never thought I would be posting here. 

I have suffered and struggled with depression and anxiety for years over several periods in response to various issues and events. I came very close to taking my own life a few years ago but something turned me around, and I was able to see that my situation and the associated feelings may pass. And they did. I have even been able to talk openly with my family about my feelings relating to suicide, and I was able to tell them that in the event of any future episodes of loss of hope, I might just be able to stay positive, and only a major physical ailment would cause me to consider ending my life.

And sadly, thats where I am now. For reasons which cannot be ascertained, my face is becoming deformed. I suffered a minor disorder in my teens which left me with a mild asymmetry. It was able to be partially resolved with a couple of surgeries, and my life went pretty well. Not perfect by any means, but I was happy to be alive, and I know that made me lucky. My asymmetry didn't hold me back and I think that as I grew into my face it was barely noticeable. A couple of people had mentioned it over the years in an attempt to hurt me, but the fact that they would use something like that against me meant that they weren't the kind of people who held opinions that I valued. It seemed like a weak, cheap insult and made me feel more sorry for them than for me. 

Since last year something started happening to my face. First the changes were small. I could only feel them while washing my face in the shower. Nothing was visible. But following an incredible burst of growth and change in the last three or four months I am left with a huge asymmetry affecting the upper part of my face and my skull in general - in particular one of my eyes and the surrounding area. I don’t want to give details, but one side of my face and head is ballooning out in all directions. Everything is becoming crooked and twisted and as much as I wish this was in my imagination, it isn't. My concerns have been validated by medics and close family.

A scan has shown no reason for it. The symptoms and progression don’t match any of the obvious conditions which could lead to this. In fact, due to the fact that this could be seen as a reoccurrence of an earlier, long dormant issue, there is speculation that ""this could just be the way you are"". Covid means that because this isn't a malignant issue such as cancer, there's no other diagnostic route to take at the moment. But I have already run out of time. This needed to be stopped three months ago. 

The speed of progression from what I considered to be normal to where I am now has been horrific. Just a few months ago my face was mine, and it wasn't perfect but I loved it. Since then each day has brought incredible physical and emotional pain, and alongside that pain has come growth which has elongated the bones and pushed my face into a place that it shouldn't be. It has also affected my jaw severely and the function is becoming increasingly compromised. 

I have lost count of the number of photos and videos which I took to mark the progression. But I can scan through them randomly and pick out exactly when they were taken just by the shape of my face, and the extent of the disfigurement. 

My feelings started with ""maybe I am imagining this"", moved to ""well, this is happening but maybe it will stop or a cause will be found"", and I am currently at “this is inconceivable. Nobody can help me, and at this rate within two months I will be blind and unable to leave the house"". 

I am already at a point where I consider the level of disfigurement to be beyond what I can cope with. It has reached the stage where people will notice even if they aren't directly interacting with me. I am in a state of complete despair. Where I was able to see hope in the past, I see only the potential for more upset, more pain, and further loss of function. The magnitude and location of the issue means that it cannot be corrected. So each night I go to sleep knowing that today was the best I will ever look, and tomorrow will be a little worse.

The pain is almost constant. Pain itself can be alleviated a little by medication. But I know that the pain over the last few months has signified new growth, so it is reasonable to assume that continued pain means that its still happening. The fear that this brings me is indescribable. 

The time for looking at carefully angled photos and videos ended a week ago and my mind is beginning to adapt in a rather matter-of-fact way to the reality that I will spend the rest of my life in torment and pain, and the only thing which I have control over is what ""the rest of my life"" really means.

I have had tearful conversations with my mother and my sister to explain to them that I will be ending my life, and that the time will be soon. They are of course devastated. I had agreed with my mother that any final plans would be deferred until after the results of the scan, and she was right to force me to do so. I guess there was a chance that a cause may have been found for my condition. Even if the cause had itself been horrific, at least I could have blamed something for my condition. As it stands I have no idea whats happening to me. I think my mother and sister shared my hope that a cause and maybe a solution would be found. My mother says she understands my wish to end my life. We will see whether that is really the case. My sister does not. And I respect her for that. 

The absence of a root cause is bewildering, and the speed at which the changes are occurring is like nothing else I can find described anywhere online. The fact that this is happening during the isolation imposed by the Covid situation, at a time in my life where a lot of positive career and personal changes were just around the corner, and that this involves what has always been my greatest fear - facial disfigurement - makes me feel like I am in a nightmare designed especially for me.

I have told a few friends and colleagues that I have some issues with my jaw and some associated problems with my face. But thats all. I haven’t seen them due to the Covid lockdown, and working from home means I have been relatively isolated from everyone that knows me. If this affected any other part of me then I would tell them everything. And I know that if this was anywhere else on my body then I would be able to deal with it. But because it affects my face I feel a great deal of shame and embarrassment. 

My emotions about death are so confusing to me, but I can just about rationalise them. I feel justified that I will end my life, but at the same time I’m so sad that this is how things will end for me. Of all of the ways that my story could have gone this was one of the most unlikely and upsetting outcomes that I could have imagined. I have loved my life, and I wish that it could go on for a bit longer. I didn't know that I was going to have so little time. Even just another few months without this burden would bring me so much joy. 

I know that other people go through and live through so much worse. But I have reached the hard limit that I defined so clearly in my head a long time ago, and I just don't have the strength to get through this. What was a hypothetical worst case scenario has become real, and that reality is much worse than I could have imagined. 

I can’t even watch TV without feeling hurt. Everyone that I see on screen feels me with jealousy and sadness, because they are “normal”. They probably take it for granted, and that’s understandable. My previous experiences with being facially different meant that I never took it for granted. I always felt lucky for what I had. I wasn’t good looking, but I was really close to normal after my surgeries, and that counted for so much considering how I felt when I went through my earlier issues. If I watch a show or a movie that I have seen before, I remember that I was normal the last time I saw it. If I even reminisce about a happier time of my life it always ends up with me thinking about how normal i was back then. My situation is inescapable and thoughts of it consume every waking moment of my existence. 

So now I am faced with the harsh realities of finalising my last weeks or months. Closing down my affairs and finances, and performing the real life equivalent of deleting my internet history. 

At this exact moment I am a coward, and the prospect of actually killing myself fills me with fear. I live in a nation where firearms are rare, assisted suicide is illegal, and the availability of drugs which are useful in suicide is strictly controlled. Any overdose attempt now would be speculative and far from guaranteed. But I feel that the coming weeks will resolve these issues. Each day I feel a greater need to die, and as my pain and discomfort increases then so will the strength of my medications. Once I get hold of the powerful stuff then that will be my prompt to act. This will be much later than I would have hoped, as the desired time has already passed. But other methods of ending my life would be much more unpleasant, and my key concern is that I cause the minimum of distress to others. I know that the act itself will cause pain to so many people, but I hope that in time they will understand why I chose to die. 

I’m sorry for such a long post. Writing it has brought me immeasurable sadness, but at the same time it has aligned a lot of my thoughts. These aren’t feelings which I can share with anyone close to me, but I just wanted someone to know how I am feeling, even if I’m just an anonymous throwaway account on Reddit.

"I don’t want help to make my life better, i want it to end","I’ve been dreaming, imagining how i’m going to kill myself. Whenever i think about this, i feel a sense of calm, finally a place i can rest and all my problems will be gone. Imagine it like you’re driving a car, and the car keep getting faster and faster and you want it to slow down but you don’t know how. You only know that suicide is the break, a pedal that u can press but you car will stop forever. 

I think about what happens after i die, my body, atoms, will return back to nature. The universe will continue normally just like before i was born. I know it’s wrong but in a way i look at suicide as a beautiful thing. Someone, who has been suffering, freed from their pain, resting in peace. 

It feels calm as i stand at the roof. But at the same time i’m too scared to go nearer to the edge. I’m afraid i might actually do it and jump. It tells me that deep down, i know i want to live. As i have these thoughts, i can’t help but feel selfish. I ask myself, “well if you’re so suicidal why don’t you commit suicide now? Don’t undermine the people who actually committed suicide, you didn’t suffer as much as them. You would be so selfish if you committed suicide. You will burden your family and friends with the pain”

Life is beautiful. It’s not just about constantly being happy. The pain, the hardships and not knowing everything is what makes life special. The mystery is beautiful. We fail and we fail but we have hope, goals that we want to achieve and we continue to try no matter how hard it gets. We have faith.

But as I constantly try to move on with life, the more i realise, there is no place for me here. It seems like i simply am not capable of finding anything here. It seems dark, and whenever i run from it and see some light, the huge darkness will always catch up.",SuicideWatch

Addiction,My addiction is very embarrassing to talk about so this may be hard. I have been a sex addict and didn’t know years but then it drove me over the edge one day. So my grandpa died and we had to inherit his horses. They were two big ones one male one girl. Weed and cigarettes fuel my addiction all the time and one day I got too high and made the worst decision of my life and went out the the pasture barn. I would go there and play with myself for ever cuz nobody ever went down there or would even think I would be there. Anyways I was there one day playing with myself as usual and then something hit me I saw the male horse penis and it turned me on. Never even liked men my whole life ever but it was making me excited. I tried to keep my cool and watch the regular porn but then my inner demons came out and I went over and started orally pleasuring the horse. I was so nervous it would get mad or something but the horse didn’t seem to mind. This had a snowball effect on me and eventually I was out there almost every day playing with the horse and having oral sex with his parts. Last time I did this was last Monday longest break I had but I feel like if my urges continue to me doing it again it will be the last thing I do. I’ve already found the thickest rope and plank in the barn where I would do it. I need help ASAP any suggestions or advice?,SuicideWatch
my situation won't and literally can't get better - i'm tired of people saying it will.,"i was going to use a throwaway because people i know irl follow this account, but to be honest i don't really care if they see this. i just need to let this out.

so, i have several chronic illnesses/diseases, as well as severe mental health problems. i am in constant pain every day, both mentally and physically, and many people just assume i'm lying. although my conditions may be rare, they are all diagnosed and recognised by doctors, and they are very real.

i have no way of communicating how much i am suffering. and even when i do, all of the doctors and therapists just say there's nothing they can do.  apparently my constant aching and fatigue is 'incurable', and i'm 'mentally-resistant' to all medications and therapies for my mind, whatever the fuck that means.

if there's nothing nobody can do, what is meant to bhappen? am i just going to have to sit here and wait until this thing kills me? because i'd rather die in peace and when i want, then let some agonising disease do it for me.

my life is awful outside of my mental and physical health too. i am surrpunded by mentally and emotionally abuse people. i am constantly manipulated, degraded and ignored because they know my brain can't stop them. i've tried to reach out for help - i've called crisis lines, even the police. do you know what they did? said i was fucking lying.

i have seen shit that nobody should ever see, let alone a fucking child. 

if i were to 'save' myself, i don't know how i'd do it. a lot of people say that overdoses are a shitty way to go, but that's because they don't know how to do it properly. i do, which is why i'm just waiting for the drugs to come my way. hanging seems unreliable, i've tried slitting my wrists before, and i don't think i have the chemicals handy to kill myself that way either.

when pets are gravely sick, what do you do? do you let them suffer, watch them live their lives in pain because of your own selfishness? no, of course you wouldn't do that. you may love them, but you don't want them to suffer. **why is my situation any different? nobody wants to hear it, but it's true: it isn't.** 

god, i wish euthanasia was legal in the UK.

i can't continue like this. stop telling me i'll get out of this situation, because i fucking wont. **i can't.** you need to understand that. 

i will always be sick.

i will always be in pain.

i will never be able to function properly.

i will never be able to *think properly.*  
so please, please stop telling me that suicide isnt an option. stop telling me it will get better. 

i want to be free from this pain. do i deserve this?

"There is no way a girl could desire me, so a lonely future is inevitable for me. To save myself from that future, I am ending it. Because I dont deserve to suffer.","I am an objectively bad looking guy (see profile), and every girl who has seen me has deemed me completely unattractive, and not even worthy of a conversation let alone a chance to date.

My family have told me that they forsee me being a lonely old man with cats, due to my severely unattractive face. The best I could hope for is an undesirable girl who only dates me because she is lonely, not because she appreciates me.

I go on tinder and get zero matches. No matches at all in the two years that I had the app. That means every girl who saw my profile deemed me too ugly for even a conversation. How ridiculous is that haha.

Girls frequently hit on and sleep with my friends, after they have mocked me for my undesirable looks. My ex who was unattractive and desperate set a ground rule of no sex because she openly said ""I have zero attraction to how you look"".

I have compassion for myself. Which is why I plan to end my life, because I dont deserve to live my entire life completely alone. I am a good person with unfortunate looks, thats it. I am saving myself from hell by killing myself

Best way to kill yourself,"Someone please help me. I’ve battled with this since I was 12, I’m almost 31 now.

Just want to say mental illness is real,"Small introduction, My name is Zack, 23 and I live in a small yet very successful country in south east Asia. I grew up with both my mother dying of breast cancer when I was 3 and dad died shortly after due to complications. Growing up was different, I have 2 elder sisters 38 and 31. Them being way older they are often at different stage of their life and I was mainly alone. Looked after by a very very loving grandma. My aunt and uncle took care of me growing up. Wasn’t always close to my aunt, family fights and I’m always against my aunt. Just some adolescence stuff. Fast forward I met my first real girlfriend. L, she was kind and sweet. Purest of heart, but I ruined her, you see I had issues I didn’t know/acknowledged. Anger issues, possessiveness and even a lil bipolar. She was in an abusive relationship with me. She was my pillar for my uncle’s passing. Uncle was a father figure for me. A very close man that I truly admired. Died due to a heart attack. Fast forward again, I met R, she was funny and really caring almost like a mother. But all good things must come to an end. I broke her as well. I had the habit of hiding truths, I convince myself it isn’t a lie but I am a habitual liar. I lie so well I believe in my own lies. I became violent, I bullied her, abused her mentally and manipulated her. She broke up with me and I finally see myself as this disgusting monsters.

I lost the only value in my life.,"My gf died from sudden exacerbation of her disease. She couldn't call ambulance and I've not even been near her when that happened. It all was so sudden. We talked to each other literally in hour before this happened. No one ever knew that our last meeting was THE last.

It's not only the matter of romance, love and tenderness between us. She was simply the best, the smartest and the most unique person I've ever knew. She was literally the only human in my life with whom I had so much pleasure talking to, to talk about absolutely anything, even before I fell in love with her. I was engaged in self-development, started learning foreign languages and red many books just to be in par with her. She was making me better.

Now she is gone. I did my best for her funeral and helping her parents, and now I'm contemplating the life and find no further purpose in it. It is bleak, boring and full of despair. I just can't do anything now. 

I went through reactive depression, and now I'm recovering, but I still can think of no reason to live further. I'm too weak for suicide, yet I'm thinking of it - even logic-wise, not only emotional-wise -  more and more frequently.

I have not done anything useful with my life,"Since I was 13, I started having problems with self-esteem and depression. I tried to kill myself twice when I was 14, and nobody knew about this. I'm 17 now, and my mind is pretty much the same. 


All this time, the thoughts are always the same: everybody is always better than me at anything I do, and no matter how hard I try, I will always fail. If i start having interest in something, I quickly give up, because i don't even try anymore.

My mind's answer to any major problems in my life is always suicide.

I have almost no friends and spend most of my days in my room, playing or reading. Playing games used to bring me happiness, and just a way to escape reality, but i've got into online games and they have quickly made me more angry and depressed. 

Being honest, the only reasong i don't kill myself is because of my mom. I can't do it to her, mostly because she's depressed too, and she would probably end up killing herself. Another reason i had was ""I want to see what's going to happen in the future"", but that doesn't help anymore. The world is becoming even worse, and the future will be shit, no matter how impressive the tech or something else will be.

I had so many dreams when i was a kid, and they got shattered when i started to grow, one by one. I pushed away most of my friends, and i'm almost completly alone. There's only one person left, and i always count on him to talk me out of killing myself, but he's probably going to leave me too.

So, to be honest, i don't know if i can stand much longer. Probably not, since these thoughts are becoming more and more frequent.

"Landlord is threatening to sue because of damages caused by my autistic brother, just one more thing added onto a shitty list of many. I don't know how much longer I can take it.","We just moved hours away from the town I've lived in for a long time and had friends in. We lived in a nice house and even though it was boring, I actually had friends. We've been poor all my life and it's one of the main reasons I've always wanted to kill myself. I have an autistic brother who I love, I've dealt with 17 years of getting ignored because he needed more attention, getting attacked because he was upset. We could never control him, our house was always a mess, no doctors or anyone would ever help us. My mom had to do it mainly by herself, a 6-foot toddler. Our old house was damaged badly, my brother was constantly throwing things, making holes in walls, all of that. We couldn't do anything to stop him because he would just overpower us, leave us bloody. It got worse at the end, he dumped everything he could find, laundry soap on the floor, a huge hole in the wall from him rocking. He would get so upset and attack me, my mom and my sister, we were scared to get near him.   


We finally got approved to put him into a home after years of them telling us they couldn't do anything. We finally got out of the grasp of my dad and came out here to make a life for ourselves. We warned our landlord what she was getting herself into when we first moved in, she was too busy trying to get down my father's pants to listen. She's been harassing us ever since we moved out. Calling constantly, telling my mom to come up there so she can discuss the repairs. My mom cant, she has to find work, finish college. She sent us pictures of all the damages and said she will sue if we don't pay up, but she doesn't want to. My mom can't pay anything until she finds a job, and if the landlord keeps telling her to come down she won't be able to pay anything.   


I just can't handle this anymore. We've spent all these years having no one believe us, no help, nothing. And now it's just getting worse. I don't see any end in sight and I just can't find a reason to continue a life where all that is being thrown at me is more and more bad stuff. I have my name change in a few days, the only thing that's been keeping me going these past few months, but it's hard being excited about it. I just lost my therapist, I have no friends, nothing, nobody to talk to. I don't know how I can handle this, there's nothing to make it better.",SuicideWatch

Therapy just makes me feel stupid,"In December of last year I think, I got a new GP since I needed someone to prescribe me my hormones. I wanted to discuss getting a new antidepressant as well, so she referred me to a psychiatrist.

&amp;#x200B;

I talked to the psychiatrist in January and, like an idiot, I mentioned my plan to kill myself the summer of that year, which resulted in me being handcuffed and dragged to Emergency Psychological Services, where I was repeatedly misgendered by staff when I wasn't being totally ignored, the only vegetarian options for dinner were bread and carrots, and I was just generally made to feel broken and subhuman. I was let out 24 hours later when I said I didn't plan to kill myself in the immediate future, which is something I had never planned to do in the first place. What I learned was that if I was honest about the severity of my suicidal thoughts, I would be punished.

&amp;#x200B;

After that, I went shopping for a therapist, but none of the ones who seemed like a good fit were covered by my insurance. So eventually the hospital set me up with a psychologist. Our first meeting, she asked me what aspects of my body made me dysphoric and then laughed at me when I included my feet on the list. That same meeting, after I expressed concerns that if I scheduled a vaginoplasty, my insurance would change before I reached the scheduled date and I would no longer have any hope of affording it, she told me it would be possible to get the surgery within a year, which was a bold-faced lie since even the required electrolysis in preparation takes at least a year, and she would know this since she also works at the gender health clinic.

&amp;#x200B;

Every subsequent meeting has involved her trying to get me to talk about my self-loathing and hopelessness and then telling me I'm being irrational the moment I even begin to articulate anything. This is apparently what cognitive behavioral therapy is. When I tell her this all makes me feel stupid, she retorts that that too is irrational since even though I've never had my IQ tested, it's probably fairly high according to her magical powers of psychometric clairvoyance. In other words, I'm stupid for feeling stupid.

&amp;#x200B;

And now my homework is to imagine a set of life circumstances which will make me happy and which I can realistically achieve, which I'm too stupid to do. I've ruined some of the most important friendships in my life along with the only romantic relationship I've ever had with my incessant self-loathing ramblings, and that whole episode of my life ended with me being told to get therapy, yet apparently, I'm too stupid for therapy to even work at all. The only solution I can see is to kill myself, but I can't tell any mental health professional how badly I want to or I'll be sent to Crazy People Jail again.

My brains tells me to kill myself as soon as I stop distracting it,"I've had depression for a long time but it has gone much much worse these past few months. The few friends I trusted abandoned me and left me alone. My girlfriend dumped me and my hobbies are in hiatus because of the pandemic and probably won't come back for more than a year. I feel very lonely and just burst into tears all the time because of what I lost and know I'm never getting back. It feels like something is burning inside of me and it's getting more painful everyday.

I'm trying to hold on. I'm trying to think of anything else. I'm doing sports, playing videogames, listening to music. But whenever I stop doing that, the urge to kill myself comes back. As soon as I'm just sitting there, doing nothing I just can't think about anything else than suicide. I guess I just don't see any purpose to my life anymore, just suffering. I didn't know you could feel despair in such an intense way. But I wish it would be different. I would do anything for it to be different. But loneliness hits hard when you live in a huge city.

Ready,"Hello Reddit,

I'm absolutely terrified to do this, but here we go.  
I've been contemplating suicide for a few years now, but I think today I'm ready. I've gone totally numb and I've began lying to everyone telling them I'm fine. I've self-harmed frequently in the past week. I've began googling ways to end my life, and I think I have a few ideas mapped out (if I don't die from them, at least I'll be in extreme pain, like I deserve).   


Why is is today I'm ready? Well, today my mother had a heart to heart with me (I've been staying with my family post-grad school to save money) and told me that I'm bitter and in a bubble with a smile on her face. Told me I needed to get out and try something new, and that I'm hurting her and dad by choosing a boyfriend who makes me very  happy and doesn't do anything to upset me/tries to be as helpful as he can, but hasn't been in much contact with my family due to distance and the virus. She told me that she needs to get back on weight watchers too (we've both overweight, which is something I dwell on daily), and when I told her that my grandmother had a talk with me the day before about how disappointing my boyfriend is and how fat I've gotten, she just smiled and said ""grandmothers just say things like that, you should know that by now"". She left hugging me and telling me if I ever needed anything to tell her. If I were to tell her I've been considering suicide, she'd absolutely tell me I was crazy. When I told her at a younger age that I felt that everything was my fault, she said I ""belonged in a mental institution and never say things like that again"". 

I can't tell my boyfriend, he's already done too much for me. I can't tell my Dad because he has so much on his plate, and my brother has a good life ahead of him. At this point I feel that there's no one left to reach out to, and I've hit my limit. I think tonight I'm going to harm myself again, and if things escalate, I'm going to take a fistful of my depression meds and see what happens. If I don't die, at least I'll be getting what I deserve. 

I'm sorry that you had to read this, I didn't mean to take up any of your time. I hope that you have a good and safe weekend.",SuicideWatch

He kept telling me that he wasn’t happy with her and that he didn’t know how to end things without hurting her (bullshit lier) he swore he would never tell her because he knew what it would do to our friendship. Well he told her anyway without warning me and now she hates me.

Delusional thought from depression?,"Since I was 12 I’ve dealt with severe suicidal thoughts and self harm. At 15 my mom threatened to put me in a mental hospital and I told her I probably needed it but she rescinded it (she was trying to use it as punishment) and then told me we couldn’t afford it. When I was 16 I was telling her I just want to die. Her and my sister told me I should’ve just done it because always t”hreatening” them with suicide was “too much for them”. 

Now, being stuck at home again, whenever we argue or I just sense they’re upset with me I can’t help but deal with overwhelming feelings that they just want me to kill myself. Maybe it validates my feelings that I still want to kill myself. If anyone has decent online therapy either free or cheap I would really appreciate some help.",SuicideWatch
today is the day.,"I’ve decided this is the day. This is the day I will die.

This is not a plea for help, this is a suicide note.


 

 
My life has never been very good. But I’d say it peaked at around 5. This was before my father had became an alcoholic,  before he became abusive.

It was also before my mother had died. Don’t text and drive kids.


Life was alright then, we were a fairly stable family, not poor, but not rich. 

A fairly happy family, if you will.


I was 7 when my mom had died. I don’t have many memories of her unfortunately. 
My father had gotten into alcohol as a coping mechanism for grief.
I did not do well with her passing. I was upset about it for years, it still makes me tear up when I think about it.

When i was around 8-9, this is when my father started to constantly yell and scream at me. I started wanting to run away, though I never did.

I was fucking  suicidal at age 10.

He started getting more aggressive when I was 10. Now, not only would he yell and curse at me, he would throw things. He would threaten to break things that I cared about. I always had a certain plushie that I was very attached to because it was one of the last things my mom had gave me and because I had accidentally spilled a glass of water because he had scared me, he decided to rip it in half in front of me. I was absolutely distraught. And for some reason this had stuck with me. I never trusted him with anything since.


I am 16 now.  I recently moved in with my grandad, who is the sweetest person I have ever met. He actually supports me and my flaws, my sexuality and me being a furry.

But I’m afraid it was to late.

to everyone who has ever cared about me, for whatever reason,
Please know I am deeply sorry. Please remember the good times we had. Not this.

I Need Somebody to Love on Me,"It has been a hard few months. I was going through a traumatic event before the lockdowns and quarantines began in my country, and the shutdown has made it very difficult for me to manage the repercussions of the accident I went through.

I just want to cry and have a hug from someone who won't yell at me or get angry at me or be impatient with me like all the people around me are. I just want someone to understand my sensitive heart, but it hurts reaching out over and over again and meeting people who just won't get it.

I wish I had someone who could protect me, or at least say they would and mean it. I don't have a family; I have people I'm related to, but they don't get me and I'm over them. I know if I make it through th we times, I'll be happier than I've ever been, but with very little support, I'm struggling to make it through each day. Suicide crosses my mind daily, but I'm always too scared to do anything. Truthfully, I don't want to die, I just want to escape this prison and this isolation. I want to be with people like me, some call it a ""soul family"".

I'm scared,"I'm so so scared. I just feel empty. I have felt like this for so long. I attempted at christmas time 2018 and honestly, I wish it worked. I have no friends irl, all of my friends are online and even then I only have like 3. I only feel slightly happy when I talk to them. I have an overwhelming urge to run away too. I hate it where I am and I hate that because my family are so nice, loving and supportive. I don't want to worry them so I don't tell them anything anymore.

But I'm so lonely. Every single one of my friends have a life, things to do, *friends.* And I only have 3 online friends and family. God, that makes me sound ungrateful. But it's the truth. I don't know how long I can carry this on for. I don't even necessarily feel sad, just empty and numb. Well, I don't even know at this point because I still cry a ton. It jut feels like I'm staring into the sky but there's no clouds or fog, it's completely clear just not blue. When I was depressed last year it felt different, more desperate and painful whereas now I'm just, here. If that makes sense? 

I'm scared though, petrified even. I'm not scared of me dying because I feel at peace with it. I'm scared because I don't want to upset my family. They are the only reason I'm still here and to be honest, I don't know if they're enough to keep me hanging anymore (no pun intended ;) ). I'm scared because of the amount of time I spend a day imagining me running away and never coming back, the amount of time I spend each day writing individual suicide letters to the people I care about, in my head, the amount of time I spend a day planning how I'll do it.

Since I was young I have always wanted to study Science(specifically Physics) as the world around me always interested me and I have always had a want to unravel the mystery's of the universe, space the likes of that. I want to make an impact on the world in a positive way. Leading a normal boring life working a 9-5 office job has become a fear for me as I know it will not bring me happiness and just make me feel as if I am wasting my life(I know some people would like to live this kind of life it just isn't appealing to me). I fear that I have a low IQ, I have never been tested out of fear for a variety of reasons I will get to. This has always terrified me as since having a low IQ means that I will not be able to contribute anything meaningful in any way. Thinking about this has led to what has now become a depressive disorder which requires me to go to therapy. I have dyspraxia as well which has led me to have a bad short term memory. While I have attempted to eliminate things such as bad balance and have been able to play piano up to grade 5 and onward I have yet to improve my memory, back on topic however. Is there anything that I can do to improve my intelligence in any way possible, are there any conflicting theory's to the idea of IQ that might give me some IQ? all would be appreciated please.

I know I shouldn’t,I know I shouldn’t do it over a boy. That it’s stupid. But I just feel so worthless. He was my best friend. We were supposed to be together 4 ever 🙄. He helped me through so much. And I just feel empty. He’s right he did so much for me and I’m just a burden to people. It was all over a stupid argument and it’s all my fault. I already paid him the $400 I owed him. There’s nothing else I owe here. Just gotta clean my closet out and get rid of my things. I’ve already decided on a date. June 20th. It’s when I have to move out - and since I already paid him and I’m worse than ever what’s the point of finding I place. I live for other people. I ruined my own happiness. I have nothing.i suppose I wanted him to hug me when I gave him the money. Or something. Anything. But it’s also my fault since I just handed it and closed the door. Life isn’t a fucking movie.

It would hurt people too bad. At least once a week, I go down and look at my meds, knowing exactly what I could do with them. How easy it would be. How I could make everything go black.

It was quite an emotional roller-coaster as she kept talking about suicides, but I started to not take it very seriously, because she kept threatening it over and over, and each time it did not happen, until it became dull, however, just 2 days ago, I think she really did it, she gave me one last message ""you were very kind {name} &lt;3"" and from then on I have not seen her reply to any of my messages since, and has been completely inactive. She did told me her previous attempt was pills, but she survived, I have a bad feeling about this time. Yesterday I cried for hours on end, it's this loneliness, empty, hopeless feeling, that she no longer exists in the current world, complete dread and despair, she seemed so unique that I feel like I will never meet another person like this ever again.

dumb rant i needed to get out,i hate it here guys i have so many people i love and care about but i cant bring myself to see me worth being happy with them. i get it that everyone has their own worth and deserves happiness but after so many years of being abused and depressed i just don’t see it. i’m trying to be a good person by helping others and being cool with literally everything. i’ve started vaping to help me cope with my depression and anxiety. nothing works for me. i’m not gonna do any hard drugs because i know that’s not the answer but i need something to keep me at a level where i don’t constantly wanna kill myself. i’ve already tried and it wasn’t fun. next time i might do something quicker and essentially painless. i hate being so sad and having a boyfriend who cares so much and all he wants to do is help me feel better. he seems to be the only one that’d care if i die and i could just break up with him and make him upset with me so he’ll stop caring about it. i’ve thought about suicide a lot recently and there’s nothing i can do to stop myself from thinking about it. i want to die. i haven’t taken any actions to do so but i feel like i might later. i feel cruel and evil for having people care about me only for me to die. i tried antidepressants and mood stabilizers and wellbutrin  and abilify work together on me. but the issue is that my mom doesn’t care enough to refill my bottles and so i stopped cold turkey about a week ago and i’m feeling so so bad i need my medicine. i just want to feel happy.,SuicideWatch
I have intrusive thoughts which make me want to end my life and fear I did something terrible,"


I have OCD and it leads to intrusive thoughts and fears that I did terrible things in my past , during childhood and early college.

I’ve been beside myself for the passed few weeks. I think I have struggled with intrusive thoughts my whole life but this time it is really getting out of hand and I’m a total fucking shipwreck . I constantly sit back and worry if I committed a serious specifically sexual abuse with a childhood friend or if I came on too strong with a girl at a college party who I was dancing with. 

I could be completely blowing these out of proportion and overthink them because that’s what OCD does to your brain but here are all the things I have done which torture my brain and constantly need me to get reassurance from other people including you all who I don’t even know. This is like my 10 th post.

1. I licked my friends foot when I was around 10. (This strikes fear that I sexually abused him, even though it was a weird thing I did as a kid, everything is fine with us today.)

2. I was kinda a bully during 11-13 years old. And I feel extreme guilt for it. I apologized too many people over Facebook and they told me not to worry about the past. But I feel a lot of shame for it.

3. I have a childhood friend who I picked on and I wasn’t the only one. I remember as kids we always did weird stuff especially as boys we would horseplay , wrestle , ball tap each other , cheesecurl (stick a finger up someone’s butt as a joke, ) and I think on some occasions dry hump as a joke randomly on each other for laughs. I have been so terrified that I did something sexually inappropriate that I can’t remember and I’m afraid if I sexually assaulted a friend even though the weird things we did were jokes and supposed to be funny. I randomly hit up this kid from my childhood and he told me we were kids and not to worry about anything and that we are cool. But I have a fear that I may have done something bad and that he might not remember it . My brain drives me insane and feel like it plays tricks on me.

4. I danced with a couple girls at college parties but we were all on the dance floor together and I kinda just started grinding with them from behind and never saw their faces. Eventually I made out with both of them but from behind . I made a move after we had been dancing for awhile but I’m afraid that they might have felt pressured or I came onto them too strong and they felt scared and didn’t know what to do. I am not a bad person

I’m losing my mind here I can’t fucking take this shit. 
5. I grabbed a girl I was dancing with butt at the bar. She didn’t seem to mind and she was grinding on me but I just get scared I made her feel uncomfortable we were both drunk. But dancing on each other and it was fun. She never yelled at me or anything.

I am so afraid all the time that I sexually abused somebody or that I’m a bad person and I need constant reassurance that I’m not bad. Most people tell me these things aren’t a big deal and I’m being to hard on myself . My therapist says it too that kids do weird stuff don’t be too hard on yourself and that the stuff in college dosent sound like u did anything wrong. Somebody please help me GOD. I can’t deal with this anymore I wana die from the constant guilt. I wana be a good man.",SuicideWatch

(20F) My debt makes me want to die,"I really want to die because of the insane amount of debt I’m currently in and will be in in the near future. Not only that makes me want to kill myself, I also have nobody in my life who loves or cares about me. My “family” is full of physically, verbally, emotionally, sexually abusive pieces of shit. I have no true friends. I’m currently in an on-off romantic relationship with someone who doesn’t truly love or care about me, but at least it’s better than having no one, right?

I don’t think anyone better will want to date me anyways when they find out I will have over $100k in debt just for undergrad. No, I didn’t go to a private or fancy school. I went to a public university in my state and just fucked up. All for a stupid and useless degree that won’t even guarantee me good jobs because now you need a masters degree for successful jobs, and I can’t handle any more school. Getting bachelor’s degree makes me want to kill myself. I already got my associate’s degree before going to a public university, so no, I can’t go to a community college and take classes for cheaper. I just have to take the rest of the requirements for my degree.

I’ve fucked up a lot in school because of poor mental health. And today I just got an email saying that I won’t be eligible for federal financial aid anymore because of my GPA. So now I have to apply for private loans and will be getting into even MORE debt. 

Oh, and I also have credit card debt. And can’t even keep a job because I get stressed with school and working at the same time. And I can’t take time off of school to just work, not at least for next school year. I can’t get out of my lease for my apartment for next school year so I might as well take classes if I’m living at the school, right?

I already know I fucked up by taking out student loans. My estranged dad who is an abusive POS (but has money) told me my whole life he would pay for my college. That’s the only nice thing he’s ever said to me. I thought he was going to pay me back for all the abuse he put me through. Then when I got accepted to college and was ready to go a month before, he says he won’t pay my tuition anymore because he thought I told family members he abused me, I denied it, and said he didn’t believe me. I literally never told anyone he abused me because I was afraid of him and wanted him to pay for my college like he said. He was just trying to get me tell him if I did tell anyone or not, because he cares about his appearances and didn’t want anyone to find out about what an abusive POS he is. And my mom has enabled it and never spoken up about it and let me become a victim since I was born because she was afraid of him too. The great kicker of this too is that now my dad is fully paying for my younger brother’s college tuition and he goes to the same college I do. 

I just wanted to get out of my abusive mom’s house as soon as I turned 18 so I took out loans stupidly and went to college. I changed my major lots of times, took a year off, did poorly when I went back and fucked up in college. I just seriously want to die. I don’t want to live in poverty and be a slave and work forever just to pay back all of this money for a stupid mistake I made when I was young. I don’t even want to finish school. I have no support system or people to help me financially or emotionally. 

I’ve been researching a lot more lately about a relatively easy, not too painful, quick way to kill myself. I just want life to be over. I seriously don’t see ANY reason to stay alive. I truly have nobody to stay alive for or who would truly care if I died tomorrow, except for maybe my old dog who will probably die herself within a couple years. 

I really can’t go on anymore. I don’t want to stick around to see if anyone will love me. I doubt it will happen. I’m almost 21 years old and still nobody has ever truly loved me in my life. Why would I stick around and wait to see if anyone does while I work tirelessly the rest of my life and stress about debt? My life is so worthless and pointless. 

I feel happy thinking about me being gone and not dealing with the bullshit of life. But I’m also kinda nervous about killing myself because I don’t want to survive. If I do it, I want to do it once and do it right. I don’t want to live or be saved. I don’t want to have to pay back the ridiculous hospital bill. And even if I did get help, what would change? Nothing. My life will always be shitty, because it always has been. And it’s just going downhill.",SuicideWatch

"Planning on going through with it tonight, no backing out this time"," I'm beyond sick and tired of living like this. I want this all to come to an end. What's the point of hanging on when nobody even ur family cares about u? My whole life I've been both physically and verbally abused by my parents. I didn't even have a proper childhood, I spent most of my childhood in my room bc that's where I felt the safest. I have vivid memories of my dad coming home drunk and beating me til I was gasping for air. Those memories still haunt me to this day and what keeps me awake at night. I don't think ill ever truly recover from that trauma. 

On top of that I have no friends. nada. Maybe a few acquaintances but they make it very clear they can't stand talking to me, so I just leave them be. Also I fucking when ppl dismiss my problems and act like I'm making this up. I really wish I was so I didn't have to live through that nightmare. whenever somebody shares their story whether it's about sexual assault, abuse, depression, drug/ alcohol abuse etc, people automatically think they're making that shit up for attention/ want people to feel sorry for them. That's not always the case tho,  Which is why a lot of people are afraid of sharing their story bc of ignorant people like that. 

I'm almost finished with high school yet I barely made friends or went to parties. I can't help but to feel jealous When some people don't gotta work a day in their life and get everything handed to them on a silver platter.  I have to work harder than everybody else to get where I want to be in life as I'm a WOC, This puts me at a disadvantage at life. Honestly this post is all over the place and nothing I'm writing is making any sense. I'm writing this on my bathroom floor crying uncontrollably contemplating what my next move will be. 

It's 4 pm rn and I spent the whole day like this, it's pathetic af to say the least. I'm ready to just give up altogether. I'm planning on actually doing it tonight and I'm not going to back out this time. I heard ODing on alcohol is the least painful way to go, hopefully that's true. Ill finally be free of this horrible ass life. I know absolutely nobody is going to read this shit, so what the point in wasting my time writing this? I guess it helps getting if off my chest idk. I won't be leaving behind much and I'm sure my death would be a wish come true to others. I only have a few hours left so i'm guess I'm done writing here.",SuicideWatch

I had another near miss last weekend.,"I ended up waking up though. So I’m still here. But idk how much more I can take. I’ve lost most of my friends and family since I transitioned. I haven’t even kissed anyone in almost 4 years. I’m on disability and cannot work. My credit is shit. Whenever I try dating, I either get ghosted or “you’re really nice but I’m not feeling it” which is 100% fine. No one is entitled to love or even being liked tbh. 

I just cannot help but think I made the biggest mistake of my life by finally transitioning. My life has only gone downhill since then (about 10 years ago). I hate my body. Even after surgeries. I want more of them. But what’s the point. I first attempted suicide when I was like 10. I was able to drown out my issues with drugs and booze for like 15 years. Before finally realizing what I needed to do to be myself. 

But maybe I should just kms before I end up homeless or worse. Cuz no matter what I do. How much group DBT or CBT therapy I take. How regular I see my psych (currently weekly cuz she’s concerned with my state). No matter how many surgeries I get. Places I travel too. Things I buy. People I meet. Nothing matters. This cloud still follows me everywhere. And sometimes it’s a storm and sometimes it’s just a small cloud. And I’ve been able to ride the waves for a long time. But idk how much more I can take before I just jump ship. 

I’m convinced. Suicide is my destiny. It’s how my life will end. I’ve known this since I was 10 after my first failed attempt. I just don’t know when it happen. And lately. It seems like it’ll be soon.",SuicideWatch

I feel like I want to kill myself,"Seriously, I am just frustrated to tears.  In the last four years my life has completely fallen apart health wise and I can't handle it.  This lock down is just the icing on the cake, right!  Where to begin...

I have MASSIVE health anxiety.  I have OCD so I just stress about it all the time.  Every little thing.  I drive myself crazy and live in fear 24/7.  I hate it.  I hate it so much.  I'm terrified every time I go to the doctor so I just push appointments back and I have no problems I probably need to be seen for but no one knows what's going on anyway....

For starters, my bladder is failing.  Just fucking failing.  I have to pee all the time.  24/7.  Every 15 minutes to an hour.  I never get any fucking sleep and I have to be careful what I eat because anything that is spicy, citrus, vinegar, processed will make it worse.  I have been to Mayo Clinic for two weeks getting tested and no one knows what's wrong.  There is no cure, no solution...  nothing.  Eventually, I'll probably have to get it removed which is terrifying.  The muscles don't work it in...  I have to pee using my abs....  It's maybe really small but they can't even tell, really.  I hate it.  It has ruined my fucking life.  I am always tired and no longer enjoy anything because stuff I did like doesn't work when you have to run to the bathroom every 5 minutes...  in fact, I am so sleep deprived that I can't find pleasure or interest in anything.

What else?  I have massive acid reflux....  LPR all the time.  I have to sleep sitting up and I can't take meds because they make my stupid fucking bladder worse.  I am always suffering.  I'll probably end up with Barrett's esophagus.  I already have massive welts all inside my throat and no one knows what they are or why they are there.  My doctor wants to get a bioposy and I think it's from reflux, one lady says maybe allergies...  who knows?  But they flare up and hurt.

I have seasonal allergies but not like where my nose runs...  more like where my whole head feels like it's caving in and I get massive pressure behind my eyes and my whole body hurts like I'm getting the flu - this happens if I go outside for like a whole day and then I have to suffer for several days until things calm down meaning I can't even enjoy being OUTSIDE during this stupid fucking miserable pandemic.

I just found out I was pregnant in February but I am just such a fucking mess medically and emotionally even and was terrified by this pandemic that I got an abortion five weeks later.  I'm 38.  I'll never have kids now I'm sure.  I killed the one I would have had because I'm fucked up physically and too much of a coward to face what might have been...  

My family sucks.  My brother was my best friend and he killed myself after we got off the phone one night.  I was so destroyed that I drank myself into a stupid every night for the next ten or so years.  My sister is older and a drug addict and alcoholic and she's so much worse than I am or ever was and so selfish and entitled that I can't even related to her or talk to her much at all.  Also, she just says really mean hateful stuff to me all the time.  I can't even repeat it.  My Dad is a total narcissist who never invites me home or makes any effort to see me.  I drove across the country to spend Christmas with him but then he said, ""Let's play it by ear...."" and I was so hurt I ended up pet sitting for someone 45 minutes away from his house for two weeks before turning around and driving back across the country.  I never told him I was there.  He spends all his time doing things for the church.  He's donating everything to the church when he dies.  I could certainly tell some stories about him - but mostly when my Mom got dementia he put her in a horrible care home an hour and a half from my house (even though there were much, much closer and nicer ones) where she was abused and died from bedsores.  She had a horrible death and I visited her every day.  He would go on vacation for weeks and not check in.  Two weeks every two weeks because he needed some 'me' time.  The day she died she howled and cried in agony and I begged him while sobbing to come see her - three days I sat with her and he never showed up until the last hour.  Exhausted I went home and he put some huge post on Facebook about how he was alone with her when she took her last breath and they were together until the end.

The best thing I have in my life is my husband and I love him.  He is the only thing, everything.  The only thing that is good.  I think without him I would have no reason to go on.  And I don't think I treat him as well as I should because I am so angry lately.  I just get so angry and I feel awful for being that way.  I just feel like a big blank slate inside or a husk.  Everything I used to love seems to hold no appeal.  I can't concentrate on anything and I don't know how to get right.  How to get my head right.  I wonder if this is the beginning to dementia, early stages...  brought on by drinking too much.  

Ugh, I hate myself.  I needed to get this off my chest.  I will probably delete this, but it is kind of nice to just say it all...  

I'll add I've seen lots of therapists.  That never helps.  I do the homework.  It never helps.  Bleh.",SuicideWatch
Wanna end it all,"I don't know why but the days have been going so fast this month its really sad. I used to have days where I'd want the day to end but now it really does end fast but I don't mind it at all.

I was thinking of ending it this week, I told my family I was a burden but they all laughed. I'm always in my familys shadows, I wish someone can hear me out.

Sometimes suicide seems the only option,"Hello to anyone who's reading. I am not actually planning on committing suicide. But I feel like things are not going the right way.
The Quarantine fucked me over. I suffered from depression in the past, plus other thing, was very unhealthy and lived a very destructive lifestyle. Anyway I'm from Italy and basicly work in the tourist sector. Had a job but because of the lockdown and the fact that I hated the way they manipulated custumers I left. I think I made the wrong decision. So I'm jobless because I'm idiot. Also started university again but I'm so down right now that I can't even study. I'm applying for jobs but nothing. I used to walk and eat right. Took care of myself and that was one of the things that lifted me out of depression in the past but right now I feel so down and lost that I can't even do that.
I am so scared at the idea of ending up depressed as I was in the past but I feel it happening again and I find myself unable to stop it.
Now that we can move again I don't even have the energy to meet with my friends. Can't even talk with anyone. People all have problems right now. Real ones and me falling back into depression doesn't seem a huge one. Plus I don't want to bother anyone.
And the thought of suicide is starting to cross my mind. I'm not going to do it. But can't see the point in living either if I'm going to end up depressed and wishing upon death. 
Anyway how do you cope with it? Maybe it's just because of the lockdown. But I'm so irritated. I've worked so much to overcome it and in just 2 months all my progress is gone. 
Yesterday I just wanted to cry but I couldn't even do that. I feel like a corps. I mean I can't even cry to get it all out. 
Took some medications, got drunk but nothing. Tried to write it all out and nothing. It seems that I can't get rid of these feelings. 
I'm not even asking for help but I just want to get it all out with people that are going through the same shit.",SuicideWatch

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello, i'm 21 years old and i'm from Chile. I'll try to be brief, but i want to give a little backstory to what's going on with me lately begining with my childhood. 

My life's never been easy probably like most of the people around here. I was bullied by my classmates when i was younger because i was fat and shy *(including some degree of physical violence, not that terrible like most thing i've heard though).* Most of the time my grandfather *(who's my father figure since my father apparently abandoned us and later passed away*) and my mother acted as my emotional pillars as well as teaching me to be nice, kind. Thanks to my grandfather i learned to stay positive no matter what. My mom however is somewhat depressive and tends to lose it a lot *(this also affected me)*. My mom, my stepdad and my grandparents overprotected me a lot as well, so if anything ever happened to me they would inmediatly attack anyone who tried to harm me, sometimes  even when it was not big deal at all. 

2010 and 2011 in particular were very rough years for us. After Chile 2010's earthquake i started having panic attacks like everyday and it was horrible, my parents were having economic problems as well. To make matters even worse, my Arts teacher, who's was my ""main"" teacher that year always tried to make me look like a bad student and a bad boy, even tho most of the past teachers though and said otherwise. This lead to my whole class rejecting me, on top of being unable to shower due to the money shortage as well as the fact i had a fight with my only two friends because of this teacher, which led them to reject me as well and leaving me alone. I spent 2011, 2012 and part of 2013 alone with no friends at all. **During this time i had my first suicidal thoughts and tried to suffocate myself, once. I stopped because my family needed me and i couldn't fail them.**

My life started to recover afterwards and everything seemed a bit brighter... Thanks to my parents, grandmother and specially my grandfather.

My grandfather passed away during mid-2015 and this led me to an emotional breakdown, a horrible and chilling one. My past self started to fade away entirely, no longer being the kind and nice guy. I tried to fill the emptiness with whatever i could, friends, family, videogames, anime, food *(I lost a lot of weight before and after this event i started gaining weight once again).* In the end, i tried out love, and it turned out for worse.. 

To be brief, once again. I became obssesed with a girl i met online who had a bf on another country. I was so overly obssesed with her i even tried to harm both of them *(somehow, i guess).* In  the end she blocked me and it took me a really long time to recover from that event. **I had suicidal thoughts once again, but never tried to harm myself**. Afterwards i sweared to god i would never ever become obssesed about someone ever again... And as you will read soon, i failed miserably.

After this event i had my **first and second gf** (both of them manipulated me and the latter cheated on me). **Nothing really special** here, those relationships just failed. **My third gf** however, was a special case. This was the first person i truly fell in love with and loved. Our breakup hurted me so badly i couldn't get over her loss thus leading me to be in another relationship in a desperate attempt to forget her. This fourth relationship was horribly toxic and lasted two years, including manipulation and some sort of physical abuse from her. I also had my first sexual experience with this person. **This girl changed me because i inherited part of her toxic personality as seen during my last two relatonships.**

Also before this fourth relationship i finished school and begun studying architecture, moving from a small city to the capital, huge change if you ask... caused panic attacks to come back at me. During all those years i struggled a lot with my career, my family as well as the fact that my school friends stopped talking to me entirely after we split up, leaving me once again alone with only my family and distant friends to help me out. Later on i would meet new friends who helped me out all the way until now, preventing me to take some dumb choices of life.

Anyway, right after this breakup i spent several months believing i was finally free and better. This was true and my **fifth relationship** was truly awesome save for one fact... She had a psychological issue that truly complicated our relationship a little bit. We never had a fight, we never had a problem.. but.. i felt that the right choice was to broke up with her to protect both of us, and so i did... I hurted me so much to leave her, **she taught me a lot, i loved her, i was her first irl bf and also her first kiss (nearly first time as well).** We both suffered a lot, but it was for the better and i'll always carry her on my heart.

**And so... with such a huge baggage on my back came my sixth relationship, almost a year ago. This is where my current problems lie at**. I really fell in love with this girl, and to this day i believe she's the love of my life. But my baggage, insecurities, toxic personality and everything quickly showed up and ruined everything. I behaved like a cellopath, controller, and toxic obssesive asshole almost like a psycopath, yes, obssesive, i failed to myself once again. I turned my love into obssesion and harmed her. We broke up, then came back, broke up again and it was all over... I've lost her. She gave everything to me and i didn't gave a shit. **My breaking point came, and i tried to commit suicide once again, throwing myself out the window of my apartment. I just couldn't take it anymore. University, love, family, friends everything felt apart at the same time and made me break. I was... one centimeter away from falling that night, to end it all, but i didn't. I saw my grandfather sitting next to me. He didn't wanted me to give up, and so i did.**

**It was all over?.. No. I begun my seventh (and to this day final) relationship.** I'm not going to talk a lot about this. I hurted this girl, badly like, i truly broke her heart, player around, enforced her to do things she didn't like at all (not physical, only text-based or emotional).  I made her hate me and faulted everything in my life to her, like she was the one responsible for my misery when i was the truly miserable jackass who just couldn't get over his past. 

I thought... my grandfather should truly be ashamed of me, he didn't taught me to be like this. My mother *(then seriously worried i would try to commit suicide again)* would feel ashamed too.

Supported by both my family and friends.. i decided to change, give myself a time to reflex and think. And i found myself, i found that kid who was happy before, even with everything he suffered so far, felt better, became better and got over my past, or most of it... it seems.

When i believed everything was closed up i tried to patch up my relationship with my now two ex-gf. The seventh never replied back, the sixth did.. and.. I realised i still loved her, even with everything that happened, i still felt a huge love and devotion for her, not the obssesive one.

Sadly... she didn't. And i tried to bring her back to me, it wasn't possible. She just couldn't forget what happened and hurted me so much, because my love for her is huge.. but i failed to her. And lost my way because of this, because i was past-driven most of my life, and i lost myself only to find myself and realize the one person i wanted forever in my life was gone. **Last week i thought of ripping my arm open until i bleed out, but i just couldn't bring myself to try such a thing again. I have the means to do it, it's just the fact i'm not able to.** I know my grandparents, my parents and everyone else who cares about me would suffer if i did such a thing, but i barely feel any emotion nowadays, i'm not able to cry anymore, i just, laught out of pain.

Love is obviously the least important thing here, **my guilt is what's driving me insane now.** Having her close is a constante reminder of what i did, what i used to be, how bullshit i was. 

I've been my entire life with psychologist and psychiatrist treatment if you ask.  I just need a helping hand, someone telling me there's something after this, and really giving me a real reason to not give up beside my family, friends and career (I'm not able to find a reason on them). **Guilt is really driving me mad... and i don't know how long i'll be able to handle this before i kill myself.**",SuicideWatch
Cut myself,"I haven’t done something like that in ages. I’m not sad or angry, today, I just don’t want to be here. I know that this little cut will not kill me. I don’t even know why I did it. 

The answer for me is not to seek help. I followed that advice the very first time I was given it. It made everything worse.

That is just a thing that people say.

I’ve even said it too.

I’m tired of trying. I’ve tried everything.

I will never kill myself either, lol.

So what the fuck",SuicideWatch
My family doesn’t care if I live or not,My dad and sister have told me to kill myself and my mom is so obsessed with my stepdad that she doesn’t care about me at all. He is always threatening my mom that he is going to leave and take everything. He has left and taken a lot of furniture and my mom’s money in the past when he didn’t even have a job for months and months. And he is always making my mom feel like shit. My mom started drinking because of him and she is now an alcoholic. Two weeks ago she almost killed herself in a car crash. Today she told me she wished she would have died and that I’m the reason she even went drunk driving and crashed the car. I was just trying to help her get away from my stepdad because he is a piece of shit and he doesn’t deserve to be in my mom’s life. My mom is in denial about all of this and gets really angry at me and blames everything on me when I try and help. My whole life has been an absolute shit show of just trauma on trauma on trauma and I am so sick of living because I know I am so so stuck in life and I can’t get anywhere because I’m too ducked up. My memory is screwed because I think my brain is trying to push out all of those traumatic events and I feel like my family truly failed me. My dad won’t talk to me at all and my siblings won’t either. I cannot talk to anyone because I don’t have any friends. My dad dropped me out of high school and I finally moved to my mom’s house after all these years only to find myself in another hole of hell. I am so tired of trying to be a good person when my family doesn’t even want me to be fucking alive and doesn’t care if I live or not I just don’t wanna exist it’s fucking stupid my family is so narcissistic and selfish I hate them I hate myself and I hate my life. I haven’t cried and felt this much pain before I was so upset that my mom told me she wanted me to move back to my dad’s house that I just screamed and cried and all I can think of is dying.

I wrote a poem about suicide for an english assessment i have so i thought i’ll just post on here as well cause why not,"As I sit in the rain, wet and cold, 
the demons in my head fight for gold.

I watch as the tiny wet droplets fall from above,
and how the wind guides them with a shove.

The rain falls, pitter patter, 
and hits the ground with a splatter.

Oh how I wish that could be me,
but no matter how little anyone cares, 
they won’t let me be set free.

People tell me my worth,
but the only thing keeping me here is the gravity that ties me to earth.

With the evil thoughts constantly churning,
people tell me I need to go to school and keep learning.

But how can I focus if all I feel is hopeless?
Always distracted while others reacted.

The whirling hurricane inside my brain,
presents the everlasting pain.

Breath after breath,
I’m thinking about death.

One day I might commit,
one day i might just quit.

Everyday I hide behind a mask,
hoping someone might just ask…

“Hey are you okay? And what are they?”

Oh those? The marks on my legs and arm?
Well they’re from my self-harm.

This is what society has driven us to,
you finally see what they made me do.

I walk out in the open pleading in silence,

Wish I had followed through.,"Don’t know what I’m expecting, just need to tell this to someone. I’m 21, been NEET apart from a couple dead-end jobs since I was 13. I’ll save you from needless details but this past year has been absolute hell mentally and emotionally. I see no positive aspects of myself nor of the life I live apart from the parents I continue to take advantage of.

After several panic attacks yesterday, I went for a drive to try to clear my head a little. Ended up at a secluded bridge in a small neighbouring town. It was about a 25 foot drop into a very shallow river. I climbed the edge and just sat there, thinking, going back and forth with myself for about 4 hours. Ultimately decided not to do it as I didn’t have big enough balls and I wasn’t even sure if it would have killed me. I know it would have destroyed my parents, but they’d eventually learn to live with the loss of their son.

Do I even exist in the first place?,"It's difficult to present yourself as someone who believes themselves to be unique and lone in their plight when everyone else claims to feel the same way. However, I've been dealing with absolute loneliness for an entire lifetime and have attempted suicide once already, all whilst constantly searching for someone who could've helped me understand my place in this world. It's hard to imagine that there is anyone out there with a similar thought process and state of mind when you've lived your entire life searching for any such person to no avail.

I've lived my entire 21 years alone alongside neglecting parents who've substituted their presence during my childhood with video games that were supposed to fill the void. I had close to no social training during my earliest stages of life, and so the only friends I could've made during my childhood were through the games I played at the time. At school I was only known as the eccentric shy kid that no one would bother themselves with. I grew up playing a lot of RPGs and FF. I remember at a very early age I got my hands on FF7 for the PS, I must've been 8 or 9 at the time. I played that game on and off for years, I don't think I beat it until I was 12 something years old. At that time I had already familiarized myself with the game and all it's characters, I had grown up associating my personality and sense of self with this game and the many others I had played. As time progressed throughout my childhood I only became more and more eccentric and weird considering everything about me was based off video games and a culture no one really understood. I never managed to find anyone I could've called a close friend, and in my later teens I had learned to keep to myself and not open up to anyone as it would only lead to confusion and on my end, hurt.

I feel as if though my life was never real, it took place on some far away land where I grew up happily surrounded by people that were never real. Reality is fiction to me. I am going to die and become part of what was never real, this time for sure.",SuicideWatch

My partner of seven years just told me he’s leaving me. For good. 
That he hasn’t loved me in a long time (maybe ever) and that he’s leaving. 
He’s washing a large portion of his clothes right now. And getting ready to go.....
I’ve given him everything for seven years..... EVERYTHING....... I dropped out of college because of him. I lost my best (and only) friend because of him. My family all hate me because of him. I have given him everything....... And this is how I’ve been repaid...

I’ll be homeless... Alone.... That’s not what I want..... I’d rather just go now......

I can’t take it anymore. I really can’t. I can’t love another person as much as I did him.... I gave EVERYTHING to him........ I lost my virginity to him..... He has been my....everything.......

Why live?,"Why live when even just trying to get a simple means if reliable transportation is so hard?

Why live, when you can only eat what is absolutely necessary to survive, when there is no path towards a better situation in sight?

Why live, when life takes so much, yet rewards so little?

Why live, when the companionship of others is unsustainable or impossible under the emotionally crushing pressures to get by, to just make it through another day?

Weakness is always a burden, no matter the circumstance. 

I can't be strong. I cannot be consistently strong for others, let alone for myself. 

I feel so tired. Overcoming the fear of death seems easier than trying to find happiness in a futile life.

I cannot be a friend, for to truly be a friend requires resilient strength. I try to at the very least be good to the people I love and to the people around me, but that alone seems to mean so little in the struggle for independent security. 

For a person to have to try to carry his own weight, but to also have to develop himself into something of use to society, to have to strive constantly to prove himself. To have to engage himself mentally at all times without reprieve, unable to afford frivulous and hedonistic distraction.

To have to decide the meaning of his struggle, to assign it worth. Even more difficult, to remember that meaning and have the presence of mind to never forget it at all times, because one cannot afford to become unmotivated, which is the direct consequence of continuing anyways.

My mom is knowledgeable of only my anxiety and I asked her if I could take anxiety medicine and she refuses to allow me. She doesn’t understand the pain of living every day. She doesn’t understand that why I am up at 3am is because I’m deciding whether I should live or not. Or having an anxiety attack, or insomnia.

And not too long ago I was here after taking 30 out of 130 pills I had. Didn't die, just got scary high. lol. I hope 200 will work. Maybe this time I won't bitch out 30 in. 

I wonder if I'd be a bit better if my social life wasn't so shit. I have 3 friends. 1... kind of cares for me. She's really sweet but our friendship is surface level and I don't wanna scare her. Another one is too caught up with their own problems and I'm always supporting them but I can't get them to talk to me much anymore.   
The last one is very special to me, but I don't know why. They don't care about me *at all* which hurts cause I have a bit of a crush on them. They talk to me more than the other two do though funny enough.   
I wonder if they would care if I killed myself. Probably not, but it's a nice thought.

"Not suicidal, but I feel as if I am running out of options","23/m, undergraduate non-American engineering student.

I would rather not go into particulars, but this lockdown has been particularly bad for me, making me feel as if I am running out of options. I would like to preface this by saying that my problems are not economical/financial in nature and that although there is no immediate threat to my livelihood, I have been finding it more and more difficult to just keep up. 

My anxiety coupled with depression ensures that I can't do anything I want to in my life. I feel like I have deep commitment issues. I feel like it's difficult to commit to anything: gym, GRE (somehow got a good score without studying much), projects etc. I can't commit more than the first two days for anything long term. Couple that with the fact that I have nobody in my life that I can really ""talk"" to. I have trust issues with my parents, and sure I have friends, but I have always seen them as like-minded people to hang out with. 

I have this morbid feeling that my time is near, even though I have a more than healthy fear of death. I just feel backed into a corner. There are times when I wish that I would jump from my second-floor apartment, I would probably not die, and only end up shattering my legs, which weirdly enough does not seem to be a bad thing. Other times I wish I would get a heart attack, and although it seems improbable at this age (I am not exactly obese), my heart does feel like it acts a bit erratically nowadays (probably gotta do something with how my anxiety and depression is at an all-time high nowadays). 

And then, lets say I scrape through this particular episode, I am afraid that the next one will be worse. Am I to spend the rest of my life like this? What chances do I have of not smashing my brains in the next two-three years? What about when I turn 30? What chance do I have

I feel disconnected from myself and my past selves, when i see a picture of myself i cant recognise him as me, its like a completely different person who just doesnt exist anymore,  lost to time.

I wish i could take a heart attack in my sleep, dead on the spot. I can't talk to my family, and for the past few days have been isolated in my bedroom, and nobody seems to care. My mums advice is always to go on a walk, which is crazy because shes dealt with mental health crises in the past. Im angry thats the response i get but I'm incapable of talking to a doctor  because what would i even say. 

Im gonna cry",SuicideWatch

Meeting the divine intelligence,"Perhaps with death there will be an opportunity to be with whatever cosmic process is orchestrating time. Will it embrace my lackluster soul with post-temporal renewal, or defer it to the next sequence with cold indifference?

The inanity and banality of this life is bewildering. 

""It could be worse"" is terrible logic. The fact that at any given moment, it's possible for things to be characterized by even more suffering is not a reason to live. 

""Well, at least you're not starving or at war."" 

So we keep chewing cud and try not to blow one another up, we work and tell jokes - and like Kurt Vonnegut said, just ""fart around"" until our genetic program runs out of energy, or we run out of oil. 

Great plan. 

""You could be anything!"" said the Optimism. (Except freed from the biological slave machine that must live within a very narrow bandwidth of sleep, temperature, food, and sociality. All bought with subservient tokens. 

Books, films, poems, songs... the artifact repertoire is saturated. How many ways can we say 'this hurts. I want to go home.'   

It could be more beautiful, more wonderful, more amazing in countless ways. And so much of our lives are characterized by describing and imagining how this could be so. And we've moved into this vicarious simulacra of projection into a digital world where it feels like, maybe, just maybe, something interesting is happening.

I want to end the suffering but I find no other way than just ending it all,"Hello.

I just want to tell someone my thoughs here, because i have really nobody to tell my problems.

I'm 16 years old, i live in Germany and i have a problem.

Everything was perfect until a couple of months ago. It started in February. Our schools closed and we had to go in to lockdown. Since that Day everything began to get worse. My parents dont went to work and they started arguing and have a very bad realationship right now. Better said. They are very close to getting divorced. That was not everything. Since a few weeks ago we are allowed to meet in 3 person groups outside. But somehow my Friends dont want to do anything anymore with me. I barely get messages from them and if i ask to go outside they say no. But then i see on instagram their storys how they are outside together.

It is like my life makes no fun anymore. I don't feel the joy that I had before. the last days i just stand up sit on my pc, cry, think and since a few days ago im thinking of ending it all. I just remember every day my failed suicide attemp back in 2016. Back then i took an overdose of pills and then i landed with much pain in the hospital. As i arrived i couldnt breathe anymore and i was very close from getting a liver failure.

I also want to tell my parents my problem and that i want a therapist, but im somehow too scared to break their hearth or making the current situation even worse. I know the worst thing that can happen to them is my death but i really cant anymore.


But i think i will do nothing the next few day nothing. I have no plan yet and I don't want to risk anything. 
I hope someone can give me an advice how I can get a therapist. Without making everything worse

Got called a scammer for asking for help and it feels like I've finally been pushed over the edge.,"I just got out of a crappy roomate situation and have been trying to rebuild my life. I've been trying to stay positive but I've been nearly pushed over the edge 3 times this week. And now apparently I've been reported as a scammer and I kept getting messages about where all I am banned. Apparently a lot of subs including hireawriter... i follow a lot of writing subs to help me know how to write. I follow that one to see what is in demand and now all of these people think I'm a terrible person and I don't know what to do anymore. 

The only people in my life really are my current roommates because my parents got divorced and I didnt want to pick a side and I dont hang out with any friends due to the situation with the roomate. I've been going to therapy at a local charity because it's been so bad but I felt like at least there were options. 

I kept reminding myself it wasnt my fault and it was okay and now I feel like a terrible person and everyone can see how terrible I am and I dont know what to do anymore.

 My life is basically mostly gone. Most of my plants were destroyed... my dog which I spend months training to feel happy again is having anxiety because i couldn't protect her. I had to ask my step mom who only helped me because she could brag to my bio mom for help.

And now most of reddit thinks I'm a scammer.",SuicideWatch

I don't feel safe,"I haven't felt like this in months. This heavy dark emptiness that eats away at me.

""Just a couple of minutes and it would be over"" I keep thinking. I don't wanna feel the emptiness anymore. Right now there's no hope.

Why now? I don't know. Coincidence? Starting a part time job? The appointment with a new psychiatrist Monday that made me think about how utterly ridicolous I am? The prospect of taking meds? Because I have no hope they're gonna work. And if they don't its over. I don't wanna live like this. I don't wanna kill myself. I just wanna die. Stop everything. Maybe this is a bad dream and I'll wake up.

Tomorrow I'm seeing my psychologist. I don't know if I should tell her all of this. What if I am just being dramatic? I WANT THESE THOUGHTS TO STOP TOO. Always second guessing myself. Why. Everything I do my brain finds a way to put in a negative light. I'm tired. I'm tired. I'm tired.

I should message my dad. I don't want to. I don't miss him. Haven't seen him from before the quarantine. I'm a piece of shit. I deserves to die. But I'm gonna hurt other people. I don't want to. I don't want to. But maybe I have to. I'm scared of failing. I'm scared of keep trying to make this work. It's not gonna fucking work.

Suspected BPD. I've fucked everything,"I think I have BPD. I fit most of the DSM criteria but I haven't been officially diagnosed.

I have a best friend who is my ex girlfriend. We are currently on a 'break' from talking because she is struggling herself and I was upset that she wasn't replying to me and her messages were curt. 

I just can't deal with it though. The thought we won't ever be the same. We won't go back to normalcy. What if she likes the silence? What if she prefers me being gone? 

She has suicidal thoughts too sometimes but whenever I ask if she's ok and remind her I'm here for her she ignores it for hours and sometimes doesn't even reply. 

I just don't mean that much to anybody. I've already sorted out any loose ends I'm just waiting until I move in two weeks.

I am in a house that influences and gave me the money for drugs, and set me back. Today I found out that I would be getting my stimulus check so I told my grandma and she immediately says I’m calling the county attorneys office to get you out of my house, the reason being she said she put me down as a dependent and I wasn’t allowed to do that.

I live in a small town and have been arrested once for fourth degree assault, my grandmother came at me throwing wine glasses at me cutting me all to hell. I got arrested that day for assault because I pushed her against the wall to get her off of me, she was in my face and hitting me and I did NOT put my hands on her until then all I did was push her against the wall and said stop please. She called the police right after that and I told them everything that happened the truth what I did to get her off of me and got arrested because they seen a “red mark” on her neck. They posted my picture on Facebook police station and ruined me. I look like a woman beater now, they put it in the news paper and everything. All of my family friends seen that, and it hurts like hell. I’m tired of living, my parents hate me. My grandmother used to gaslight me way before this. I literally had to set cameras up in the house for this shit to stop. It’s a constant fight every single day of my life. I have no car or I would be living in that instead of this place. I guess the county attorney office will call the police and I will go to jail or something for filing the stimulus check. She gossips about me to her friends saying bad things about me, tells me everyone knows what you do to me. She calls me the N word every single day repeatedly right after another in my face pretty much spitting in my face at the same time. I live in her house so the police will just listen to her and she’s the woman. I’m tired I don’t have anything, I did this to

My dog is the only thing that’s keeping me alive. He won’t know where I’ve gone if I left.,"Tired of living. I’m a 22 year old female living in an Asian country. 

I’m honestly not sure if I’m depressed or not because I’ve never been diagnosed. Especially in an Asian country, where having depression is basically taboo or your family doesn’t want to have anything to do with you if you get diagnosed. 

I basically feel like my parents don’t love me at all. They only love my elder brother. Because he’s smarter than me. They’ve always compared me to him and I always feel inadequate. 

I help around the house, I do the laundry, cook, clean but to them I’m just a lazy slob. 

I cry myself to sleep almost every night because I’m so tired of living. Sometimes I feel like I want to commit suicide because I feel my life isn’t going anywhere. I’m 22 but my mother always says when she was at my age she’s already graduated from university and has a job. While I’ve just started University. She keeps saying I’m slow and stupid. 

Not to mention when I got tattoos and my parents found out (back in 2017) my dad slapped/ kicked/ punched/ strangled me. Because of tattoos. He says only prostitutes get tattoos. I wanted to kill myself that day. My mother saw everything happening but never stopped him. When my dad just beat my brother, she would put herself between the both of them physically. But for me? She just stood there and watched. 

I wanted to call the police but she said I would be “breaking up the family”

Right now I’m so tired. I also have been having issues with my boyfriend. I’ve posted in another thread that you can see if you’d like. 

I’m just so tired of living. I don’t feel like anything is ever going to get better. I feel I’ll forever be unloved, and I’ll die alone. I don’t think anyone will ever miss me.

My friends keep leaving me and I can't take it.,"I've questioned my point of living. I'm supposed to attend a graduation party (everyone is showing up in cars.) and to provide backstory, I was bullied relentlessly at my old school. One particular kid told everyone to not be my friend and not trust me. Nobody did anything, so my family moved. I was bullied here, but that wasn't much. It was 6th grade me being a dick. Moving on, about 3-ish months ago I had a group of 3 friends. This one kid eventually kept making stupid comments and around the 14th, he called me a crackhead. I got pissed as they have done this for 2 months. I ended up yelling at him and my friends and questioning them why they wouldn't stand up for me. One of them later said they didn't like being yelled at. I gave them a chance, but the kid who gave the comment, I shunned. Later I texted one of the two friends that they should talk to this kid. She said she would and lo and behold, she didn't do shit. 

I eventually got fed up with the other kid (not the one who texted the kid I yelled at.) because he would always say ""I don't care"" in a way that made him look like he was trying to be funny, so I stopped being friends with him. After that, I left that friend group entirely. Another one of my friends heard about the incident and was on the side of the person that texted the other person to stop. I eventually decided that I should just delete all of my contacts. After that which is present day, I can't stop but have a bad memory of this ""friendship"" seeing as this is the second time this happened to me.

I used to overeat so much i had to me sent to the hospital (wich my parents were forced to do by the school) but I have a shit ton of (untreated) medical issues and some of them prevent me from eating a lot, I can barley eat half a full sized meal. And my metabolism is on a 24/7 rave so that doesnt help.

&amp;#x200B;

Im constantly paranoid and I an never sleep because im convinced theres a an watching me, waiting to kill me. idc about him killing me bt I can see his big ass creepy eyes staring holes into my literal soul.

&amp;#x200B;

I literally unintentionally ruin everything. Im not trying to be depressing I just literally ruin everything

&amp;#x200B;

My parents could care less about me and my mom only cares about if im working on school or not. They dont care about my intrests or passions and only care about if they look like somewhat good parents to my school so cps wont be called.

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever they get cps called on them my mom gets pissed

&amp;#x200B;

when my dad learned I cut myself on a daily (when I was 12. ive been cutting since I was 7) the only thig he said was ""did you at least wash the knife?"" so thats a good representation of how much my family cares.

&amp;#x200B;

My mom is a piece of human trash who uses her illesses to prey off sympathy of others, get wants she wants, and get attention. chronicallyrara is her insta, you can see how much she pitys herself for attention. That skank even uses her illess for good grades in college. she even has a fake (morbidly overweight) service dog.

&amp;#x200B;

Up until this year practically all my teachers said I would never amount to anything and they treated me like shit.5th grde teacher, when I was crying cause a kid called me an ""ugly annoying bitch"" (this is in cali so of course a 5th grader talks like that) the teacher and everyone else saw me crying and the teacher just went ""Everyone please ignore her. Lucy, stop it. Youre fine"" and after I cried more she got annoyed and sent me to the princeples. in 3rd grade I yawned in class and the teacher went ""Wow. Im so sorry that this lesson isnt exciting enough for you Lucy."" and I told her I was just tired (cause I hadnt slept in 2 days thanks to my crippling fear of my mother) and the teacher sent me to the princeples office for ""backtalking and making excuses"" the thing was im pretty ure the princeple thought I had some form of autism? So she was extra nce to me and let me hang out with the special ed kids whenever I was sad, having a meltdown, or being left out of class activities. So, thats nice? 

Im always blamed for literally everything and no matter the situation people always find a way to blame me for everything. like in 5th grade me and a group of girls were learning the whole Indian burn thing, they all burned me so I was the only one who got hurt and I asked if I could do it to one of them and a girl named faith reluctantly let me do it but she didnt like how it felt so they reported me to the principle and I had a week and a half of lunch detention. 

&amp;#x200B;

M grades are literal shit and I have no will to do anything other than art and even then sometimes I dont want to do art. right now im finishing 8th grade with 32 missing assignments from 2 weeks of not working and 29%'s in alost all my classes except 2. my art teacher is chill and she knows what im going through so instead of doing her work assignments she just lets me turn in my art for credit. She also sent me a needle felting kit because she knows I have a huge ass list of art things I want to do and that literally the nicest thing anyones ever done for me. but anyways- with my shit grades and shit work ethic I cant get into a good college wich means I cant get a good job wich means ill end up homeless or working in mc donalds for the rest of my life justlike my mom predicts. 

&amp;#x200B;

oh yeah- ive never had a bithday party- well one that I can rememebr. for my 9nth birthday my mom invited all of her friends to our house and had a party for herself. the people brought their kids, one got to blow out my candles and another opeed my presents (wich I didnt even get to keep cause my mom threw them all away during one of her temper tantrums) so thats nice. I got the bee movie and I really wanted to watch it but I got yelled at for being disruptive (aka asking my mom if I could watch it) so I went to my room and cried and my parents screaed at me because I was an ungratefull bitch yada yada. A thing to note is my parents scream literally centimeters away from my face. its not fun.

I was manipulated into doing sexual stuff by two dudes who were my friends when I was 9. one guy was like 14-16 (i never knew his age) and the other was 12. 12 year old told literally everhting what he had me do but said shit like ""she begged for my dick"" and stuff and then I was harrassed and slut shamed for 2 years until I moved. I only told my therapist about it 3 months ago and my mom got pissed I never told her and my dad didnt seem to care.

&amp;#x200B;

theres a shit ton more but im too lazy to type. that didnt cover halfthe stuff and i sorry if this sounds like an r/thathappened story- I dont wanna say im not lying cause then it really sounds like I am but idk how to prove i not- lmao sorry im being annoying imma yeet myself now",SuicideWatch

"22 F from Italy here. I attempted suicide once and it didn't work, I will try again","I am too ugly to have an happy life. No, I don't have body dysmorphia. My face is asimmetrical, my features suck, I have big nose etc. That's why when I went to school I was always bullied and marginalized. Basically I have never had a real friend. Always alone. I don't have friends even now. I am completely lonely. Well I live with my parents but they work all day long so I spend my days alone in bed. I dont have the strength to get up.  I started to suffer from depression when I was 15 because my classmates used to call me bad names like ""ugly"", ""monster"" etc. Plus I was never invited to join them when they organized stuffs. Then eating disorders, anxiety, self harm, and I attempted suicide once but it didn't work. People told me ""it will get better"" but I am still lonely. Nothing helps. Medications, therapy, nothing. My depression is so bad that I am not able to attend university or to have a job. I am tired to be unlovable, worthless, unwanted, rejected, ugly. I am touch strarved and sometimes I just wanna feel human contact, a caress, a hug, but men are disgusted by me. I have never had a bf, I am virgin and kissless at the age of 22. I know I will never be loved, I will never find a partner because of my ugliness, because I can't change my face. And I don't want to spend all my life alone. So it's better to end it all.

Femoral artery or Helium Tank,"I’m a 22 year old guy and I have a gf (21) I’ve been with for 4 years. We have always thought of eachother as soulmates, and nobody here can convince me other wise so don’t bother. We’ve always talked about marrying and having kids too. When I was a kid though I didn’t think it bothered me but having been molested twice, my father leaving my single mother when I was 2, and always being abandoned by any friend I have, I’m a deeply insecure and immature person. I’ve been in therapy for a month since we separated. We separated because of the following. Because of super high ego and insecurity due to getting into modeling, along with hornyness I cheated on my soulmateI was so disgusted and repulsed with myself. My gf months beforehand got back into smoking pot despite having addiction problems and didn’t tell me about it which now worries me even more. 
It is my fault and mine alone. I regret my mistake horribly and I don’t know what was going through my head. In an effort to grow up and mature, I confessed to her a month afterwards, and that was a month ago now. She was obviously devastated. I told her that I take full responsibility, that I understand her pain and suffering, and that if she’ll allow, I want to show her how much I’ve grown and that it was a one time thing.
Anyway, my gf and I were checking up on eachother till she decided the other day that it may be best to take some time for ourselves and that she’d let me know if she needed anything. So now I won’t really be knowing if she’s safe or not but I also don’t know what’s gonna be going through her mind which scares me. She said she doesn’t know what she wants. I moved out of the apartment and don’t worry I’m still paying rent, we were sharing it with a girl roomate, and I then moved back in with my Mom (who is a surrogate mom to my gf and loves her a lot too)

Even though I’m glad I smartened young and before 30, I feel like if we were to end things, then I lost out on my one chance for true love and a family. My girlfriend and I have lived together for 4 years, talked in detail what we want our wedding to be like and what our kids names will be. I know I’m young but I’m intelligent enough to know that she’s the love of my life, and yes I did a horrible thing but it doesn’t mean I don’t love her with all of my being. I don’t want to be with anyone else and expect them to live up to her. I don’t wanna have kids with anyonelse but her. So yeah, if things don’t go right, I feel like I’m going to kill myself via helium tank. I’m a trust fund kid, so if I died my mom and uncle would get it to retire. My gf would be named heir. And I’d freeze my sperm just in case my gf wants it or my mom wants grandkids, whatever. But I’m terrified of killing myself and what it would do to them, but I’m terrified of living. Most people especially my age hate me off the bat anyway since I don’t smoke, they think I’m “rich” for having a trust fund despite living in an inner city, and for being a little good looking. I want to show them my suicide letters and beg them to forgive me and have a second chance because I’m scared of the future, but then it may be seen as manipulative. She even said as of rn that she can’t begin to appreciate any progress I’ve been making or improvement I’ve had. I’m so directionless rn. I know I can get through not talking to her as much, but if I lose her, idk what I’ll do.",SuicideWatch

I lost 52 BTC (~$500k) over the last 3 weeks and I feel suicidal.,"I'm struggling to type this. I bought 57 BTC in 2016 when it was $650 a coin. This year I had 52 BTC left which were valued at around $500k.

I discovered this bitcoin casino at the start of quarantine. I deposited $200 in bitcoin out of curiosity, that $200 turned into $6.7k and I immediately got hooked. However, my 'luck' ran out when I started losing money. At first I lost $8k, tried to win it back, lost a few thousand extra, promised myself not to come back.

Less than 24 hours later, I deposited $7k extra and told myself to break even and then never look at it again. Lost the $7k within a few hours.

Within this quarantine (around 2 months) I have lost all of my bitcoin and I can't stop, I'm severely addicted to gambling. I even cleaned out my bank account just to 'try and miraculously win it back'. I threw up 4 times over a week because of how much I lost.

I never really planned on making it past 21. Everyone fantasizing about other stuff. Me, fantasizing how to leave. Yet, here I am. Almost middle aged.

Yeah, I have a job and a home. What does it really matter? So empty, no one to talk to. No one asking how your day went. Maybe it's better that way, since I won't hurt anyone anymore.

Not physical, just mental anguish. You might ask yourself why haven't I ended it yet. Hope... Not really. I just fear messing up badly and keep on living.

Got a letter after this semester that said I can’t get financial aid anymore cause I just keep fucking up, spiking any attempt I’ve made on my life comeback. 

I failed out of college in 2016, took a semester of 2 classes and worked a commercial cleaning job for 9 months. Got clean. Got my head in straight. Or so I thought. 

Did a year of school again, fucked up one class, but did ok! Drinking a lot became commonplace then, and that spurred my gap year of school where I basically drank and did drugs and begged god to take me naturally. Begged. 

I’ve been trying to work the 12 steps after gettin Arrested in January. Longest HONEST run I’ve had is like three weeks sober. Just can’t man. Just can’t. 

I have like $1k to my name, two parents who try so very hard to understand and love my distorted brain and provide empathy when they feel able, but I can’t get a handle on this. 

Been in counseling since 2012, and I can’t shake it. All this work and coping led me to the lowest feelings I’ve ever had. I’m only 22 years old, and NOBODY, seriously NO ONE PERSON would ever tell you I’m sensationally depressed. I feel agony and sincere, deeply-penetrating sorrow, and it all seems to come from a lack of hope that I can do this and that I’m capable. And as SOON as I try to convince myself that maybe there is hope! That maybe I can do this, and it’s just been a weird couple years, I BLOW it and wind up here again (mentally). 

The tunnels I speak through in regular conversations and the way silence is the loudest noise I’ve ever heard are becoming exhausting.  

I’m so scared. So I guess that means I wanna be alive somehow. I guess being all the things I grew up scared I would become is something I survived more than something I STILL have to fear. 

I read lots of posts on here, if not all of em. Lots of special people come through this sub, and I’m sorry for taking such space to elaborate my seemingly uncontrollable inward bitterness and malice.

Every morning is such a struggle and I experience anxiety throughout the whole day which has gotten to the point where I am physically uncomfortable almost 24/7.

I have so much anxiety and am so unsure about my future, I know what I'm going to do (as in, my job) but I fear having to go through this day after day. I don't see a happy future, just somebody who keeps going every day because he needs te keep living for some reason. Society doesn't want me to kill yourself but makes it hard for me to get better. 

I don't have any friends and I don't see a future in which I have social contacts either, it feels lonely now and I can't even imagine how lonely it'll feel once I move out of parent's house (I'm 20, in my last year of college). I have so much social anxiety which is fueled by my extremely low self confidence and feelings of inferiority. At this point I have no idea how to act socially, so becoming actually acquainted with someone seems out of this world. 

I'm so afraid of everything, every single moment of the day. I'm exhausted mentally and physically. Right now I'm in bed, it's night, and I feel like I'm going to die tomorrow. Not because I'll kill myself but because I fear going to work so much that it feels like the end if the world every single time.

I feel silly about getting help, my parents don't take my feelings very seriously. I'm just whining about problems which don't really exist, it's not like I'm struggling with living because of having no arms, or having a terminal illness. It's just that my brain is stupid.

She hooked up with a guy a couple days after. After 5 yrs together, she broke up with me to not hurt me and she hooked up with a guy after a couple days to not hurt me. She did it because I had a friend who listened to me. I'm grateful for the one listening. I just wonder if my family or friends would miss me? Or even think about me? Why would they? They don't now. I'm in this hole and I don't have any way out. I dont even want a way out. I just want the earth to consume me and be done with me. Why go on?",SuicideWatch

Is my life worth living? Written by a previously successful child born in 2000,"     The simple answer, NOPE, ITS NOT WORTH IT AT ALL! But, if you don’t believe me, please stick around and read while I clearly describe why you’re wrong. This might be long, but please do read if you have the time, I would very much like to talk to anyone afterwards because I’m in an extra bad place in my head today for some reason.
 
     When I was a kid, I was the smartest in my grade. I got the best marks, I was friends with everyone, all my teachers loved me, it was great. From junior kindergarten all the way until about grade 10 it was like that. I played tons of sports too, starting pitcher in baseball for years, starting quarterback in football, starting point guard in basketball, I always had the leadership position and I don’t know why. I’ve always been on the quieter side, socially, but peers have always looked to me for advice, or help with something, and I enjoyed helping others, so I just kept doing it. 
     All through school I was nominated and elected for things like student councils, student leadership summits, and tons of workshops that only a select few kids from each school would go to. Even though I really didn’t enjoy being apart of these things, I still did them, they made me look good and I did enjoy being able to make at least a little difference in my school community afterwards/during. Everyone always knew me as the happy kid, I was a little shy, but I was always smiling and i always would cheer everyone up when they were down. I remember hearing about depression and stuff like that when I was younger, and I always thought about how I could never be depressed, my life was so good, literally zero major problems, I even remember thinking about how happy I was, and how it definitely would never change.

     For some reason I’ve always been avoiding a romantic relationship. Even when I was younger, I would get asked out by beautiful girls in my class that I even had a crush on, and still, I turned them down. To this day I can’t wrap my head around that, because it happened like a dozen times in school, but now, I’m 20 years old, never had a kiss, never held hands, never even been on a date, and I cry nightly because of how lonely I am. I’m even good looking, that’s what makes me angry, I’m not even ugly, but still I’m a baby when it comes to talking to women, or anyone for that matter. Late last year I did make an effort to express my feelings for a girl, that’s something I’ve never done before. I guess it could have gone worse, but still, I don’t have a girlfriend. She had just been cheated on a few weeks prior to me asking her out, so I got smacked with the friendzone. Which I was fine with at first, I gotta start somewhere, and being friends with a girl is at least a baby step in the right direction. Over some months we got to be pretty good friends, and this girl is just delightful, she’s definitely one of my favourite people on the planet. We have the same sense of humour, both of our faces completely light up when we see each other, and even though I’m on the shy side of the spectrum, I could just talk to this girl forever. She constantly tells me how awesome I am and compliments me, and that’s another thing I’ve never experienced before, which makes me sad because something as little as a compliment literally brightens my whole entire week, and yet I’ve gone my entire life without getting any. She does confuse me though, it’s been about 8 months since I asked her out, and at this point I’m assuming nothings gunna happen, but, SHE continues to make plans with me, some of which are surely over the line for a male/female friendship. Things like cooking new meals together for us to try, making pillow forts to watch movies in, we’ve even been walking thru a park around Christmas time, all the Christmas lights were everywhere, we had peppermint hot chocolates,and we just walked around talking with each other for a couple hours. She knows I have a romantic interest in her, and she actually seems to like hanging out with me, so I just don’t know what I should do next.

     Now onto the source(s) of my unhappiness. I live in a very small town, only about 3000 people, so all thru school we had about 60 kids in my grade, that’s why it was easy to be friends with everyone, because everyone knew everyone. But after grade 10, our high school closed, and the 400 kids in our school were forced to split up across the school board. So I went from living a 15 second walk from school, to an hour and a half bus ride every morning to a school with over 1000 kids, when I was used to not even half that, and I was already shy before that point.
     The next year, I was diagnosed with scoliosis, it’s a spine deformation that usually occurs in pre-pubescent GIRLS, not almost adult males. Normally, a back brace for a few months will help it, but my case was not normal, and my spine curved 88 degrees in 5 months. So grade 11 was fun, my spine was curved like the letter S, and I was in constant pain and had severe breathing problems, so in grade 12, a surgery was scheduled or else I was going to die by my own spine puncturing my lungs. I needed spinal fusion, basically they opened up my back like a set of curtains, and drilled two metal rods into either side of my spine, then they cranked it straight, and stapled me up. It was an 8 hour surgery, and I had 96 staples in my back, from my neck all the way to my hips, which also isn’t normal, most cases are only a small portion of the spine, not the entire thing. I spent 2 weeks in the hospital, worst of my life, then I spent almost my entire senior year of high school at home learning to walk normally again, trying to gain back some of the 40lbs that I lost in the hospital, and realizing that my own family was getting fed up with taking care of me, like it was my fault or something. Before the surgery my doctor told me it would make all the pain go away, only costing a bit of flexibility. Wow what a liar that guy is. It’s been over 2 years since I had that surgery, and I constantly have about a 7/10 on the pain scale, my entire torso hurts. Also, I can no longer bend my back AT ALL, zero movement, I have permanent perfect posture because my spine is now 1 bone. It feels like I need to stretch constantly but no matter what I do, I can’t bend that way anymore to satisfy the stretch feeling. It takes me hours to fall asleep, because all I do is toss and turn, just trying to stay comfortable for longer than 30 seconds until I have to move again to get another 30 seconds. I had to stop hanging out with my friends over a year ago, because who wants to hangout with someone who can only party or have fun for like an hour, then they need to go lay down to recharge. So rather than them slowly begin to not like me because of that, I just stayed home, which I now realize was the worst thing I could have done. I found out pretty early on that the only thing that actually makes the pain go away, besides serious painkillers, is weed. Which sucks big time, because yay no pain, I can actually feel normal, but I have to get so high for the pain to go away, that I’m completely useless. 
     I took a year off after high school to work as much as I could with the pain I still had, and I managed to save up enough to pay for my entire college tuition. I started college last September, and now it’s May and I’m dropped out of that. My parents didn’t want me to move away because of my back, so I settled and went to a college in the city closest to our town. That hour commute every morning combined with sitting in a terrible chair for 5 hours was just awful, made my back pain even worse, so again, I started just staying home. Because I stayed home, I got terrible grades for the first time in my life and it sucked.

     I really don’t like living anymore. I hate waking up, I hate going to sleep, I hate everything I do throughout the day. And it’s a shame, because before Coronavirus lockdown, I was JUST starting to be more confident, I was making an effort with girls, and I was feeling like I could handle actually hanging out with my friends again, I miss them so much. I was taking care of myself, getting some more energy, eating better, but oh no, now no one can see each other any more, and now you’re not allowed to leave your house, so I’m trapped in my room for even longer by myself, alone, once again. Now, what do I have to look forward to? I’m only 20 years old, there’s so much of my life left still, yet I know for the rest of my life I’m going to have this awful back pain constantly, with no way to feel normal again. Yeah pain is bad, but say I stop caring about it and live my life normally, oh wait, society isn’t going to be the same when lockdowns are lifted, and I already dropped out of college, so I have nothing moving forward. I’ve tried hundreds of hobbies, just searching for something I’m passionate about, but nope. I’m good at all of them too, I have fancy oil paintings that I’ve done, 3D printers, tons of edited videos, working design files that I designed myself, hundreds of drawings, books and stories I’ve written, knives and weapons I’ve forged from scratch, cooking, playing instruments, and a crap ton more, yet all of it means nothing, because it’s just sitting in my room. So now I’m just some partially disabled virgin renaissance man, and that’s it. 

     What makes it even worse? My problems aren’t even bad compared to some people’s. I’m complaining about practically nothing if you compare me to someone whose been raped and abused for example. Yet all I think about is not wanting to be alive, so how sad must those people with real problems be?:( So now I figure I’ve hit the point where I have 2 available options, move somewhere far away, and start my adult life on my own, where I can be myself and start fresh, oh wait, that option probably isn’t as easy to do any more and never will be easy again, so let’s take a look at option two.

I'm sorry,"Hey
I'm sorry to bother you all because I really hate complaining about myself. I've always been told that if you're unhappy everyone will fly away from you and I guess that is pretty accurate. I'm also sorry if you happen to spot some mistakes cause English isn't my native language. And this is gonna be quite long so I don't mind if you don't wanna read this🙂
I've always thought about suicide, even at the best parts of my life, I guess the thought was there and it never went away. I realized early I wasn't like other people, and I'm not gonna give you some details about it, but when I was 10 I just somehow realized that other people's brain would work slower as mine (not to be pretentious, it really isn't something I wanna brag about because I wish I has a lower IQ), and that other people wouldn't think about death and violence in the same positive way as me. 
Truth is I have weird thoughts, and I seem to work in a weird way. I lie, quite often, I do some things not politically correct, like cheating on a person I really love, and I do not feel any guilt about it. But I do feel guilt, whenever I, for instance, don't take a friend to the restaurant they would have like to go. And I guess that is because I have a high intellectual potential, like all the emotional drawbacks that come with it.
Or maybe it was because of my mum. Because she never bears any responsibility for anything she does. She opens a door, knock her head in the door, and yells at me, telling me I'm a slut, I don't Care, I'm a whore, I'm an egoist bitch, when I always tried to protect her from the people who would talk in her back and from men who'd tried to abuse her. 
Yeah, let's talk about men. I am a second choice to men around me, but strangers and older men would just try to abuse me in any way they could. Like my best friend's father. Eh, I couldn't tell anything, don't wanna tear their family apart. Plus he didn't touch me that much. 
Truth is I don't care. Well, I didn't have much sexual experiences, but I never felt aroused by them. Though I watch much porn. But I guess what I am really attracted to cannot be spoken out loud for it isn't acceptable in our society. So yeah, I'm not gonna act on it, I'm not gonna speak of it either here, cause that's not gonna help me in any way. 
Now let's talk about this year. I went to the top college in my country, but I didn't like studying science. I was kinda forced into it but I can't find the motivation to work. So I don't get good grades and everyone is disappointed in me Cause I've always been Top student. And I feel like no-one cares about me. Like, people I like are the only thing I care about in this world, and they just keep telling me all their problems but won't even bother to remember one single thing I told them. And that's how it was with that boy, first time I ever had feelings, he was, like, so good at everything, we were best friends and then more. But I just lost all my confidence and started to act weird and he left me. And I don't know, I messed everything up, I'm not worthy of everyone and I can tell they don't give a shit about me. 
And I just feel like life is pointless, and it won't do anything to anyone if I leave. Sometimes I just crave, like physically, for a blade through my lungs or my wrist. But truth is I cannot even cut myself properly because I'm not strong enough.
And I've come to a point that everything I'mma do is gonna make me puke.And that hurts so much when I'm breathing. 
I'm sorry I'm such a mess, it doesn't even makes sense and I probably missed so much things. But hey, thank you for reading all this.",SuicideWatch

Every part of my body is wrong, everything from my giant head all the way to my giant feet. I will never get to be normal, I will never get to just be myself or even like myself. I get to spend the rest of my life being a public freak or a closeted freak, in both cases I still hate how I look completely. 

For as long as I can remember now I’ve wished I was born the other sex. I can’t remember a birthday where my wish wasn’t that I would wake up the opposite sex the next day in a body that doesn’t constantly displease me. 

I remember at age 10 my first suicide attempt where I held a kitchen knife to my throat for half an hour and tried to push it in. I remember wanting to just be dead so much and having this base instinct not let my hands do it. I tried and tried to over come that instinct but I couldn’t, my hands would just lock up.

I hate being alive I hate knowing I’ll never like how I look, how no matter how hard I try I’ll always be the wrong sex. I hate how even though I know suicide is the only answer I still can’t force my hands to do it, I still can’t get past that base instinct.",SuicideWatch

1. If you can get covid 19 more than once, a vaccine will be useless against it.  If antibodies don't work after getting sick, why would they work after getting a vaccine?
2. This is being used to control people, and everyone is buying it!  Not saying there's no virus, but people are way too afraid.
3. We should not let the pursuit of saving lives (noble as it is) ruin the lives of those who are not at risk.  It is unfortunate that deaths are occurring, and I have the deepest sympathy for those at risk and their families, but we are stopping others from living to prevent a few from dying.  Doesn't make sense.
4. If what they are saying is true, this will never end.

I am a statistic.,"There is no face to my tragedy. There is no soundtrack to my suicide. No crowd gathers, no relatives mourn: I am nothing.

Since 2016, my life has steadily become less and less tolerable. Minor issues turning into gaping flaws, like a crack slowly spreading across glass; I am unsure if they could have been stopped (likely so), but in either case it seems insurmountable now. I have lost my inheritance, lost my father, lost my health, lost my laugh -- everything. I have lost almost everything.

I sometimes dream of a new start somewhere else, far from the baggage of it all. I often return home and immediately become incensed, breaking things and screaming. Sometimes, it makes things feel better; in other instances, it only causes a scene. How I loathe my life.

There is no point to this post. I've made five or six just like it, across various accounts. Sometimes, it has been a passing bit of anger, and in others I was sure that I would kill myself sometime soon. For whatever reason, I keep staying here.

I wish it would just happen. Quickly. My life has no value, and my legacy will be that of another faceless casualty, shown in abstract on a graph of ""rising suicide rates in America"" that makes the rounds in the news for a day, and is then promptly forgotten thereafter.

I feel very miserable. I’ve felt this way for a long time. I met a girl, my best friend, who made my life much brighter. However, I disappointed her, I’m afraid, as I tend to do. Our relationship won’t recover, I believe. I have no other friends; no texts, no messages, no calls. What’s the point? I know things can get better, I know that. I know that I can do something about it, I just don’t see why. Have a good night, everyone.",SuicideWatch
I'm going to do it,I can't deal with all the uncertainty. My stomachs been weird so I'm sure I've got bowel cancer. I'm not going to go the doctors to be told that I've got two months to live. I don't want to hurt other people by me being sick. so I'm going to take another overdose,SuicideWatch
I feel like my end is near,So I will make this short. I feel like my end is near because I am not sure if I will pass my college classes. If I don’t pass them than that means I am out. I work hard but it seems I still struggle in some parts. Why I don’t want to get dropped out is because this specific college is literally my best opportunity in life and I will never have a better option. So If I fail I would probably feel like an abomination and a failure. I also don’t want to be NEET and this thought of failing makes me depressed and suicidal. Lastly I am really bad at socializing. I have never had friends nor any girlfriend. Relationships seem like something from another dimension for me. Maybe I don’t have courage to end my life rn but I know that the time is near and this makes me sleepless.

Now I die,I have a gun and it’s pointed at my head I’ll pull the trigger after my pizza gets here and we’ll eat i it but I have no reason live here anymore. I’m not wanted by people in this world I’m 21 and been in multiple friend groups and it’s all the same I get no voice of my own and they can treat me however the fuck they want. People are fucking cruel too no help or sympathy but I learned that at a young age I never had any moral support even from my own “friends” people don’t care their biased and will fuck you over. If you have friends leave them immediately because they will screw you over and it will be too late people are terrible no nice people exist and the same applies to me I’m a scumbag too. I don’t want to be alive all people fucking do is try to expose you and then cry victim when you call out their bullshit and then gang up on you.,SuicideWatch

Trapped.,"I attempted suicide by asphyxiation not too long ago. I tied something around my neck and tightened it until I could hardly breathe, but I panicked once I started seeing black spots and quickly untied it like an idiot.
I'm back to cutting again now, and every day I think about killing myself. My boyfriend tells me that if I kill myself, he'll follow me, and I hate that. It makes me feel so terrible and guilty. I don't want that to happen.
I'm even considering breaking up just so my death and disappearance will hurt him less.
I've just quite simply had enough. I'm tired of being alive, and I don't see any other way out of the suffering I'm living with. Stuck inside all day every day, in the room I got abused in.
I just wanted someone to listen. I can't talk to anyone around me about this, because they'll just guilt me, or I'll make their lives worse than I already have.
I'm going to kill myself before my 22nd birthday in June.",SuicideWatch
Suicidal from Narcissistic relationship...,"Hi all,

Not able to elaborate too much on background right now (really sorry, I'm quite drunk) aside from just wondering if there is anyone else out there who has been left feeling suicidal following a Narc relationship (6 years, we don't live together - he lives with his ex  and she has never been told formally about me and I feel like such an idiot for putting up with this for so long) - I'm still in this relationship supposedly, though I am currently being stone walled (for the past week) after a few really toxic weeks full of arguments and insane behaviour where one minute he was seething and literally described me as ""the enemy"" and then telling me he ""loves me very much""... I really just want it all to stop, I can't see any other way out - this has made me feel like I am the insane one and I don't recognise myself anymore, I just want the pain and confusion to stop. But I am too scared to die a painful slow death via overdose and then have to explain to my family and too scared of failing my attempt to jump and leaving myself permanently damaged but still alive. I feel so pathetic...

Sorry, I must sound like such a self obsessed loser in this and I'm not sure what i'm trying to achieve except maybe hoping someone might have got through a similar situation and might be able to pass on some hope that things get better, because right now I feel so lost and hopeless that I just want it all to stop. 

Thanks to any/all who take the time to read this",SuicideWatch
I'm starting to have suicidal thoughts. What can I do besides calling the hotline? (I'm in the US),"I have a lot of stress going on and I've been having thoughts of just ending it. My wife is the only reason I have to not do anything stupid.

I started a new job, and it restricts what I can do with my time outside of work. I fear leaving the house due to needing to be available if they call me in. If I go anywhere, how fast can I go home, change into work clothes, and then go into my workplace? I'm not on call, but I'm required to come in anytime they call me to work. I feel like I don't have a life anymore. I feel like it belongs to my employer.

I just found out I'm a type 1 diabetic. I can't afford to lose the health insurance that I get through my employer, and due to constantly needing to be available to go into work, I can't learn any kind of skill that would allow me to get a different job. It's not like I can sign up for a college degree if I'd need to bail mid-lecture to go to work when they call me in.

On top of that, I had to buy a car in order to get this job, so I'm invested to the point that, if I were to be fired, I'd go bankrupt before I could get a new job. (And I'd be in some deep health-trouble since I wouldn't be able to afford insulin during that time.)

I feel like I'm drowning. I really want to just let myself sink, but it isn't just me I'm living for anymore. My wife is diagnosed with clinical depression and requires medication for it, so I can't exactly let her know I'm feeling this way.

I used to have a serious issue with just wanting to end it all back in high school, but I got some help through a therapist. That's impossible now since I don't have the option of scheduling appointments due to my job.

My job pays well. Really well. It's one of the best paying jobs in my area. I just don't know if it's worth it anymore. I don't, however, know of anything else I could do.",SuicideWatch

Devastated dealing with loved ones with depression,"Sorry English is not my first language so please kindly pardon my mistakes. I’m currently living with my girlfriend who is suffering from depression. Well her mood is really inconsistent as she could be in a really good shape for two weeks and suddenly breaks down on really small issues. For example she was cutting my hair and she accidentally cut herself. I was playing chess online as she told me to keep my head down. my head was in the game and so I didn’t act quickly about the cut. She then said she felt like I didn’t care about her. Even though she said she accepted my apologies yesterday at night, but she’s still not feeling happy today. When she’s depressed she would only cry but is not willing to talk to anybody. She sometimes told me to leave her alone only to accuse me of not being by her side a few minutes later. I honestly don’t blame her for this at all, but it kind of messes with my head also. I’m being really cautious when I’m around her, my heart would skip a beat if there’s a slim sign of her being unhappy. I kind of do everything she wants me to do so I don’t have much time doing the things I want to do or working on the things I need to work on. As a result, I could only work on my things after I put her to sleep everyday. So I recently would go to bed until 4 or 5 in the morning. Also I don’t have much expectation or excitement for plans we made, as she would sometimes change her mind about certain things and I can’t say no.  I’m scared to make plans for myself as I don’t want to leave her alone. I love her so much and being in depression is not her fault, but I don’t know what I should do moving forward. 

By the way, we are from China and only moved to US last year for school. She started having symptoms about 2months after we arrived. At first we thought it was because she was under a lot of stress for a financial risk management exam. However after the exam she still didn’t feel better. Then we thought it might be because she met some obstacles with finding an internship, but after finding the internship she still didn’t feel better. Now she thinks it might be because the cultural difference and the language barriers and is really looking forward to going back after we graduate but I don’t know what to think anymore. She reached out to mental health consoling and was under treatment for some time. But she said she didn’t feel comfortable with it and it didn’t help much. She is indeed doing better than December and January when she was at her worst, but it’s wearing me off I don’t know how long I could hang in there without breaking down. I would appreciate your advice and replies.",SuicideWatch

I couldn’t even tell my therapist the truth depth, I can tell her I have thoughts sure, that they linger - always.

"My earliest memory of what ""suicide"" meant","As a kid there were things that I sort of knew without knowing them. Like I knew who my father was without actually knowing my father as a person or I knew a concept like lying was bad without knowing why it is and why I sometimes do it.

I think I knew what suicide was from very early on as a little kid but I never knew what it actually was until later. I remember learning the first I recognised it as a thing with actual force which can affect me when I went down a Wikipedia rabbit hole and landed on the Absurdism page. 

I was 12 at best and somehow found my way to philosophy texts on the Internet and reading about how life has no meaning and what not. There it's discussed that Suicide is a ""solution"" to the inherent meaninglessness of life. And somehow this spoke to me. 

Being a kid with no attachment to family or religion or friends or community I could see for the first time that someone else actually felt like me and hell they even have academic essays discussing things similar to how I feel. This was the first time I actually imagined what Suicide was and why anyone would do it. 

A year later was when I first had my first suicidal thoughts. I would say they were trivial seeing as I was mostly fishing for attention at the time but its ten years later now and they've persisted. Of course I can say my more mature brain has a better understanding of that original text I read as a kid and how suicide wasn't actually being proposed as the Final solution to anything but I still wonder whether my younger self was more in tune to how I really feel to only see it as THE solution. 

Right now I can't tell whether it was a good or a bad thing that I found about suicide in the midst of the bursts of loneliness and despair I felt as a kid. I don't know if learning of it in a better context like a counselor would've prevented me from being where I am now. 

All I can conclude is that it was quite the rush to actually find words to describe how you feel especially as a kid and it's hard to find new words to replace them the more you identify with meanings of those first words. Thanks for reading this.",SuicideWatch

all because a new state equipped multi team of 2 **Psychiatrists acknowledged my previous mental illness diagnoses but didn't include it into my new assessment,**

It has sent me into a spiral of obsession and I have been very anxious regarding the removal as I know I suffer with mental illness. I  visited my general practitioner yesterday and he said ""yes technically you still have OCD"" but it's not enough for my mind, I'm still obsessing. My GP has still included OCD in my medical history report but the psychiatrist has not. IF they acknowledged it, does that mean i still have OCD or mental illness? yes or no? yes or no??? fucking help

My mind is going crazy telling me ""well what if I don't?"" What if I never had it? What if??????!"" WHAT IF ALL OF THAT SUFFERING WAS FAKE, WHAT IF i never had mental illness and am crazy, what if i can no longer use OCD as an example to describe to people as to what i suffered with, what if, what if? what if? what if? what if? what if? what if?

My dad told me to kill myself,"\*first-time post\*

(14 year old female, btw)

So this happened yesterday night. I wasn't doing very good mentally, and I ended up barging into my parents room to ''talk'' to them. I was angry so I was being rude(I am taking full responsibility for this). The topic was something mundane, but my parents were watching a movie and they ended up just yelling at me to get out. One thing that they kept saying was that I was making too much noise, so after my dad slammed their bedroom door in my face, I was beginning to have a panic attack. Remembering what they'd said about making too much noise, instead of going to my room, I went to the living room which was farther away from where everyone was sleeping. Now when I have a panic attack, I usually cry, but I don't make a lot of noise. I also wanted to be more safe than sorry. So I'm sitting on the couch biting my arms so that I don't make any noise while I'm crying. Over the last week or so, I'd been feeling depressed again. I thought that I'd gotten over my depression, but I feel like a failure for falling back into it again. I talked to my therapist and and I tried to cover it up by talking about my anxiety instead. Talking about my depression is very hard for me to do, and I really thought that I'd put it all past me. I didn't want to tell anyone about it because I don't like causing trouble and I was worried that my parents would get exasperated. Neither of my parents understand my depression/anxiety, so I just felt even worse. I mean, they got me a therapist but they don't *actually* understand what I go through, if that makes sense. A thing that my mom does is that when we get into fights she says that I play victim in front of my therapist and that I actually ''have it so good here.'' That makes me feel really bad about myself and it makes even more difficult to talk to my therapist about my depression.

Anyways, this panic attack brought all those feeling to the surface and they all burst out. Around 7-10 min later, my dad came and started yelling at me to go back to my room. I said ''go back to watching your motherfucking movie.'' I was still crying so then I said something along the lines of ''you don't care do you! I've been hurting myself for weeks!'' and then my mom came and then they started yelling at me about how I treat them like crap all the time. Then they tried to ''listen'' to me, but it always turns into them listing everything that I've ever done wrong. My parents were like ''why didn't you say anything/why were you lying to your therapist'' And I tried to explain but my dad was angry because ''he pays a lot of money for you'' and he basically only cares about my depression when it affects my wallet. So then my dad started yelling at me to go to my room and I didn't reply because when I go into a panic, it's hard to move and talk. My dad proceeds to grab me and throw me on the ground. This triggered even more panic in me because in the past I was abused by my mom(she doesn't anymore) and my dad knows that. He even promised me that he and mom would never hurt me again. SO this scared me so I started screaming and me dad dragged me to my room by my arm(I was on the floor) and slammed me against my bed. I was temporarily dazed from hitting my back and head against the wooden frame/edge thing on my bed, plus I was on the floor. Then my dad stomps or punches me really hard on the back which leaves me dazed for a sec while he slams the door and leaves my room. I start screaming hysterically because this is triggering all sorts of memories. For context, my dad is 6'3 and very tall, so I was unable to defend myself. My mom is shorter than me, and if it was her I would've fought back. The shock, pain and panic made it impossible for me to fight back against my dad. 

I got up and went  back out of my room and was shoved in once again. My dad screamed in my face several times and at this point I was seriously scared for my life. I tried explaining to my dad how I was feeling and he accused me of bullshitting, and that I was ruining the whole family. He then goes ''go kill yourself then.'' as if  nothing I was feeling was even real. I was so scared and I wanted to call 911 so that I could leave and get away from him but he took my phone and wouldn't let me call. He said I only wanted to call 911 to get him arrested. So I was shaking and in a daze and he kept screaming in my face. My mom tried to get him to stop but she was preoccupied with my two younger brothers, who were crying. At this point I gave up and tried to look for something I could use to cut my skin. I couldn't go to the kitchen to get a knife because my dad would beat me up again. I only had safety scissors which were useless. I did have a nearly full bottle of emergency anxiety pills, but no water to swallow them down with. I tried very hard to  cut my skin with the scissors but they didn't work. I remembered that I had a razor so I grabbed that and was in the middle of deciding weather cutting my leg or arm would be easiest when my mom came in and basically talked to me. She tried to help, but she wasn't doing a too good job of it. Most of the conversation was what I did bad and if I knew the consequences of saying ''I'm gonna kill myself'' as if they thought I was bluffing which I WAS NOT. She then goes to describe the great life I have here, completely missing the irony of the situation. I could tell she genuinely wanted me to calm down and relax and make me feel better, but again it just was everything I did wrong in a nutshell. 

This affected me really bad because I've been working on getting over the years of emotional and physical abuse I suffered when I was younger, and then my dad goes and says that I'm ungrateful, everything is my fault, I'm what's wrong with the family....Now those thoughts have resurfaced up again and this time I know it's true. Because my dad also has depression and he KNOWS what saying those things do to someone, but he didn't care.

I don't think I can give it more than one more year.,"I've been alone for 9 years this month.  I don't know what's wrong with me.  Nothing is ever mutual.  I'm told I'm one of the best friends people can have.  My personality is apparently amazing and I have more friends than I can count.  But nobody ever wants to be with me.  

I get told to ""travel more"" and shit, but I'm too stupid and disabled to do that.  I can't even drive.  I can't talk to strangers.

Well what the hell did i expect.,"So I had a bad again.
For many reasons.

I found out she ordered 100% natural ""antidepressants"".
They're so fake anybody could see through that.
Its an "" essential oil"" pedaled my an MLM or a pyramid scheme in our country.
So I think she just will believe the internet before doctors.
So fuck what did I hope for.
Actual help from doctors? Nahhhh take this shit I found on some blog.

Also my mom was making homework with because because I think she felt like torturing me I don't know.

But she just screamed at me for the smallest reasons.

Like : unreadable word 1 minute of screaming.
Mumbling 5 minutes of screaming.
Constant pressure and I felt anxious the entire time.
No breaks.

So it was 5 hours of learning little to no breaks.
And most of the time you're being screamed at.

Try to not think of suicide.
Its impossible.
I'm quite surprised I haven't made another attempt or better did it.

I just hate both of my parents and I bet my death that they're gonna blame it on teenage hormones.

Like lady you scream at me and when I hate you its not your fault?

Fuck this my birthday is approaching and I want to kill myself on it.
I just can't because my cat actually loves me.

Serious inquiry: Adults only. I am looking for some painless suicide methods please.,"Hello Reddit. This is a throw away account for privacy purposes. I apologize in advance for any bad grammar or spelling. I am typing this quickly from my phone before I lose the nerve to ask. As the title states I am looking for some painless suicide methods. I am not looking for comfort, or to be talked out of it. For most people suicide is a permanent solution to a  temporary problem, but that is not the case for me. I am a 34 year old woman and it isn't going to get any better from here. Years of childhood trauma and then abusive relationships did set a nice foundation for my depression, but despite that I have tried to keep hope. I even got married to a good man in 2019. I truly love him, but I feel like he would be better off without me. He is such a good person and deserves someone better. I know it would hurt him if I died, but the years of happiness he will get from someone more deserving of his love outweighs that pain. But that is just one of many reasons I want to die. I contribute nothing to this world. I am stupid, obese, and I can't have children. I am truly worthless. I just want to die on my terms.",SuicideWatch

"About to give up, just found out my mother with alzheimers never loved me","I'm 15, Female. During the pandemic I look after my mom and everything to do with her when my dads not home (giving her food and drinks, making sure she's okay). She's advanced to a stage where she can't talk properly anymore. 

For the past few weeks I've been feeling extremely suicidal, before the pandemic I was already so depressed that I was missing weeks of school, and there was nobody at home to force me to go so I'd just stay at home with my mom. My motivation for work is severely lacking to the point where I'll feel like crying just from looking at work I need to do. So right now im months behind school (not even including all the work they've set online during the pandemic)

So the other day I thought ""I'll just do all of my work for art, because that's something that I don't need any of the months of lessons to be able to do"". And I started writing down all of the things I need to do.

Skip forward to today. I went downstairs for some reason (I think to ask him to help with my work) and we ended up talking about my mom. And I mentioned something about how she always used to play with other kids but would rudely refuse to play with me. I said it was probably because her alzheimers was developing.

This is when my dad hits me with a bomb. When she had me, she had postpartum depression, and because she was stubborn and furiously independent she refused to get help with it or even acknowledge there was anything wrong with her. So, she never became attached to me, and then she started developing alzheimers. So she never started loving me.

My whole life, the one thing keeping me sane was that at least I knew that my mom loved me. Because my dads become depressed and irritable recently and it seems like he hates me sometimes. And I've just found out that she never loved me, at all, for any of my life. 

She used to push me into walls when I was little, and blame me for everything, and always take my brothers side in arguments. I don't even know how to ride a bike because she'd always refuse to take me out to do it. And I always thought that it must've just been alzheimers. But all of this was back when the only signs of her alzheimers was that she'd forget her keys sometimes. So she just hated me. All my life I've thought she loved me, but she hated me. 

And im just, struggling to see the point in living in a world where I don't even have the chance to have a connection with her. If she just hated me then I could try to fix it, but I can't because of her alzheimers. I just... Its all too much for me.",SuicideWatch
"One question, why do people act like it ever gets better?","It won't. I have been bipolar as fuck for 6-7 years now and nothing fixes it. It just gets worse and worse until I die. But to be fair I do deserve it. I am definitely a piece of shit who should kill himself, so it isn't really a bad thing. It just sucks you know? It would've been so much better if I wasn't born in the first place but unfortunately for everyone here I am. And it's soooooo selfish of me for killing myself if I decided to do it right? Because it's not like I have thought of anyone else but myself right? That's why I want to kill myself right? Because I'm a selfish bastard. Sorry for posting this, I just wanted to get my thoughts out. Don't waste your time trying to help me, it won't work.  Sorry for being born.",SuicideWatch
How to hold on when no advice is helping?,"I don’t really know that I should say that I’m suicidal, as I don’t have a plan or anything. I have entertained certain ideas, but never made a plan to actually do anything. But I feel I would rather be dead, and I say to myself that I want to kill myself, although I don’t really know that that’s true. It’s not that I want to kill myself. I’d rather die of some random medical issue or accident or something. But seeing as that is unlikely, it crosses my mind that doing it myself would be the only way. 

My mom died almost two months ago, and she was my entire world and whole life and best friend. Her death was completely unexpected, and it has ruined my life. I no longer want the things I used to dream about, the things that normally would have gotten me through hard times since I was so looking forward to them. But she was so looking forward to them, too, maybe even more than I was, and that makes it impossible for me now because I don’t feel I can do them, much less enjoy them, without her here with me. 

My pain is so great that I don’t think I can bear it. Every day is miserable. The fact that I will never see her or hear her or hug her or kiss her or laugh with her or be able to tell her things just makes me feel panicky and miserable. I don’t think I can live much longer without her. Everything feels utterly pointless and hopeless and meaningless. 

I don’t feel like a burden. I don’t feel worthless. I know there are other good things in my life. I just hurt too much, and I don’t want to live without her. I’m just ready to be with her again. All of the usual things people say don’t help me. I know it’s not what she would want. I know people love me and would miss me. It’s just not fair that I lost the one person I needed most at a young age. It’s not fair that I will most likely have to live longer without her than with her. It’s not fair that she was taken for no reason. She was happy and was not suffering. I can get no comfort, no matter how small, like some people are able when their loved one had been sick or suffering. 

The only things that really have stopped me up to this point were that it would hurt a few key people in my life and my religious beliefs. But those things are holding less and less weight for me as I go. I’m starting to feel almost disappointed in myself for still being alive. 

My therapist says the way out of depression is to give it time and “fake it til I make it,” but that doesn’t make sense to me. I’m perfectly capable of going through the motions. I’ve been doing it. But that doesn’t take away the pain. Besides, it’s not the depression that makes me feel this way. It’s the grief. And I know that will never end. Everyone I’ve talked to says that it never goes away, you just learn to live with it. That’s just not a life I want to live. I don’t want to hurt and feel this way forever. 

I just don’t know what to do. How do I survive when none of the usual things people tend to hold onto mean anything to me? Thanks for any advice.",SuicideWatch

2 hours to go.,"I’ve been putting this off for a while. I don’t know who will bother to read any of this, but I won’t be at peace until I write out what’s on my mind and throw it out into the world. 
Last year, I was arrested on suspicion of R (you can guess what I mean by that, I don’t want to be taken down by the auto moderator). The victim, was an ex girlfriend of 3 years, and I’ll tell you what happened. 

One night, we had a party among friends at her house, and a large amount of alcohol was consumed - I don’t even remember most of the night. The only thing I do remember, is everyone going to bed and the two of us alone, downstairs, on the couch. It’s all very foggy, but I recall initiating sexual contact with her consent, but I also remember at some point she seemed unconscious, and I soon realised something was wrong, immediately panic went through my head, and all I could focus on was that she wasn’t awake. I remember vomiting and crying, I went to the bathroom and had a panic attack. When me and my ex girlfriend were together, we were very liberal, very anti-R, pro-communism, that kind of stuff, and I was so stricken with grief over what I’d done, I couldn’t stand it. I didn’t mean to, I really didn’t. I came clean the next day, over the phone, I couldn’t bear to look at her face, and she reacted horribly. Posted everything all over social media, and it caught the attention of many people. We were a well-known couple in the area, being together for so long at such a young age, a lot of people looked up to us and aspired to have a relationship that seemed as wondrous as ours, so naturally it accumulates shares in the hundreds.

I confided in one of the friends that were at the party, and they seemed understanding at first, they seemed to accept that it wasn’t my intention, and tried to make reparations, to no avail. She cuts off contact with me, I attempt suicide a couple of times, and I get into a relationship with my best friend at the time a couple months down the line. In March, I get a knock at the door, a good few months after the incident had passed. It was the police. I was arrested, and taken in for questioning. I didn’t know what to say, at all, the officers dissuaded me from having a lawyer present and the evidence was fairly damning, every last bit of evidence was self-incrimination, confirming what had happened and how much I hated myself for it, even though I didn’t mean to do it, it still happened, and that weight was a heavy one to bear. By this time, my ex/girlfriend of the time had helped tremendous amounts, she reinforced the idea that because consent was established beforehand, and I hadn’t realised, I’ve done nothing wrong. I still felt like I had done something wrong, but it was far less burdening for me. I was subject to a very brutal line of questioning, I tried to tell the detectives that I couldn’t remember almost anything, but they insisted I remember, or I’ll most definitely be thrown in jail without a leg to stand on - so I made things up to get them to stop, I was extremely scared, I’d never been in that situation before, so I tried my best to fill in the blanks with something made-up. Although, the interview ended with me crying and begging that I don’t know, I don’t remember, I didn’t mean to.

I was charged 2 months ago. I’m awaiting trial. My solicitor seems positive, but before my plea hearing, I had a barrister tell me to plead guilty, because I am most definitely going to prison. I pleaded not guilty, because after that moment, any hope I still had left, died, and the only reason I pleaded that way was to make preparations for my suicide. For the longest time, my life has been a constant loop of police interaction, talking with my solicitor, getting arrested, talking with my solicitor, getting calls from my solicitor to write some sort of letter thing with him to the court, having this stupid fucking situation catch up with me at every corner, drinking to absolute nonsense levels and throwing up in my own bedroom most nights. I’m getting fucking tired of it.

I’ve tied many knots in the past couple months, but it has never worked, so I settled on a better method. It’s against the rules to say what it is, but it’s far more silent, a lot less painful, and very easy to make. I feel ready to leave, I’m not sticking around, just to go to prison for 10 years and come out of the other side unable to live any sort of life at all, just because my dumb-ass younger self wanted to show off and drink way too much fucking buckfast and smoke far too much green at a get-together. I’m not doing it. I’m going through with my plan in 2 hours. 1AM is the time my stomach should be completely empty, and I have the highest chance to leave. I’ll be sure to engage with everyone as much as possible, answer any questions and such what, as long as it follows the rules of the sub - that’s if anyone’s even here, I doubt anybody really cares anyway, not that it matters.

"Intrusive, dark thoughts","Hello everyone - firstly my thanks for reading. It’s a very difficult thing for me to post in here. I am not really ready to share my background and full story up to this point, but needless to say it’s been a struggle for as long as I can remember. I’m a male, in his 30’s, in good strong full time employment. 

As a child, I suffered a number of traumatic times that had a knock on effect on my life to this very day. I have anxiety issues that are spiralling out of control, and am now going through a divorce. 

Since before I was a teenager, I’ve had unwanted intrusive thoughts of the darkest nature to do with killing myself. I have no thoughts of harming another. 

The thoughts seem ever present, but stronger when I am gripped by my depression and anxieties. I will fantasise about killing myself, plan how I would do it, work out ligature points, have sudden thoughts of driving off the road, cutting etc. They just suddenly enter my thought processes and take over. 

Afterwards, I’m left shaken and left with this strange suicidal hangover. I’ve always been good at dealing with them, but they’re becoming increasingly strong and more frequent. For the first time, I’m genuinely fearful of what I may do to myself. In moments of clarity, I know I don’t want to die. But in those dark moments, it’s all I can think about. There is less and less light these days. 

Does anyone else have this? Is there anything people did that worked? I’m due to see a psychologist, but we’re talking about well over a decade of bottle up issues that I just cannot put into words. 

Thank you, stay safe.",SuicideWatch

nobody knows me.,"i will always have mental illness. i have been suicidal for what is years now. i have also had severe anxiety since i was 10ish. nobody really knows what i’ve been through. i remember crying on my bedroom floor of my dad’s house, isolating myself as my dad and grandma would shout and scream at eachother. i remember being molested by my ex best friend in the room next door. i don’t live there anymore, but now i have other problems.

last year i came out as trans. i stopped caring about my education around then. people would pretend to be my friend. boys at school would tease me. i pretended to be like them, but i wasn’t. one boy said he would fuck/rape me because i’m trans. i could feel people judging me, that’s why i was scared to attend classes. even though i never let it get to me. people just put up with me. i hate my body too. all i do is hurt myself. 

when the pandemic happened, i was happy school was over. then the online work crept up on me until i gave up on it. i don’t care about school when suicide is my escape route. what do i have to care about? i can’t even imagine going back there. i hope i die before they can save me. i hope i die before i can get worse (if that’s even possible). i hope i die before i go back there. but if i don’t let it get to me, why do i want to die? i don’t know, it’s just mental illness taking over me finally, what it’s wanted to do my whole 14 years of living. 

sometimes i like to act out to make someone care. say that i'm going to kill myself when i don’t actually have the things to do it, which sucks. i hate everyone’s bullshit by the way. “you have so much to live for” “you’re so young” “it’ll get better” shut the fuck up. you don’t know me. i don’t care how much you invest yourself in me. leave me to fucking rot. the world is ugly, let me die young. then you can cry about it. i’m not even living, i’m just existing.

Feel like I can’t express my suicidal thoughts,"I try and talk to people but when I speak it just sounds so stupid to myself
I’m just so tired of existing",SuicideWatch
The thought about having a normal life.," 

I am born with a syndrome called klippel-feil, and I am starting to really hate it.

I feel like No matter what I do, there is always problems regarding my physique or how I look, and the problems is always my fault. All the things my hart is burning for, I can’t do 100% like everybody else. Everything is always half \*\*sed.

Since I was little, all I ever wished was to be “normal”, I’ve wished it so hard that I almost was ready to die for it. Since I was little, I always felt that people was/is holding back from getting in touch with me, or even talk with me… thinking, is something wrong with this man, why is he looking like that… 

People sometimes laughs or look funny at me when I’m just doing normal stuff like just walking like everybody is, so I almost never go out, or doing something with other people, in fear that People will laugh or be rude and the whole situation will be awkward.

I can talk if there is a subject at work, but if not, I froze, close down completely - Feeling I have nothing to share. I am hopeless.I have limited amount of friends (at least I have 1 or 2, which I am grateful for),

Have no girlfriend, Never had a relationship with anyone - probably because of my bad looks.  
I went on continuation school, “normal” school, and still I talk with none of them (is it my own fault?).  
I have tried to committed suicide 2 times in my life, every time people is just

talking hard to me how I have no respect for others… Seriously, I have respect for other people, maybe more than everybody else, But I just have a complicated life, which is so messed up.

I am honestly thinking about suicide every day, wondering why I am still here. It’s starting to take over my job, more and more I can’t think clearly. Always I’m ridiculously slow at my work, and colloquies is making funny jokes about it.

People always talk about my quality of work is poor, probably why I have been fired from my last 3 jobs. When people around me is talking, I feel hopelessly alone, like I have nothing to share or talk about.

Maybe this is just how it is, I have to accept all of this. Actually, I love life. I just don’t love my life.

How can I get out of all this?",SuicideWatch

Ambulance workers and doctors keep mistreating me,"I just posted another thread, but I need to get this one off my chest, too.

I had a massive panic attack week+ ago. I tried to call helplines, but I was so panicked and in hell, that I hardly understood how to write numbers into the phone. I kept missing numbers and screaming in desperation for some number to please work since I was losing it BAD.

When I got the number written down right, the line was stuck. I tried several times to reach someone but the helpline did not become un-clogged and I was not getting any help. This is the first time this happens to me. The situation escalated to me butchering my hand with scissors, I just stabbed it to shreds and had to call an ambulance.

When they arrived to look at my bleeding, non-working hand they were just dismissive and cruel to me. Treating me like I'm stupid, told me that I should've called a taxi instead, completely disregarding that I needed a professional to calm me down. I was helpless and this piece of shit who was supposed to help me just treated me like trash, still having a panic attack and bleeding.

They brought me to the emergency room and the nurse I met there was super nice and told me the first responders were unprofessional and to dismiss their shit. She made me feel so much better.

But I didn't even get to see a psychiatrist, and I was released to go home while still disoriented and out of this world. I could not find the door outside and spent 15 minutes confused about doors. Finally a nurse helped me get out, but I had no money with me and I had to figure out how to get home in a confused state and feeling abandoned.

A friend ended up getting me home.

My hand is still fucked. It's just one big bruise full of stab wounds.

Last year I hurt my foot while having a panic attack and the doctor treating me kept mocking me ""Oh, what a good idea to hurt your foot, I bet it helped your mood haha"" and when I yelled at him ""You do NOT treat me this way!! I'm here to get help and your shit attitude is not helping!"" he then got really annoyed for me not just kindly complying to his shit and he ripped my foot to his lap and started mangling it painfully to punish me for talking back to his shitty ass.  
I tore my foot away from him and he yelled at me ""You need to let me investigate your foot!""  
And I held my ground, I yelled back at him ""You DO NOT treat me this way!""  
He tried to again violently grab my foot, but I pulled it away and told him he can look at it if he'll be nice.  
There were nurses in the same room. They were uncomfortable and afraid. They sat on their chairs kinda looking away at their toes, dis-associating.  
The nurses ended up fixing my foot and they were kind to me.

But it's just so extra depressing to know that when I try to get help, I still have to fight to be treated like a fucking human being. Even the medical staff think I'm a bother and a waste of time. I can't trust the first responders or doctors to talk me out of self-harm or suicide. Even they want me to rather die.

The feeling is mutual. I wish I could piss on their graves, but I'd need to live another 30 years to be able to, and it's not worth it to stay alive.

I fucking hate people. I fucking hate life.",SuicideWatch
"I used to say that I didn’t want to die, just to stop existing","Not anymore, now I want to fucking die as fast as possible. If I had any possible way to kill myself that wasn’t extremely painful and not very unlikely to work, I’d do it. GOD IM FUCKING FURIOUS, BOTTLING IN ANGER, ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION DOESNT TURN OUT VERY WELL, WHO KNEW. 

I literally have no reason or excuse to be this fucked in the head; my parents aren’t abusive, I mean they have great intentions and I’m definitely not an easy teenager to raise; I have friends. I HAVE NO REAL REASON TO BE SO FUCKING SUICIDAL AND FRUSTRATED WITH MYSELF. I’m just so angry and I feel like I’m bound to a life of frustration and disappointment, and you know what? I really don’t want to wait around to see that happen.

ADD and amphetamines (Meds for ADD) reallllly fucked me up, shit sucks I guess. 

Just wanted to spill it out on text, if someone reads this, maybe I’ll feel slightly better?",SuicideWatch
