I'm not sure how to approach and navigate the current situation that is happening with my sister and her fiance. Please share what you would do in this situation. I'm seeking legal advice and emotional advice. Even personal advice/experiences. A different perspective maybe. I'm just trying to figure out how to navigate this situation.  I want to be there for my sister but I want to do what's right as well.   


Situation:   


My mom basically gave my sister a guilt trip today because she never goes to visit them. My sister didn't visit them at all during the holidays last year. No visit for either of their birthdays or Mother's Day. Even though they live only 20 minutes away. My parent's never see her.  So in retaliation to that - my sister contacted my mother today and sent her a picture and told her that the dresser fell on her and that's why she wasn't coming to visit for Father's Day. The picture she sent was of her face. In the picture she has a huge busted up lip, swollen nose and looks like she will have two black eyes soon. After some interrogation from my mothers end (because my mom didn't just fall off a turnip truck- she knew that wasn't from a dresser) - my sister admitted that it was her fiance that did it. They have been living together for several years. Maybe 8 years or so.   


Her (my sister) current stance on the situation is that she is fine. She does not want to leave him.  She does not want the police involved. He is ""not that kind of man"". He feels bad. He's been saying he needs counseling like he's had in the past. His temper just got away from him. Sometimes he sees red. He asked her to call the cops on him after it happened. He wanted her to go to my moms house for the night after it happened.  (These are all the excuses and things she has told me and/or my mother today.) She also said that there was not alcohol involved. It is hard to know what to believe from her though. She also let it slip to me that this ""hasn't happened in a long time"". So even though she told both of us it was the first time this has happened - that was a lie. 

&amp;#x200B;

Full Picture/Background info:   


Some background information about my sister. She is a recovering alcoholic, maybe active (not sure). 34 years old. She has no children. She was married for about 18 months in her early 20s then divorced. She started drinking in her early 20's and went downhill from there. She's always had social anxiety. ""Chip on her shoulder"" persona throughout her entire lifetime. She has a few DUI's from her really bad days of alcoholism. She's been in in-patient rehab facilities. She's told me that she's also a sex addict. She is also bulimic. She's told us she's been raped before. She used to go out a lot to bars and I think there is a lot of things that have happened to her that we don't even know about. A lot of legal things with her life she won't tell us. She bottles things up a lot. I'm not sure if there are any other drugs involved in her life or her fiances life. I know they smoke cannabis sometimes. And I think she is still drinking. She was talking with an online therapist on talkspace off and on within the last few years but she doesn't do that anymore. Her and my mom butt heads a lot because my mom tells her how it is all the time. Last time things were bad with my sister - it stressed my mom out so much that my mother swallowed a whole bottle of pills and was rushed to the hospital to have her stomach pumped. So my mom can't handle this new situation that has now arose. My mom's psychiatrist (from the last drama time) told her she had to distance herself from her daughter, (my sister). And that is now what my mom will try to do again. She won't be able to handle seeing Robyn stay together with an abusive partner. My dad is kind of like me. He's upset about it but doesn't know what to do.   


The ""fiance"" (man that beat up my sister Friday night) has a ""car salesman"" type of personality. He always drives her around when she needs to go somewhere. He's always the one talking when they are together. Robyn is never around my parents or myself without him there. It's almost like she's using him as a crutch. At least this is what I thought of their relationship in the early days. He isn't someone I ever imagined my sister being with. But my sister has changed so much since we were kids. SHe's not the same person anymore. She hasn't been the same since she started heavily drinking in her early 20's. They live in the middle of nowhere Oklahoma. I don't know a whole lot about him. He is the type that will lie and spin the truth. He grew up in a different small town in Oklahoma. He is around 33 years old and has 2 daughters of his own. Both of them with a different woman other than my sister. My sister actually works with his mom at a laundry mat. And even though they are only 20 minute drive from my parents. My sister never goes to visit my parents. (I personally live in Florida. I've been living here since February. Before that, I lived in Germany for 5 years preceding. So I've been physically very far away from all of this.) I flew to Oklahoma just last week to visit them all. I hadn't seen my parents and my sister in almost 2 years. I just moved back to the states from Germany. Now I'm able to visit my parents and sister much easier and quicker. I swear last week when I hugged my sister for the first time in almost 2 years, that I could smell alcohol. If you know someone that is an alcoholic - you know that smell that the skin and pores releases. 

&amp;#x200B;

What to do now?   


So when we first got the real truth about what happened. Of course my mom and dad were ready to get a gun and go after him. Then the next thought was -  to call the police.   
But then we have my sister asking us not to tell anyone, asking us not post anything, asking us not to call the police or to call her fiance. (Which she called her boyfriend today-- which I noticed that she didn't refer to him as her fiance like usual.) We have evidence on our phone of what her face looks like. And her admission to what happened. She was careful not to give too many details about what happened too. She said she didn't want us reporting him so she didn't want to tell us. I did get from her that it happened Friday night and that it was him that did that to her face. And that it was because of stress from money and he ""exploded"".  I tried to convince her to leave him. To move in with me. But, she didn't want any of that. My mom told her she was buying her a ticket to fly her to Florida to stay with me. She didn't want that. Didn't want to talk about it.  She's been saying she's fine. And it's not a big deal. She's asked me not to think about it. She's been saying contradicting things to me all day. For example she said he ""barely drinks"". Then she states later that he doesn't drink at all. Then also she stated that she had a safe place figured out for that night he beat her that she could have gone to if she needed to. But then later she says that she feels completely safe with him. If you have to even think of a safe place - you do not feel safe.   


So my question is -- what do I do in this situation? 

Does anyone know of an organization that I can connect my sister with so she can get some professional advice? I think she would be open speaking with a therapist, maybe.

The person in question isn't my ex rather than my sisters and the father of my nieces. Over the 11 years he's caused my family a  ton of trauma. 

*This is a long one. 
Back in 2012-2014 my sister would have horrible anxiety and panic attacks to the point she would have to go to the hospital. During that time he would slowly become an alcoholic and cheat on her with minors.
He was 21 and the girls were between 15-17, he was wasted when he told her. He also raped my sister which caused her to become pregnant. (It was nonconsensual she had no choice but to have sex with him because he was wasted and she didn't want him to snap) 
He also once walked in on me while I was in the shower when I was 13ish but everyone seemed to forget.

During those years I was in and out of the hospital with her, keep in mind I was absolutely depressed and suicidal. 
I once had to fight him off because he trying to take my niece while he was drunk. 

In 2017 they had a big fight (We all live together to save money)
he was also hooked on cocaine. He was trying to take my youngest niece which was 3 at the time. As I was running down the stairs carrying her while he was chasing me to get to the other room to call the cops. I slipped on the last few step, the baby was safe since I was fast enough to prop her standing up. Me on the other hand wasnt I had a sprained ankle. 
He accused me of throwing MY NIECE to get back at him when HE was chasing me.

In 2018, he was so out of it. Me and my mother had left to mexico to visit my grandmother since she was dying. My dad couldn't go since he had a stroke shortly after the 2017 incident. My sister kicked him out and he would sit outside for about an hour being absolute lunatic.

2019 was the final straw.
My sister went out after work and he completely lost his shit. Banging on my door asking for her. I had no idea where she was because she didn't tell she was going out.
The next few months were one of the most traumitizing moments of my life. I believe I got ptsd. 

He retaliated by crashing their car, threatening to kill her and take the girls from her. 
Then he got a restraining order placed for a year (Sister, nieces, me etc), can't be near our house or anyone within 100yrds. He gets to see his kids every sunday but my sister usually trails along because she loves him. 
A whole bunch of stuff happened from october - december he supposedly got clean so no coke or alcohol. 

Now 2020: 
He moved to an area nearby and got kicked out twice, then he moved again to napa (If you have can find any articles for an armed robbery in the contra costa or napa area please send it me! I believe it was 4 people) He and his friends robbed somewhere and they split the cash unevenly and he got jumped by them. 

Now in may he moved literally 4 blocks away and he has a gun illegally. My sister talks to him everyday, he drinks again and he's verbally abusive towards my nieces. The older one told me he constantly yells at them for no reason. My niece told me that she fears for her and her sisters life and she doesn't want her life to go back to what it once was. She said that their mom just sits their pretending as if nothing is wrong. My sister doesn't want to give me a copy of the restraining order.
She's in denial that it's abuse, if you have any articles that I can send to her to prove her wrong. PLEASE send them to me. 

If anyone has any information on what I can do (I'm in california), to help my nieces let me know. I'm currently 21 and unemployed, I don't know if there's much I can do.

I spent 3 months at his house and it was great in the beginning. He was so nice, always complimenting me, spending time with me, doing things for me, etc. towards the end though, things got bad again. He started using drugs, being emotionally and physically abusive, and forcing me to do everything around the house. Any money I had would be taken away from me to support his drug habit. He stopped being interested in me and wouldn’t spend any time with me. I felt so alone and the fact that I couldn’t go anywhere made things so much worse. It finally came to a head when he woke me up one morning demanding money. Somehow he had figured out that a friend from Guam had sent me $50 to renew my I.D. He must have unlocked my phone while I was sleeping with my fingerprint and gone through my messages. I could tell that he was sick from not having his drugs and I refused to go get the money for him. He proceeded to beat me all over and pull me out of the bed by my hair. I screamed for help and after kicking me in my abdomen a few times he left me alone. I managed to pull myself up and lock the bedroom door before he came back and hurt me some more. I was genuinely afraid that he was going to kill me (I’m very petite and he is very big, 6ft.10 and 300 lbs.) I was laying on the bed trying to recover from the beating when I heard a knock on the door and a voice saying “Police! Open up!” He had actually called the cops on me! When I opened the door I was grateful to see an officer who had helped me in the past and knew that my ex had a history of abuse and a problem with drugs. As I was leaving with the officer I passed out. He had to call an ambulance and I was taken to the hospital where I was admitted and kept for observation for that day and night. During the attack, he had given me a concussion, a black eye, and caused bruising to my kidneys. 

Once the doctor determined that I was ok to be released, they realized that I had nowhere to go. They contacted the local domestic violence shelter where I had stayed before and they were full. I ended up at the city homeless shelter, where I had been attacked before. That shelter is full of drugs and violence, in fact, the police were called that night for a fight involving 5 men, one of which ended up in the hospital in critical condition. After a sleepless night on a hard cot, I spent the day at social services trying to find a place to stay. I was still in my pajamas and slippers from the morning I left. Thankfully the shelter placed me in a hotel room. I have been moved from hotel to hotel since then and have slowly been trying to get my life back. It’s difficult but at least I am away from him and safe.

So today I got so upset that I called the police to see how they could help me.
My (30F) partner (30M) has been yelling at my kids and I in a really threatening and scary manner to the point that I never feel 100% safe at home... and I never want to leave the kids alone with him...

Well today the police told me it sounds like I need a restraining order put in place and they will come and get him on Friday to serve him and to tell him to get out, that he can’t live here anymore etc...

I feel terrible... I love this man but he can’t treat me and my kids this way... but I am scared that the restraining order might be a bit of overkill but I just can’t think of any other way they could help me keep him away and out of my house etc...

I feel so guilty and like I am making a mountain out of a molehill because it’s not like he is hitting us etc..
I just don’t think I could break up with him safely without this?

I have been doing better but he decided to text me from a fake app number because he thought I blocked his number but I haven't yet in case he decides to try contact me like he did again and I need to get a restraining order if he gets threating again.  I had to move in with other people because I don't want him knowing where I live and had to leave a job because I had severe attacks daily that were triggered thinking he might show up because he knew where I worked. I feel like maybe I don't get to be so fucked up from him because people have been through worse and deal better than I do. I just don't want to think anymore that everyone in my life is a threat. I know my childhood made me go on to pick a piece of shit like him as a partner because my needs were far from met and yay me I found a guy who will help with everything. Turns out he did that for awhile and that's because I did whatever he asked but then he stopped helping me altogether and just turned very abusive. I don't want to feel sorry for myself anymore. I don't want pity.

We have since moved on to a city pretty far away, and are finally feeling safe 3 years later.  I personally check up on her abuser (carefully and only through social media) to make sure he isnt up to any schemes that could put us in danger.

I recently discovered he is engaged again. He gets engaged very fast after dating, and its through all sorts of coercion and manipulation that he got my girfriend to submit to his request that got her trapped. They have a wedding website set up for a wedding that will take place in 2021. Every bit of evidence screams she is about to experience the same dangerous situation. Though he did show signs of being an abuser early on, the guy flipped a serious switch after the marriage.

On one hand, I feel relieved that my girlfriend may be ultimately safe from a very unstable man who would obsess over her if he were not moving on.  But I just cant help feeling like I am the only one who knows what will happen to this poor woman (My girflriend doesnt know of the engagement) .  


I have 2 tough questions:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Do I tell my girlfriend that he has recently gotten engaged, in hopes that she will feel safer and her anxiety and trauma decrease? Or is it just better to not bring this up and pretend like I know nothing?  


2) Is there anything I can do or should do to help the woman recently engaged to him, who will no doubt have her life ruined, if not completely eliminated by this violent and manipulative man?  Or do I need to move on myself, let it be, in order to not endanger my own girlfriend?

I consider my dad to be an emotionally abusive man, but it was not his fault. I forgave him long ago and have a lot of empathy now. When I was a junior in high school I had 0 self esteem and severe anxiety because of my dad. It was then that I met my ex fiancee (let's call him Chad).

Chad was charming at first. We were happy. I was head over heels for him until we went to college. Then he started to withdraw. He wouldn't visit me (I went to a school about 2 hours from him). He was emotionally unavailable. I was a freshman. I had no self esteem. I was lost. I transferred to be with him (it was a much better school and I have no regrets for other reasons). The relationship took an even more toxic turn. He would pressure me to have sex with other women (I am bisexual but am not so into the multiple partners at the same time thing). He would pressure me into threesomes. He was a habitual cheater. He was constantly encouraging me to fuck other people I didn't want to fuck so he could feel better about doing it behind my back. All the while he reminded me constantly how worthless I was, and how lucky I was he loved me because no one else ever would. There was at least one night when he pressured me I to sex I absolutely did not want, and I cried a lot after.

Then we got engaged and moved. He graduated college late and wanted to go to law school. He moved to be with me and contributed 0 to the household. I had 3 jobs for a while to keep us afloat while he played go on the internet. He refused to take me on dates. He was terrible with money and wouldn't let me spend anything myself, but would buy gadgets often. He refused to get a job. But still I was lucky to have him. 

He started to pressure me to have sex with my girlfriends, either alone or in front of him. He would find other women and pressure me into sleeping with them. I contracted an STD from one of these encounters. He went on dates with other women and told me about them. He tried to fuck my friends. He had a mistress who was a friend's ex (this happened a lot) who he fucked for years. He didn't try to hide it. He often told me how much better she was than me. He started law school, did terribly at it, and reminded me constantly that I was the reason he was failing.

He wanted me to be something sexually that I wasn't. He would dress me up in BDSM lingerie and clothes. He would complain I wasn't sexy enough or didn't meet his needs. He told me what to wear. He constantly demeaned my looks or clothing choices. By the end he was telling me to wear sexual clothes that made me uncomfortable.

I should have left, but he told me that I promised to love him unconditionally. I though no one would want me. That I was disgusting. I stayed for 10 years. I believed I was worthless. I only got out because I developed a crush that let me see things more clearly (he did not like me back). 

Now I'm married to a great guy but I feel cut off from him and totally numb. We made some unrelated mistakes. He was selfish early on and steamrolled me. I didn't have a voice. He NEVER would do anything to hurt me. But I feel so numb.

Can anyone help me describe what my ex was and did? He never hit me, so I never understood what was happening as abuse.  Everything I try to use to talk about it feels wrong.

First thank you for this subreddit and for taking the time to read this; I'll try to keep it short as possible. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was with my partner (we were engaged) for 4 /12 years.  It was a match made in heaven in my eyes and in some twisted way I still see it that way.  We both work in the same industry as freelancers, have many of the same likes and way of living.  The big difference was his drinking was a huge problem.  Everytime he would get drunk he would either hit me or verbally drag me through the mud and call me a spic, good for nothing artist that wouldn't be anyone in this world without him.  He would insult my family and friends and say he was the only one who understood me.  He would never remember the fights or his actions.  His apologizes half ass because he did constantly.  2 years into the relationship our sex life was basically once every six months, I proposed an open relationship because I figured he might want to be with other men, I was fine with it because it's just sex not love.  But what bothered me is that he never wanted to have sex with me, I always begged and was shut down.  Even acts of affection like kissing he would reject me.  All while he drank and would get mean.  He would get jealous if I hung out with friends. Kept tabs on me.  August of 2019 we had a vacation and it was great until the end when he got drunk at his family wedding and hit me in the face with flowers leaving scratches on my face.  When we got back to NYC where we live every month he would be more cruel in his drinking and I would do everything in my power to strengthen the relationship by doing evening walks, figure drawing classes of each other during dinner, biking, upstate hikes for the day and etc.   He would fight me on all of them and say he never had time or was too busy.  I understood his career was taking off and mine was too so we threw ourselves into our work but I knew what was at stake.  

&amp;#x200B;

In January of 2020 I began running and working out to shed some weight so he can find me attractive.  But in those workouts which I haven't done in awhile because he didn't like when I worked out because he didn't know where I was, I began to reclaim my old self before I met him and realized what an abusive asshole he is to me.   He perfectly can tear me down and build me up and I allowed it because I was and still am in love with him.  Because I see him as a human who deserves respect he sees me as a stuffed animal he can do what he pleases with and have no consequences to his actions. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the beginning of Feb he came back from a work trip and lost his mind when he got home because I didn't wash the dishes (there were 3 plates and 2 cups) and I didn't make the bed properly.  He started throwing things around the house and this was the first time I ever saw him lose his cool sober and I got so scared I left the apartment and so did he.  I came back and he wasn't home and I packed my things so quickly and left to stay at a hotel for 7 days near the apartment.  I told him I needed space to understand why he thinks it's okay to treat me like this.  He said me leaving was a break up and told me some of the worst things I have ever heard in my life.  I cried and just wanted to run into his arms nonetheless.

&amp;#x200B;

I went to therapy and was told abusive relationships are difficult to get out of and not to be hard on myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then covid happen.  5 months apart, me in long island and he spent it in virginia.

Within those 5 months we spoke and talked about the relationship and how he is sorry for everything he ever did and regrets not doing the simple things with me to enjoy life.   I was so excited and hopeful he was showing signs of accountability and wanting to do the work.   I knew he was seeing guys over there because his libido came back and I was fine with it.  He came back last week and told me he was coming for work and to work on our relationship.  Only for me to find out he was spending the time in the apartment we built and I made home with the guy from virginia.   I know we aren't together but I just wish he didn't fuck with my head like this! I wish he didn't disrespect me and give me hope.  If he found someone else he should have told me.  Not left me with the impression he wanted to salvage things and bring his lover.  

He is doing things with him that i asked, walks at the end of the day, drawing each other during dinner, and being kind to him, not drinking as much.  

&amp;#x200B;

When i called him out on it he said that the guy is nothing to him but he succeed in making me jealous.  That the guy is an experiment on how to love me properly.  I knew he was lying because we met face to face yesterday and he told me he was torn because he loves him.

&amp;#x200B;

I made the choice yesterday after he left, after I fought with him because I asked him to stay longer with me and he said he had plans with the guy.  I made the choice for him that he couldn't.  I left officially and blocked him.  

&amp;#x200B;

I gave him almost 5 years of my life for him to throw it away in 7 days because he couldn't wait to see me and wanted to flaunt in my face that someone else wanted him..... I feel crazy because I know he is sick in the head, but I love him and wish it was us not them together.  

&amp;#x200B;

This will be a long journey of recovery.  Im scared and lonely but I can live with myself knowing I showed my love through actions and words to show someone I really loved them.

I’ve been out 9 months. The last 3 have been extremely hard and I am curious to know others experiences with psyc meds after abuse. 

I’ve never taken antidepressants. I do have some troubling substances abuse issues (alcohol, Xanax, ketamine), albeit mostly under control, it has affected my ability to function in the past and very recently.

I’ve been with a great therapist for over a year, and while she was instrumental in getting me out of physical harms way, I’m still struggling very much with the trauma, missing him terribly, still very stuck under his control, unable to move on with my love life, obsessing over what he thinks or says of me. He threatened me into having an abortion I didn’t want and raped me very early on in the relationship.. these were the 2 major injuries to me that still hurt me daily.

It’s been no contact for 9 months, I have no clue of anyway to reach him or where he is living now.

On the surface I know that I am doing alright considering, my people are proud of me, but inside it is a different story. 

Sorry for the length, just want to be understood. Please share how meds have and have not helped you through your stories.

I'm not sure how to approach and navigate the current situation that is happening with my sister and her fiance. Please share what you would do in this situation. I'm seeking legal advice and emotional advice. Even personal advice/experiences. A different perspective maybe. I'm just trying to figure out how to navigate this situation.  I want to be there for my sister but I want to do what's right as well.   


Situation:   


My mom basically gave my sister a guilt trip today because she never goes to visit them. My sister didn't visit them at all during the holidays last year. No visit for either of their birthdays or Mother's Day. Even though they live only 20 minutes away. My parent's never see her.  So in retaliation to that - my sister contacted my mother today and sent her a picture and told her that the dresser fell on her and that's why she wasn't coming to visit for Father's Day. The picture she sent was of her face. In the picture she has a huge busted up lip, swollen nose and looks like she will have two black eyes soon. After some interrogation from my mothers end (because my mom didn't just fall off a turnip truck- she knew that wasn't from a dresser) - my sister admitted that it was her fiance that did it. They have been living together for several years. Maybe 8 years or so.   


Her (my sister) current stance on the situation is that she is fine. She does not want to leave him.  She does not want the police involved. He is ""not that kind of man"". He feels bad. He's been saying he needs counseling like he's had in the past. His temper just got away from him. Sometimes he sees red. He asked her to call the cops on him after it happened. He wanted her to go to my moms house for the night after it happened.  (These are all the excuses and things she has told me and/or my mother today.) She also said that there was not alcohol involved. It is hard to know what to believe from her though. She also let it slip to me that this ""hasn't happened in a long time"". So even though she told both of us it was the first time this has happened - that was a lie. 

&amp;#x200B;

Full Picture/Background info:   


Some background information about my sister. She is a recovering alcoholic, maybe active (not sure). 34 years old. She has no children. She was married for about 18 months in her early 20s then divorced. She started drinking in her early 20's and went downhill from there. She's always had social anxiety. ""Chip on her shoulder"" persona throughout her entire lifetime. She has a few DUI's from her really bad days of alcoholism. She's been in in-patient rehab facilities. She's told me that she's also a sex addict. She is also bulimic. She's told us she's been raped before. She used to go out a lot to bars and I think there is a lot of things that have happened to her that we don't even know about. A lot of legal things with her life she won't tell us. She bottles things up a lot. I'm not sure if there are any other drugs involved in her life or her fiances life. I know they smoke cannabis sometimes. And I think she is still drinking. She was talking with an online therapist on talkspace off and on within the last few years but she doesn't do that anymore. Her and my mom butt heads a lot because my mom tells her how it is all the time. Last time things were bad with my sister - it stressed my mom out so much that my mother swallowed a whole bottle of pills and was rushed to the hospital to have her stomach pumped. So my mom can't handle this new situation that has now arose. My mom's psychiatrist (from the last drama time) told her she had to distance herself from her daughter, (my sister). And that is now what my mom will try to do again. She won't be able to handle seeing Robyn stay together with an abusive partner. My dad is kind of like me. He's upset about it but doesn't know what to do.   


The ""fiance"" (man that beat up my sister Friday night) has a ""car salesman"" type of personality. He always drives her around when she needs to go somewhere. He's always the one talking when they are together. Robyn is never around my parents or myself without him there. It's almost like she's using him as a crutch. At least this is what I thought of their relationship in the early days. He isn't someone I ever imagined my sister being with. But my sister has changed so much since we were kids. SHe's not the same person anymore. She hasn't been the same since she started heavily drinking in her early 20's. They live in the middle of nowhere Oklahoma. I don't know a whole lot about him. He is the type that will lie and spin the truth. He grew up in a different small town in Oklahoma. He is around 33 years old and has 2 daughters of his own. Both of them with a different woman other than my sister. My sister actually works with his mom at a laundry mat. And even though they are only 20 minute drive from my parents. My sister never goes to visit my parents. (I personally live in Florida. I've been living here since February. Before that, I lived in Germany for 5 years preceding. So I've been physically very far away from all of this.) I flew to Oklahoma just last week to visit them all. I hadn't seen my parents and my sister in almost 2 years. I just moved back to the states from Germany. Now I'm able to visit my parents and sister much easier and quicker. I swear last week when I hugged my sister for the first time in almost 2 years, that I could smell alcohol. If you know someone that is an alcoholic - you know that smell that the skin and pores releases. 

&amp;#x200B;

What to do now?   


So when we first got the real truth about what happened. Of course my mom and dad were ready to get a gun and go after him. Then the next thought was -  to call the police.   
But then we have my sister asking us not to tell anyone, asking us not post anything, asking us not to call the police or to call her fiance. (Which she called her boyfriend today-- which I noticed that she didn't refer to him as her fiance like usual.) We have evidence on our phone of what her face looks like. And her admission to what happened. She was careful not to give too many details about what happened too. She said she didn't want us reporting him so she didn't want to tell us. I did get from her that it happened Friday night and that it was him that did that to her face. And that it was because of stress from money and he ""exploded"".  I tried to convince her to leave him. To move in with me. But, she didn't want any of that. My mom told her she was buying her a ticket to fly her to Florida to stay with me. She didn't want that. Didn't want to talk about it.  She's been saying she's fine. And it's not a big deal. She's asked me not to think about it. She's been saying contradicting things to me all day. For example she said he ""barely drinks"". Then she states later that he doesn't drink at all. Then also she stated that she had a safe place figured out for that night he beat her that she could have gone to if she needed to. But then later she says that she feels completely safe with him. If you have to even think of a safe place - you do not feel safe.   


So my question is -- what do I do in this situation? 

Does anyone know of an organization that I can connect my sister with so she can get some professional advice? I think she would be open speaking with a therapist, maybe.

The person in question isn't my ex rather than my sisters and the father of my nieces. Over the 11 years he's caused my family a  ton of trauma. 

*This is a long one. 
Back in 2012-2014 my sister would have horrible anxiety and panic attacks to the point she would have to go to the hospital. During that time he would slowly become an alcoholic and cheat on her with minors.
He was 21 and the girls were between 15-17, he was wasted when he told her. He also raped my sister which caused her to become pregnant. (It was nonconsensual she had no choice but to have sex with him because he was wasted and she didn't want him to snap) 
He also once walked in on me while I was in the shower when I was 13ish but everyone seemed to forget.

During those years I was in and out of the hospital with her, keep in mind I was absolutely depressed and suicidal. 
I once had to fight him off because he trying to take my niece while he was drunk. 

In 2017 they had a big fight (We all live together to save money)
he was also hooked on cocaine. He was trying to take my youngest niece which was 3 at the time. As I was running down the stairs carrying her while he was chasing me to get to the other room to call the cops. I slipped on the last few step, the baby was safe since I was fast enough to prop her standing up. Me on the other hand wasnt I had a sprained ankle. 
He accused me of throwing MY NIECE to get back at him when HE was chasing me.

In 2018, he was so out of it. Me and my mother had left to mexico to visit my grandmother since she was dying. My dad couldn't go since he had a stroke shortly after the 2017 incident. My sister kicked him out and he would sit outside for about an hour being absolute lunatic.

2019 was the final straw.
My sister went out after work and he completely lost his shit. Banging on my door asking for her. I had no idea where she was because she didn't tell she was going out.
The next few months were one of the most traumitizing moments of my life. I believe I got ptsd. 

He retaliated by crashing their car, threatening to kill her and take the girls from her. 
Then he got a restraining order placed for a year (Sister, nieces, me etc), can't be near our house or anyone within 100yrds. He gets to see his kids every sunday but my sister usually trails along because she loves him. 
A whole bunch of stuff happened from october - december he supposedly got clean so no coke or alcohol. 

Now 2020: 
He moved to an area nearby and got kicked out twice, then he moved again to napa (If you have can find any articles for an armed robbery in the contra costa or napa area please send it me! I believe it was 4 people) He and his friends robbed somewhere and they split the cash unevenly and he got jumped by them. 

Now in may he moved literally 4 blocks away and he has a gun illegally. My sister talks to him everyday, he drinks again and he's verbally abusive towards my nieces. The older one told me he constantly yells at them for no reason. My niece told me that she fears for her and her sisters life and she doesn't want her life to go back to what it once was. She said that their mom just sits their pretending as if nothing is wrong. My sister doesn't want to give me a copy of the restraining order.
She's in denial that it's abuse, if you have any articles that I can send to her to prove her wrong. PLEASE send them to me. 

If anyone has any information on what I can do (I'm in california), to help my nieces let me know. I'm currently 21 and unemployed, I don't know if there's much I can do.

I spent 3 months at his house and it was great in the beginning. He was so nice, always complimenting me, spending time with me, doing things for me, etc. towards the end though, things got bad again. He started using drugs, being emotionally and physically abusive, and forcing me to do everything around the house. Any money I had would be taken away from me to support his drug habit. He stopped being interested in me and wouldn’t spend any time with me. I felt so alone and the fact that I couldn’t go anywhere made things so much worse. It finally came to a head when he woke me up one morning demanding money. Somehow he had figured out that a friend from Guam had sent me $50 to renew my I.D. He must have unlocked my phone while I was sleeping with my fingerprint and gone through my messages. I could tell that he was sick from not having his drugs and I refused to go get the money for him. He proceeded to beat me all over and pull me out of the bed by my hair. I screamed for help and after kicking me in my abdomen a few times he left me alone. I managed to pull myself up and lock the bedroom door before he came back and hurt me some more. I was genuinely afraid that he was going to kill me (I’m very petite and he is very big, 6ft.10 and 300 lbs.) I was laying on the bed trying to recover from the beating when I heard a knock on the door and a voice saying “Police! Open up!” He had actually called the cops on me! When I opened the door I was grateful to see an officer who had helped me in the past and knew that my ex had a history of abuse and a problem with drugs. As I was leaving with the officer I passed out. He had to call an ambulance and I was taken to the hospital where I was admitted and kept for observation for that day and night. During the attack, he had given me a concussion, a black eye, and caused bruising to my kidneys. 

Once the doctor determined that I was ok to be released, they realized that I had nowhere to go. They contacted the local domestic violence shelter where I had stayed before and they were full. I ended up at the city homeless shelter, where I had been attacked before. That shelter is full of drugs and violence, in fact, the police were called that night for a fight involving 5 men, one of which ended up in the hospital in critical condition. After a sleepless night on a hard cot, I spent the day at social services trying to find a place to stay. I was still in my pajamas and slippers from the morning I left. Thankfully the shelter placed me in a hotel room. I have been moved from hotel to hotel since then and have slowly been trying to get my life back. It’s difficult but at least I am away from him and safe.

So today I got so upset that I called the police to see how they could help me.
My (30F) partner (30M) has been yelling at my kids and I in a really threatening and scary manner to the point that I never feel 100% safe at home... and I never want to leave the kids alone with him...

Well today the police told me it sounds like I need a restraining order put in place and they will come and get him on Friday to serve him and to tell him to get out, that he can’t live here anymore etc...

I feel terrible... I love this man but he can’t treat me and my kids this way... but I am scared that the restraining order might be a bit of overkill but I just can’t think of any other way they could help me keep him away and out of my house etc...

I feel so guilty and like I am making a mountain out of a molehill because it’s not like he is hitting us etc..
I just don’t think I could break up with him safely without this?

We have since moved on to a city pretty far away, and are finally feeling safe 3 years later.  I personally check up on her abuser (carefully and only through social media) to make sure he isnt up to any schemes that could put us in danger.

I recently discovered he is engaged again. He gets engaged very fast after dating, and its through all sorts of coercion and manipulation that he got my girfriend to submit to his request that got her trapped. They have a wedding website set up for a wedding that will take place in 2021. Every bit of evidence screams she is about to experience the same dangerous situation. Though he did show signs of being an abuser early on, the guy flipped a serious switch after the marriage.

On one hand, I feel relieved that my girlfriend may be ultimately safe from a very unstable man who would obsess over her if he were not moving on.  But I just cant help feeling like I am the only one who knows what will happen to this poor woman (My girflriend doesnt know of the engagement) .  


I have 2 tough questions:

&amp;#x200B;

2) Is there anything I can do or should do to help the woman recently engaged to him, who will no doubt have her life ruined, if not completely eliminated by this violent and manipulative man?  Or do I need to move on myself, let it be, in order to not endanger my own girlfriend?

My husband tends to snap at me a lot.

For several months he was working on it and it stopped being a problem, but since the pandemic started he's started to do it again more often on a day to day basis. 


The last time it happened was last week. We were eating and he had to suddenly run into work and all I did was remind him of something related to his job he had told me about earlier. This led to him snapping at me that he already knew, etc. When he got home he apologized, but then got mad at me because I was still upset??? and said why can't he apologize and we just move on? It was hard for me to immediately move on because the snapping was happening every single day leading up to that incident. Like at that point it was the culmination of being snapped at day after day. He didn't get it at first but then he ended up apologizing again and explained he was stressed with work and took it out on me and was sorry. But then he added that I push him and he felt like I was ""challenging him"" when I said the work reminder, which is why he snapped at me. It feels like he started with an apology for his behavior but then put the blame on me? He said he would continue to work on it and since last week we haven't had any issues but idk. I wasn't trying to push him or challenge him and just wanted to remind him of something. I just dont get what I did that was so wrong? Any advice helps.

I have to spill my sin and I think it might qualify as some level of borderline abuse and could really use some advice. Its a graphic story of what just happened though so please don't read if your sensitive.   
My overall question though if you don't want to read id how long does it take you to feel better after ""minor"" strangulation?

&amp;#x200B;

I feel way to embarassed to go to my Dr about this and Im a hypochondriac so maybe Im thinking to much on it.

&amp;#x200B;

Im 29, really fat and partially blind so I don't get out much. I have a pretty face but not much else. I have no friends and my idea of a wet dream is when dream men hold my hand. My family has been belittling me about being almost 30 with no friends, boyfriend or life pretty much since my birthday. Though I just finally graduated college with my BA.🤷🏻‍♀️

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway an ex hit me up the other day. Like the last guy I ever dated eight years ago. He was a charming douche but I still kinda had fun with him and he was the first guy I had more than one consensual sexual encounter with at 22. Even though Iv never really liked it and he would always say ""your welcome"" after like ge did me the favor so I dumped him.

&amp;#x200B;

But yesterday I was desperate and dumb and here was some rare attention so I cleaned up my apartment, got as nice looking as I could and he came over saying he would only stay for like a half hour and talk and stuff cuz I told him I might not feel the best. But I really liked the feeling of being hugged and cuddled. Its not something   
I ever get to feel and he knows how pathetic I am so I know he used that to charm me. And so my dumb brain turned off and I gave in to his advances. I thought this time I would be assertive and a strong women and try not to care about my fat body while he had a nice one. Plus I had ovarian surgery last year and haven't been able to reach orgasm since (though never had issues before blah) and thought I would try once with a person instead of myself to see if it could fix me.   
It was ok at first. Though he is kinda on the small penis end he is a huge guy. Back in the day he always begged me for blow jobs and I never gave in because I told him it reminded me of bad stuff I went through as a kid and grosses me out. But 29 year old me has been through therapy and wanted to be confident so I did it and that's when I noticed he wasn't simply douchy like long ago he started saying a lot of degrading things to me and forcing my arms and head to do things even when I tried to pull away. Then when he tried normal way out of nowhere he started strangling me. Im 5ft2 and he is 6ft3 with large hands and it shocked me a lot. I started struggling and he just squeezed harder. I never passed out and could kinda breath tiny kinda trying to kick him off. but my veins felt really restricted. He's really strong so I could not move his hands. But he let up and I was too shocked to say anything but then he kept randomly doing it off and on. I am not sure if I froze and thats why I didnt have the courage to end it there. But I am a people pleaser I guess and he had driven far so I felt bad and didn't want to disappoint him or irritate him. At that point I just was screaming in my head for it to end and starting thinking of scape options like how to make him happy so it will stop in my head but I still pretended to enjoy it a little and pretended everything was fine and pretended to be the confident woman like I had read about trying to be. And then he put a pillow over my head and was preasing down on my mouth area. When I freed my mouth gasping for air he fought me to keep it on and kept trying to stop me breathing and it took me a couple minutes to get it away. Or felt that way. Then he acted like he was all nice and tried touching me and holding me down so I pretended to like it so it would be over faster. But it wasn't and he forced my head to do other things that were a lot more painful and degrading than the how to articals described. I did managed a loud awkward no with one disgusting unforgivable reqest and keep my head away despite the yanking till he moved on. So I was kinda panicking now inside but still trying to make him happy so he would finish and leave. Heck I even smiled and laughed awkwardly trying to talk about things when I got the chance to breath freely but he kept telling me to shut up. Though I know he knew he was hurting me at times because when I couldn't hold the fake enjoyment it made him happier and he strangled me a few more times randomly even though I was clawing and kicking at him. By the end I just did what he wanted plastered a fake smile on my face because if he would just be done it would stop. At least that was my thinking. When it was over, after he said he would just finish ""on me"" but then forced it in my mouth to do it there, nasty grossest crap, and made a few more rude remarks it was over. Throughout it he also pretended the condom fell off and kept going though I told him there was another and seemed to mumble something about being pregnant already idk. Hopefully my dud ovary and blocked tube does its job. He also slapped my body several times throughout. He was all pleased with himself and I just kinda obvious fake laughed it off awkwardly kinda but thinking back I was in a scared disgusted daze at the same time. And then he just left trying to be charming and give me a hug and mumbled something about next time and I got kinda mad finally and said ""next time? il be hurting you"" he laughed and I pushed him out the door. I also said ""Your Welcome"" as I shut it just as a throwback. So my self confidence apparently only kickes in when I don't have a giant sergeant holding me down of course ugh.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like a damn fool for even thinking of trusting anyone to touch me. And I feel like an even bigger fool for being so nice as to not be able to stick up for myself when I wanted to escape. I have a hard time believing he thought 100% I was actually enjoying myself by the way he would look and treat me. But he is such a strong tall military guy and I'm short fat and weak so I could not actually stop him from doing these things. But if I said no go away he probably would have if not sulking like when we were young. But than if he could act this differently than before maybe not? I knew he would be a douche but I felt kinda helpess and hurt though I could have stoped it idk. Should have. I was like a man handled ragdoll. And he knew for a fact I was not into bdsm type stuff cuz right before we were talking about movies scrolling by on netflix and he mentioned the 50 Shades movie and I said it was dumb and would never do that stuff..

But its not like he assaulted me though cuz I consented. I didn't consent to the bad stuff but I couldn't say no either though and I tried and did start kicking and making like ""stop noises"". Which he ignored and made it worse.

&amp;#x200B;

Lost story short my throat and neck hurt and I feel like a disgusting piece if slutty meat now when yesterday I felt like a happy content nun watching my cartoons with my cat.   


I feel violated and hurt. But I smiled and let him continue so it could be over faster. Plus I didn't wana make him mad or sonething. Not that I was afraid he'd hit me just I hate disappointing people. But maybe I should have been afraid and I am really disapointed in myself.

&amp;#x200B;

Today my neck feels tight kind of. I thought my anxiety was just making it feel that way. And sore throat is a given. But I just did a short workout and I can feel the blood pulse and rush through my neck and its really unerving and I hate it and now my neck feels like its still being strangled a little but I have no bruise. Can breathe fine despite soreness in my throat. But the internet said people can drop dead days after even a little bit of that. Im scared. Id rather die than humiliate myself with going to the doctor and explaining it and since I cant drive Id have to explain to my master at belittling me sister to get there. But has anyone else felt this? Will it get better? Its just still fresh and maybe a little bruised inside? Google is giving me visions of my blood vessels snapping, strokes or esophagus being partially crushed without realizing it. Though   
I'm eating fine Id rather not randomly die in a few days. The sensation is just bothering me mentally bad.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice?

&amp;#x200B;

For the record Im just going to stick to dream men for the rest of my life. Im not someone who trusts easily and now I realize its not worth even involving myself with anyone. Even more so when Im broken sexually and cant feel stuff anyway. I literally just did it as an experiment and to make him happy so I could get some hugs from a human being. I feel so gross now like my body and mouth are contaminated and I should not touch anything, eat food, or kiss even my cats or family now like I will spread the nastiness of what I did to things I love.

I'll try not to make this longer than it needs to be. 
My best friend (20 f) is in an abusive relationship &amp; its getting worse, they've been together for three years &amp; it's all abuse expect for sexual (that I'm aware of). She already has a lot going on with uni &amp; trying to improve her mental health, I don't want her to stay in this relationship while it just gets worse &amp; worse &amp; by the time she leaves.. If she does... She has even more, harder, stuff to work on.
The problem is, I'm a teenager &amp; I also live in a different state to her. She's come to stay with me before when things were bad but that was only for a week so she could have a “break“.
As you can tell, I'm a bit helpless.
I've offered to her for her to come live with me &amp; my family permanently as my family has been thru domestic violence &amp; we have given people a place to stay many times. My offer wasn't long ago &amp; I told her i/we could help her move up her around January time so she could have time to change unis &amp; settle in, that stuff. She just seems really reluctant to really take on help or even help herself as harsh as that sounds because she is so used to living in a DV situation (she moved in with her bfs family almost two years ago to get away from her families abuse) &amp; she also has bpd which makes leaving very hard to put it simple, if you have bpd is you get what I mean. Plus she has no friends or family there that she can go with. She only has me &amp; some of my friends up here.

I've spoken to my mum about it &amp; she told me I need to be straightforward with my friend which I have been because as we all know this is so serious &amp; dangerous &amp; friends have to be honest with eachother regardless. She told me I need to tell my friend to search for resources &amp; shelerts &amp; for her not to tell anyone (of course) &amp; reassure her that people will help her because of the situation she's in. I've told her this all. I've even given her resources to look into but she just won't take it. She's scared too &amp; I asked her how isn't she more scared to stay in this situation? He's only bringing her down &amp; he will only get worse. He's a manipulater &amp; he's gaslighting you. I said stuff like that in a caring way.she comes to me for support mostly &amp; I know that I can't “save“ her, she needs to save herself but it's honestly scary &amp; I don't want her to end up dead which is worst case situation. 

What can I do to help my friend? I know she has to want to help herself but what are some resources I can at least recommend to her (shelters, support groups, therapy centres ect) that might help her make the first step?

I'm selling my house, the house I was abused in for over a year. I'm currently detaching from my partner and working on healing but occasionally he comes back (he moved back with his dad just 5 miles away), lets himself in, etc. I let it happen and try avoid conflict because I know that until the house is sold, because we're so close geographically, I'm not safe.

This man has no care for the law, does what he wants, thinks he's above the law and isn't bothered about facing the police, punishment, or even jail time. If I fully broke things off with him now he would definitely, 100%, destroy the house and make it unsellable (at least to the current buyer who has a mortgage) - or at the very least keep me here much longer and closer to him! He wants to control my life.

So I will sell, and run. I have a buyer so within a couple of months I should be outta here, woooo! That said, I'm a young entrepreneur and own my home outright. He did some renovation work when we moved in, maybe £2-4k worth. We were in a happy relationship at this time and never discussed payment. Legally, he's entitled to nothing.

That said, he expects 50% (around £50,000). I have a voice recording of him saying:

&gt;'whatever you get from here, half of that is going in my account, which is payment for building this fucking shithole, that's taken up 3 years of my life with you, you miserable fucking piece of shit. if you don't, I will dedicate the rest of my fucking life to killing you, you fucking asshole'.

I will be moving back to nearer my hometown, about 40 miles away, but it's just a short train ride away. How can I get help and protect myself? I only have unclear images of physical abuse (I think because I'm so pale the camera doesn't pick up well, and he's never left bruises or serious marks/cuts), the only thing I have as hard 'evidence' is the recording - so even if I tried to press charges the highest charge he'd get is common assault? Even then, for a common assault offence to have taken place, the threat must be immediate, so the charge would fail.

To give you an idea of my partner, he had already been in prison twice for domestic violence previously and has spent approx 14 years in prison for a myriad of offences in total. 
 My first boyfriend, 21 years my senior and the first man who spontaneously opened up the capacity for romantic love for the opposite sex after a life time of sexual violence, has just been arrested for domestic violence; finally. 

He was the person who taught me what it meant to ‘light up a room’ through free expression of his effervescent charisma, whilst also being the person who made me walk on egg shells for fear he would permanently scar or kill me. 

He’s threatened to throw acid in my face, kill me in a multitude of ways (such as ‘stab/slice me up and leave me begging for mercy’), kick my head in on multiple occasions, arrange for people in my town 20 years older and in his 40-odd year old age bracket to beat me up. He’s called up the organisation who manages where I live and tried to intentionally make me homeless by telling them discriminatory and incriminating information about me. I’ve trusted him with information that I have never told anyone, running along the theme of childhood sexual abuse, just for him to turn around and use that information as golden ammunition to assassinate, blackmail me with, and threaten to post all over Facebook. 

He’s hyper possessive, jealous, and up until now only been emotionally and mentally abusive. He has had me genuinely believe I wasn’t worth shit and that I really was a fat, useless whore who no one else would want which were words repeatedly uttered from his lips. That ‘my pussy wasn’t worth shit’, and that I really was ‘shit in bed’ amongst other things. 

He was like Jekyll and Hyde, night and day. It was very confusing having my best friend and lover to be so nasty and full of cruel hate.  

Well I really tried to avoid getting the police involved and even called up his probation officer as a professional alternative after he threatened to throw acid in my face and tried to make me homeless - hoping he perhaps could speak some sense into him. 
Well today it finally happened, the next step on his linear progression of abuse: after yet again accusing me of sleeping with a vast array of people, (which has never been true), he got up, walked over to the bed which I was sitting and planted three punches to my face and jaw. I started screaming, so he picked up a pillow and started telling me to shut the fuck up - I watched his face calculate his thought process as he proceeded to pick up a large glass bottle. 
‘Is this guy going to finally kill me by smothering me with this pillow he’s grasping? Or is he going to hit me with this bottle instead?’ I thought - I honestly didn’t care, I just carried on screaming as to set off an alarm for the neighbour next door. 

She let me call the police on her phone after he had decorated my face and stole my phone before running from the building. The police came and they asked me a million questions - not just about the current event, but our general dynamic and concluded that they wanted to prosecute him also with coercive control. 
As I was doing my statement, he turned up back at the house with a face like a slapped arse and an apology. He looked poignant and remorseful as the police snapped him in handcuffs, “you’re not going to press charges are you babe?” he asked.
Truth is that I don’t know, but I’m gutted that I’ve lost my best friend and partner. 
He’s on license as he came out of prison in July last year, so chances are he’ll be recalled and’ll be going back there for a few months to complete his sentence behind bars.

He would pressure me into threesomes. He was a habitual cheater. He was constantly encouraging me to fuck other people I didn't want to fuck so he could feel better about doing it behind my back. All the while he reminded me constantly how worthless I was, and how lucky I was he loved me because no one else ever would. There was at least one night when he pressured me I to sex I absolutely did not want, and I cried a lot after.

Then we got engaged and moved. He graduated college late and wanted to go to law school. He moved to be with me and contributed 0 to the household. I had 3 jobs for a while to keep us afloat while he played go on the internet. He refused to take me on dates. He was terrible with money and wouldn't let me spend anything myself, but would buy gadgets often. He refused to get a job. But still I was lucky to have him. 

He started to pressure me to have sex with my girlfriends, either alone or in front of him. He would find other women and pressure me into sleeping with them. I contracted an STD from one of these encounters. He went on dates with other women and told me about them. He tried to fuck my friends. He had a mistress who was a friend's ex (this happened a lot) who he fucked for years. He didn't try to hide it. He often told me how much better she was than me. He started law school, did terribly at it, and reminded me constantly that I was the reason he was failing.

He wanted me to be something sexually that I wasn't. He would dress me up in BDSM lingerie and clothes. He would complain I wasn't sexy enough or didn't meet his needs. He told me what to wear. He constantly demeaned my looks or clothing choices. By the end he was telling me to wear sexual clothes that made me uncomfortable.

I should have left, but he told me that I promised to love him unconditionally. I though no one would want me. That I was disgusting. I stayed for 10 years. I believed I was worthless. I only got out because I developed a crush that let me see things more clearly (he did not like me back). 

Now I'm married to a great guy but I feel cut off from him and totally numb. We made some unrelated mistakes. He was selfish early on and steamrolled me. I didn't have a voice. He NEVER would do anything to hurt me. But I feel so numb.

Can anyone help me describe what my ex was and did? He never hit me, so I never understood what was happening as abuse.  Everything I try to use to talk about it feels wrong. I feel like if I name it I can start dealing with it. Also any resources for healing would be greatly appreciated.",domesticviolence,Trouble understanding the language to use to describe abuse.,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/hcuhdr/trouble_understanding_the_language_to_use_to/,True

She is codependent and suffering. We stopped talking after her first son was born because she started being rude and I decided I didn't need that in my life but started talking a year ago. Something told my gut to get ahold of her and sure enough my gut was right. I don't need to tell everything but I can say that he has tied to kill her and he was arrested and bailed out the next day by his parents. She didn't get the proper help she needed by the victims advocate and lied about that happened even though she had hand marks around her neck. He has said he was going to kill her and her 2 kids several times. So one time she I didn't hear from her for a month and I begged her to just tell me she was ok that's all I needed to know. She agreed and said sorry. So I fucked up I got upset another month went by I left her text messages voice mail and nothing back. I got upset because I been working so hard to help her and get her help I fucked up and sent her some messages I regret nothing mean just how my feelings are hurt and I love her and always are there for her and all I asked for her is to tell me she was alright. She was getting on Instagram and sharing videos so why couldn't she just send a small response. Before we talked almost 5 times a week. Now she is not responding I haven't heard anything. I have called left voicemail again I have begged her to talk to me. I have been working with a victims advocate to get help to help her. She hasn't posted anything no activity in 2 weeks. What should I do stop trying to get ahold of her let it go. Call for a wellness check. Contact her brother tell him what's going on. Btw she hasn't told anyone what's really going on she was a foster child and doesn't have parents or a supportive family just her brother she talks to. The husband family is in denial and blames both of them for the so called drama and doesn't realize she is in deep danger. I had been working with a detective about 6 months ago to get enough evidence to charge him with attempted murder and we had everything but her statement that's all he needed. but he does tell her all the time how he's going to kill her and the kids drive off a cliff drive into the barrier he's going to kill himself he's already shot a gun in the house with the kids.

First thank you for this subreddit and for taking the time to read this; I'll try to keep it short as possible. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was with my partner (we were engaged) for 4 /12 years.  It was a match made in heaven in my eyes and in some twisted way I still see it that way.  We both work in the same industry as freelancers, have many of the same likes and way of living.  The big difference was his drinking was a huge problem.  Everytime he would get drunk he would either hit me or verbally drag me through the mud and call me a spic, good for nothing artist that wouldn't be anyone in this world without him.  He would insult my family and friends and say he was the only one who understood me.  He would never remember the fights or his actions.  His apologizes half ass because he did constantly.  2 years into the relationship our sex life was basically once every six months, I proposed an open relationship because I figured he might want to be with other men, I was fine with it because it's just sex not love.  But what bothered me is that he never wanted to have sex with me, I always begged and was shut down.  Even acts of affection like kissing he would reject me.  All while he drank and would get mean.  He would get jealous if I hung out with friends. Kept tabs on me.  August of 2019 we had a vacation and it was great until the end when he got drunk at his family wedding and hit me in the face with flowers leaving scratches on my face.  When we got back to NYC where we live every month he would be more cruel in his drinking and I would do everything in my power to strengthen the relationship by doing evening walks, figure drawing classes of each other during dinner, biking, upstate hikes for the day and etc.   He would fight me on all of them and say he never had time or was too busy.  I understood his career was taking off and mine was too so we threw ourselves into our work but I knew what was at stake.  

&amp;#x200B;

In January of 2020 I began running and working out to shed some weight so he can find me attractive.  But in those workouts which I haven't done in awhile because he didn't like when I worked out because he didn't know where I was, I began to reclaim my old self before I met him and realized what an abusive asshole he is to me.   He perfectly can tear me down and build me up and I allowed it because I was and still am in love with him.  Because I see him as a human who deserves respect he sees me as a stuffed animal he can do what he pleases with and have no consequences to his actions. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the beginning of Feb he came back from a work trip and lost his mind when he got home because I didn't wash the dishes (there were 3 plates and 2 cups) and I didn't make the bed properly.  He started throwing things around the house and this was the first time I ever saw him lose his cool sober and I got so scared I left the apartment and so did he.  I came back and he wasn't home and I packed my things so quickly and left to stay at a hotel for 7 days near the apartment.  I told him I needed space to understand why he thinks it's okay to treat me like this.  He said me leaving was a break up and told me some of the worst things I have ever heard in my life.  I cried and just wanted to run into his arms nonetheless.

&amp;#x200B;

I went to therapy and was told abusive relationships are difficult to get out of and not to be hard on myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then covid happen.  5 months apart, me in long island and he spent it in virginia.

Within those 5 months we spoke and talked about the relationship and how he is sorry for everything he ever did and regrets not doing the simple things with me to enjoy life.   I was so excited and hopeful he was showing signs of accountability and wanting to do the work.   I knew he was seeing guys over there because his libido came back and I was fine with it.  He came back last week and told me he was coming for work and to work on our relationship.  Only for me to find out he was spending the time in the apartment we built and I made home with the guy from virginia.   I know we aren't together but I just wish he didn't fuck with my head like this! I wish he didn't disrespect me and give me hope.  If he found someone else he should have told me.  Not left me with the impression he wanted to salvage things and bring his lover.  

He is doing things with him that i asked, walks at the end of the day, drawing each other during dinner, and being kind to him, not drinking as much.  

&amp;#x200B;

When i called him out on it he said that the guy is nothing to him but he succeed in making me jealous.  That the guy is an experiment on how to love me properly.  I knew he was lying because we met face to face yesterday and he told me he was torn because he loves him.

&amp;#x200B;

I made the choice yesterday after he left, after I fought with him because I asked him to stay longer with me and he said he had plans with the guy.  I made the choice for him that he couldn't.  I left officially and blocked him.  

&amp;#x200B;

I gave him almost 5 years of my life for him to throw it away in 7 days because he couldn't wait to see me and wanted to flaunt in my face that someone else wanted him..... I feel crazy because I know he is sick in the head, but I love him and wish it was us not them together.  

&amp;#x200B;

This will be a long journey of recovery.  Im scared and lonely but I can live with myself knowing I showed my love through actions and words to show someone I really loved them.

I’ve been out 9 months. The last 3 have been extremely hard and I am curious to know others experiences with psyc meds after abuse. 

I’ve never taken antidepressants. I do have some troubling substances abuse issues (alcohol, Xanax, ketamine), albeit mostly under control, it has affected my ability to function in the past and very recently.

I’ve been with a great therapist for over a year, and while she was instrumental in getting me out of physical harms way, I’m still struggling very much with the trauma, missing him terribly, still very stuck under his control, unable to move on with my love life, obsessing over what he thinks or says of me. He threatened me into having an abortion I didn’t want and raped me very early on in the relationship.. these were the 2 major injuries to me that still hurt me daily.

It’s been no contact for 9 months, I have no clue of anyway to reach him or where he is living now.

On the surface I know that I am doing alright considering, my people are proud of me, but inside it is a different story. 

Sorry for the length, just want to be understood. Please share how meds have and have not helped you through your stories.

I'm not sure how to approach and navigate the current situation that is happening with my sister and her fiance. Please share what you would do in this situation. I'm seeking legal advice and emotional advice. Even personal advice/experiences. A different perspective maybe. I'm just trying to figure out how to navigate this situation.  I want to be there for my sister but I want to do what's right as well.   


Situation:   


My mom basically gave my sister a guilt trip today because she never goes to visit them. My sister didn't visit them at all during the holidays last year. No visit for either of their birthdays or Mother's Day. Even though they live only 20 minutes away. My parent's never see her.  So in retaliation to that - my sister contacted my mother today and sent her a picture and told her that the dresser fell on her and that's why she wasn't coming to visit for Father's Day. The picture she sent was of her face. In the picture she has a huge busted up lip, swollen nose and looks like she will have two black eyes soon. After some interrogation from my mothers end (because my mom didn't just fall off a turnip truck- she knew that wasn't from a dresser) - my sister admitted that it was her fiance that did it. They have been living together for several years. Maybe 8 years or so.   


Her (my sister) current stance on the situation is that she is fine. She does not want to leave him.  She does not want the police involved. He is ""not that kind of man"". He feels bad. He's been saying he needs counseling like he's had in the past. His temper just got away from him. Sometimes he sees red. He asked her to call the cops on him after it happened. He wanted her to go to my moms house for the night after it happened.  (These are all the excuses and things she has told me and/or my mother today.) She also said that there was not alcohol involved. It is hard to know what to believe from her though. She also let it slip to me that this ""hasn't happened in a long time"". So even though she told both of us it was the first time this has happened - that was a lie. 

&amp;#x200B;

Full Picture/Background info:   


Some background information about my sister. She is a recovering alcoholic, maybe active (not sure). 34 years old. She has no children. She was married for about 18 months in her early 20s then divorced. She started drinking in her early 20's and went downhill from there. She's always had social anxiety. ""Chip on her shoulder"" persona throughout her entire lifetime. She has a few DUI's from her really bad days of alcoholism. She's been in in-patient rehab facilities. She's told me that she's also a sex addict. She is also bulimic. She's told us she's been raped before. She used to go out a lot to bars and I think there is a lot of things that have happened to her that we don't even know about. A lot of legal things with her life she won't tell us. She bottles things up a lot. I'm not sure if there are any other drugs involved in her life or her fiances life. I know they smoke cannabis sometimes. And I think she is still drinking. She was talking with an online therapist on talkspace off and on within the last few years but she doesn't do that anymore. Her and my mom butt heads a lot because my mom tells her how it is all the time. Last time things were bad with my sister - it stressed my mom out so much that my mother swallowed a whole bottle of pills and was rushed to the hospital to have her stomach pumped. So my mom can't handle this new situation that has now arose. My mom's psychiatrist (from the last drama time) told her she had to distance herself from her daughter, (my sister). And that is now what my mom will try to do again. She won't be able to handle seeing Robyn stay together with an abusive partner. My dad is kind of like me. He's upset about it but doesn't know what to do.   


The ""fiance"" (man that beat up my sister Friday night) has a ""car salesman"" type of personality. He always drives her around when she needs to go somewhere. He's always the one talking when they are together. Robyn is never around my parents or myself without him there. It's almost like she's using him as a crutch. At least this is what I thought of their relationship in the early days. He isn't someone I ever imagined my sister being with. But my sister has changed so much since we were kids. SHe's not the same person anymore. She hasn't been the same since she started heavily drinking in her early 20's. They live in the middle of nowhere Oklahoma. I don't know a whole lot about him. He is the type that will lie and spin the truth. He grew up in a different small town in Oklahoma. He is around 33 years old and has 2 daughters of his own. Both of them with a different woman other than my sister. My sister actually works with his mom at a laundry mat. And even though they are only 20 minute drive from my parents. My sister never goes to visit my parents. (I personally live in Florida. I've been living here since February. Before that, I lived in Germany for 5 years preceding. So I've been physically very far away from all of this.) I flew to Oklahoma just last week to visit them all. I hadn't seen my parents and my sister in almost 2 years. I just moved back to the states from Germany. Now I'm able to visit my parents and sister much easier and quicker. I swear last week when I hugged my sister for the first time in almost 2 years, that I could smell alcohol. If you know someone that is an alcoholic - you know that smell that the skin and pores releases. 

&amp;#x200B;

What to do now?   


So when we first got the real truth about what happened. Of course my mom and dad were ready to get a gun and go after him. Then the next thought was -  to call the police.   
But then we have my sister asking us not to tell anyone, asking us not post anything, asking us not to call the police or to call her fiance. (Which she called her boyfriend today-- which I noticed that she didn't refer to him as her fiance like usual.) We have evidence on our phone of what her face looks like. And her admission to what happened. She was careful not to give too many details about what happened too. She said she didn't want us reporting him so she didn't want to tell us. I did get from her that it happened Friday night and that it was him that did that to her face. And that it was because of stress from money and he ""exploded"".  I tried to convince her to leave him. To move in with me. But, she didn't want any of that. My mom told her she was buying her a ticket to fly her to Florida to stay with me. She didn't want that. Didn't want to talk about it.  She's been saying she's fine. And it's not a big deal. She's asked me not to think about it. She's been saying contradicting things to me all day. For example she said he ""barely drinks"". Then she states later that he doesn't drink at all. Then also she stated that she had a safe place figured out for that night he beat her that she could have gone to if she needed to. But then later she says that she feels completely safe with him. If you have to even think of a safe place - you do not feel safe.   


So my question is -- what do I do in this situation? 

Does anyone know of an organization that I can connect my sister with so she can get some professional advice? I think she would be open speaking with a therapist, maybe.

The person in question isn't my ex rather than my sisters and the father of my nieces. Over the 11 years he's caused my family a  ton of trauma. 

*This is a long one. 
Back in 2012-2014 my sister would have horrible anxiety and panic attacks to the point she would have to go to the hospital. During that time he would slowly become an alcoholic and cheat on her with minors.
He was 21 and the girls were between 15-17, he was wasted when he told her. He also raped my sister which caused her to become pregnant. (It was nonconsensual she had no choice but to have sex with him because he was wasted and she didn't want him to snap) 
He also once walked in on me while I was in the shower when I was 13ish but everyone seemed to forget.

During those years I was in and out of the hospital with her, keep in mind I was absolutely depressed and suicidal. 
I once had to fight him off because he trying to take my niece while he was drunk. 

In 2017 they had a big fight (We all live together to save money)
he was also hooked on cocaine. He was trying to take my youngest niece which was 3 at the time. As I was running down the stairs carrying her while he was chasing me to get to the other room to call the cops. I slipped on the last few step, the baby was safe since I was fast enough to prop her standing up. Me on the other hand wasnt I had a sprained ankle. 
He accused me of throwing MY NIECE to get back at him when HE was chasing me.

In 2018, he was so out of it. Me and my mother had left to mexico to visit my grandmother since she was dying. My dad couldn't go since he had a stroke shortly after the 2017 incident. My sister kicked him out and he would sit outside for about an hour being absolute lunatic.

2019 was the final straw.
My sister went out after work and he completely lost his shit. Banging on my door asking for her. I had no idea where she was because she didn't tell she was going out.
The next few months were one of the most traumitizing moments of my life. I believe I got ptsd. 

He retaliated by crashing their car, threatening to kill her and take the girls from her. 
Then he got a restraining order placed for a year (Sister, nieces, me etc), can't be near our house or anyone within 100yrds. He gets to see his kids every sunday but my sister usually trails along because she loves him. 
A whole bunch of stuff happened from october - december he supposedly got clean so no coke or alcohol. 

Now 2020: 
He moved to an area nearby and got kicked out twice, then he moved again to napa (If you have can find any articles for an armed robbery in the contra costa or napa area please send it me! I believe it was 4 people) He and his friends robbed somewhere and they split the cash unevenly and he got jumped by them. 

Now in may he moved literally 4 blocks away and he has a gun illegally. My sister talks to him everyday, he drinks again and he's verbally abusive towards my nieces. The older one told me he constantly yells at them for no reason. My niece told me that she fears for her and her sisters life and she doesn't want her life to go back to what it once was. She said that their mom just sits their pretending as if nothing is wrong. My sister doesn't want to give me a copy of the restraining order.
She's in denial that it's abuse, if you have any articles that I can send to her to prove her wrong. PLEASE send them to me. 

If anyone has any information on what I can do (I'm in california), to help my nieces let me know. I'm currently 21 and unemployed, I don't know if there's much I can do.

I spent 3 months at his house and it was great in the beginning. He was so nice, always complimenting me, spending time with me, doing things for me, etc. towards the end though, things got bad again. He started using drugs, being emotionally and physically abusive, and forcing me to do everything around the house. Any money I had would be taken away from me to support his drug habit. He stopped being interested in me and wouldn’t spend any time with me. I felt so alone and the fact that I couldn’t go anywhere made things so much worse. It finally came to a head when he woke me up one morning demanding money. Somehow he had figured out that a friend from Guam had sent me $50 to renew my I.D. He must have unlocked my phone while I was sleeping with my fingerprint and gone through my messages. I could tell that he was sick from not having his drugs and I refused to go get the money for him. He proceeded to beat me all over and pull me out of the bed by my hair. I screamed for help and after kicking me in my abdomen a few times he left me alone. I managed to pull myself up and lock the bedroom door before he came back and hurt me some more. I was genuinely afraid that he was going to kill me (I’m very petite and he is very big, 6ft.10 and 300 lbs.) I was laying on the bed trying to recover from the beating when I heard a knock on the door and a voice saying “Police! Open up!” He had actually called the cops on me! When I opened the door I was grateful to see an officer who had helped me in the past and knew that my ex had a history of abuse and a problem with drugs. As I was leaving with the officer I passed out. He had to call an ambulance and I was taken to the hospital where I was admitted and kept for observation for that day and night. During the attack, he had given me a concussion, a black eye, and caused bruising to my kidneys. 

Once the doctor determined that I was ok to be released, they realized that I had nowhere to go. They contacted the local domestic violence shelter where I had stayed before and they were full. I ended up at the city homeless shelter, where I had been attacked before. That shelter is full of drugs and violence, in fact, the police were called that night for a fight involving 5 men, one of which ended up in the hospital in critical condition. After a sleepless night on a hard cot, I spent the day at social services trying to find a place to stay. I was still in my pajamas and slippers from the morning I left. Thankfully the shelter placed me in a hotel room. I have been moved from hotel to hotel since then and have slowly been trying to get my life back. It’s difficult but at least I am away from him and safe.

So today I got so upset that I called the police to see how they could help me.
My (30F) partner (30M) has been yelling at my kids and I in a really threatening and scary manner to the point that I never feel 100% safe at home... and I never want to leave the kids alone with him...

Well today the police told me it sounds like I need a restraining order put in place and they will come and get him on Friday to serve him and to tell him to get out, that he can’t live here anymore etc...

I feel terrible... I love this man but he can’t treat me and my kids this way... but I am scared that the restraining order might be a bit of overkill but I just can’t think of any other way they could help me keep him away and out of my house etc...

I feel so guilty and like I am making a mountain out of a molehill because it’s not like he is hitting us etc..
I just don’t think I could break up with him safely without this?

WHAT DO I DO?

I know my childhood made me go on to pick a piece of shit like him as a partner because my needs were far from met and yay me I found a guy who will help with everything. Turns out he did that for awhile and that's because I did whatever he asked but then he stopped helping me altogether and just turned very abusive. I don't want to feel sorry for myself anymore.

We have since moved on to a city pretty far away, and are finally feeling safe 3 years later.  I personally check up on her abuser (carefully and only through social media) to make sure he isnt up to any schemes that could put us in danger.

I recently discovered he is engaged again. He gets engaged very fast after dating, and its through all sorts of coercion and manipulation that he got my girfriend to submit to his request that got her trapped. They have a wedding website set up for a wedding that will take place in 2021. Every bit of evidence screams she is about to experience the same dangerous situation. Though he did show signs of being an abuser early on, the guy flipped a serious switch after the marriage.

On one hand, I feel relieved that my girlfriend may be ultimately safe from a very unstable man who would obsess over her if he were not moving on.  But I just cant help feeling like I am the only one who knows what will happen to this poor woman (My girflriend doesnt know of the engagement) .  


I have 2 tough questions:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Do I tell my girlfriend that he has recently gotten engaged, in hopes that she will feel safer and her anxiety and trauma decrease? Or is it just better to not bring this up and pretend like I know nothing?  


2) Is there anything I can do or should do to help the woman recently engaged to him, who will no doubt have her life ruined, if not completely eliminated by this violent and manipulative man?  Or do I need to move on myself, let it be, in order to not endanger my own girlfriend?

I needed my friends the most at the time in my life but I had to go through it alone (some other friends had decided to side with my best friend).

I cannot believe I stayed in such a shitty relationship because I consider myself to be very independent and not submissive. He had me wrapped around his finger and I found myself changing and bending my morals just to be with him. 

I told myself the slapping, choking and biting was just a kink of his. I told him he was hurting me but he insisted on doing these things because he would be aroused. The biting hurt so much that I would silently scream, just waiting for the moment to be over. When he slapped me, I felt so worthless. I found myself holding on because I was so scared to let go. 
I feared how he would react if I left him. I stayed in this toxic relationship for half a year until he decided that I wasn’t good enough for him and dumped me.

So I ran with my four children in the middle of the night to get away from my abusive husband. My friend picked us up and took us two hours and 45 mins away to her house to be safe. I have a preemie who is 7 pounds now ..a two year old...9 year old...and 12 year old. Apparently in the midst of grabbing everything from the house I forgot my wic Similac neosure for my baby and I just ran COMPLETELY out and no money to buy any and I honestly do not know what to do..I'm so scared. My friend who we moved in with is out of funds and I have no family. I called the pediatricians around here and none have any samples and hospital says they have a shortage for labor and delivery only right now. I am at a loss and so scared...anyone have any ideas because I'm out of all...oh the two local food banks here do not have ANY formula...idk I need prayers and help

I just want to give up but I know I can not do that because I am all that my four babies have. Especially now that I left and pretty much us 5 is all we have.. we have no other family and the only friend that we have is the one that is allowing us to live with her until we can get on our feet to get our own house. 

I just feel so hopeless and useless because I cannot even provide for my own children what kind of mother am I? Maybe I shouldn't have left or maybe I should go back and just deal with it for the well being of my children I do not know what to do or what to think I honestly just feel like a failure what I mean is I have failed as a mother... A wife..and  just a woman in general!! 

I CALLED SIMILAC AND THEY ARE GOING TO SEND ME SOME FORMULA BUT IT TAKES AROUND 14 DAYS TO PROCESS THE ORDER THEN THEY SHIP IT OUT SO THE LADY ON THE PHONE SAID I CAN EXPECT IT AROUND 20 TO 30 DAYS OR A MONTH PRETTY MUCH. I ALSO CALLED WIC TWICE ACTUALLY, AND TALK TO TWO DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND EXPLAINED MY SITUATION AND THEY CHECKED AND THEY HAVE NO SAMPLES OR EXTRAS OF ANY KIND OF FORMULA.  THEY GAVE ME THE SOONEST APPOINTMENT THEY COULD WHICH IS THIS COMING THURSDAY. BUT I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT SOMETHING NOW BECAUSE WE ARE COMPLETELY OUT OF THE SIMILAC NEOSURE NOW. I HAVE NONE TO GIVE MY SON SO I HAVE BEEN CALLING MESSAGING AND DOING EVERYTHING I CAN THINK OF TO AT LEAST COME UP WITH THE $24 TO BUY A CAN TO AT LEAST LAST TILL WIC APPOINTMENT THURSDAY. 

I HAD ASKED ALL MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY THE LOAN ME SOME MONEY OR TO EVEN SEND A VIRTUAL GIFT CARD AND I TOLD THEM I WOULD PAY THEM BACK FRIDAY AT MIDNIGHT TRIPLE THE AMOUNT.

My husband tends to snap at me a lot. Not even in moments of stress, but in every day conversation, like harsh, aggressive tone, etc. In the past I've told him that it starts to affect my self-esteem and makes me wonder what's wrong with me and why can't he just speak to me nicely. For several months he was working on it and it stopped being a problem, but since the pandemic started he's started to do it again more often on a day to day basis. 


The last time it happened was last week. We were eating and he had to suddenly run into work and all I did was remind him of something related to his job he had told me about earlier. This led to him snapping at me that he already knew, etc. When he got home he apologized, but then got mad at me because I was still upset??? and said why can't he apologize and we just move on? It was hard for me to immediately move on because the snapping was happening every single day leading up to that incident. Like at that point it was the culmination of being snapped at day after day. He didn't get it at first but then he ended up apologizing again and explained he was stressed with work and took it out on me and was sorry. But then he added that I push him and he felt like I was ""challenging him"" when I said the work reminder, which is why he snapped at me. It feels like he started with an apology for his behavior but then put the blame on me? He said he would continue to work on it and since last week we haven't had any issues but idk. I wasn't trying to push him or challenge him and just wanted to remind him of something. I just dont get what I did that was so wrong? Any advice helps. I did kind of confront him that it feels kind of abusive sometimes when this happens and he started asking, ""Do you really think I'm an abuser?"" and saying how hurt he was that I'd even say that and then I felt guilty for thinking that.",domesticviolence,Is this verbal or emotional abuse or am I overreacting?,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/hcbfp4/is_this_verbal_or_emotional_abuse_or_am_i/,True

&amp;#x200B;

I feel way to embarassed to go to my Dr about this and Im a hypochondriac so maybe Im thinking to much on it.

&amp;#x200B;

Im 29, really fat and partially blind so I don't get out much. I have a pretty face but not much else. I have no friends and my idea of a wet dream is when dream men hold my hand. My family has been belittling me about being almost 30 with no friends, boyfriend or life pretty much since my birthday. Though I just finally graduated college with my BA.🤷🏻‍♀️

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway an ex hit me up the other day. Like the last guy I ever dated eight years ago. He was a charming douche but I still kinda had fun with him and he was the first guy I had more than one consensual sexual encounter with at 22. Even though Iv never really liked it and he would always say ""your welcome"" after like ge did me the favor so I dumped him.

&amp;#x200B;

But yesterday I was desperate and dumb and here was some rare attention so I cleaned up my apartment, got as nice looking as I could and he came over saying he would only stay for like a half hour and talk and stuff cuz I told him I might not feel the best. But I really liked the feeling of being hugged and cuddled. Its not something   
I ever get to feel and he knows how pathetic I am so I know he used that to charm me. And so my dumb brain turned off and I gave in to his advances. I thought this time I would be assertive and a strong women and try not to care about my fat body while he had a nice one. Plus I had ovarian surgery last year and haven't been able to reach orgasm since (though never had issues before blah) and thought I would try once with a person instead of myself to see if it could fix me.   
It was ok at first. Though he is kinda on the small penis end he is a huge guy. Back in the day he always begged me for blow jobs and I never gave in because I told him it reminded me of bad stuff I went through as a kid and grosses me out. But 29 year old me has been through therapy and wanted to be confident so I did it and that's when I noticed he wasn't simply douchy like long ago he started saying a lot of degrading things to me and forcing my arms and head to do things even when I tried to pull away. Then when he tried normal way out of nowhere he started strangling me. Im 5ft2 and he is 6ft3 with large hands and it shocked me a lot. I started struggling and he just squeezed harder. I never passed out and could kinda breath tiny kinda trying to kick him off. but my veins felt really restricted. He's really strong so I could not move his hands. But he let up and I was too shocked to say anything but then he kept randomly doing it off and on. I am not sure if I froze and thats why I didnt have the courage to end it there. But I am a people pleaser I guess and he had driven far so I felt bad and didn't want to disappoint him or irritate him. At that point I just was screaming in my head for it to end and starting thinking of scape options like how to make him happy so it will stop in my head but I still pretended to enjoy it a little and pretended everything was fine and pretended to be the confident woman like I had read about trying to be. And then he put a pillow over my head and was preasing down on my mouth area. When I freed my mouth gasping for air he fought me to keep it on and kept trying to stop me breathing and it took me a couple minutes to get it away. Or felt that way. Then he acted like he was all nice and tried touching me and holding me down so I pretended to like it so it would be over faster. But it wasn't and he forced my head to do other things that were a lot more painful and degrading than the how to articals described. I did managed a loud awkward no with one disgusting unforgivable reqest and keep my head away despite the yanking till he moved on. So I was kinda panicking now inside but still trying to make him happy so he would finish and leave. Heck I even smiled and laughed awkwardly trying to talk about things when I got the chance to breath freely but he kept telling me to shut up. Though I know he knew he was hurting me at times because when I couldn't hold the fake enjoyment it made him happier and he strangled me a few more times randomly even though I was clawing and kicking at him. By the end I just did what he wanted plastered a fake smile on my face because if he would just be done it would stop. At least that was my thinking. When it was over, after he said he would just finish ""on me"" but then forced it in my mouth to do it there, nasty grossest crap, and made a few more rude remarks it was over. Throughout it he also pretended the condom fell off and kept going though I told him there was another and seemed to mumble something about being pregnant already idk. Hopefully my dud ovary and blocked tube does its job. He also slapped my body several times throughout. He was all pleased with himself and I just kinda obvious fake laughed it off awkwardly kinda but thinking back I was in a scared disgusted daze at the same time. And then he just left trying to be charming and give me a hug and mumbled something about next time and I got kinda mad finally and said ""next time? il be hurting you"" he laughed and I pushed him out the door. I also said ""Your Welcome"" as I shut it just as a throwback. So my self confidence apparently only kickes in when I don't have a giant sergeant holding me down of course ugh.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like a damn fool for even thinking of trusting anyone to touch me. And I feel like an even bigger fool for being so nice as to not be able to stick up for myself when I wanted to escape. I have a hard time believing he thought 100% I was actually enjoying myself by the way he would look and treat me. But he is such a strong tall military guy and I'm short fat and weak so I could not actually stop him from doing these things. But if I said no go away he probably would have if not sulking like when we were young. But than if he could act this differently than before maybe not? I knew he would be a douche but I felt kinda helpess and hurt though I could have stoped it idk. Should have. I was like a man handled ragdoll. And he knew for a fact I was not into bdsm type stuff cuz right before we were talking about movies scrolling by on netflix and he mentioned the 50 Shades movie and I said it was dumb and would never do that stuff..

But its not like he assaulted me though cuz I consented. I didn't consent to the bad stuff but I couldn't say no either though and I tried and did start kicking and making like ""stop noises"". Which he ignored and made it worse.

&amp;#x200B;

Lost story short my throat and neck hurt and I feel like a disgusting piece if slutty meat now when yesterday I felt like a happy content nun watching my cartoons with my cat.   


I feel violated and hurt. But I smiled and let him continue so it could be over faster. Plus I didn't wana make him mad or sonething. Not that I was afraid he'd hit me just I hate disappointing people. But maybe I should have been afraid and I am really disapointed in myself.

&amp;#x200B;

Today my neck feels tight kind of. I thought my anxiety was just making it feel that way. And sore throat is a given. But I just did a short workout and I can feel the blood pulse and rush through my neck and its really unerving and I hate it and now my neck feels like its still being strangled a little but I have no bruise. Can breathe fine despite soreness in my throat. But the internet said people can drop dead days after even a little bit of that. Im scared. Id rather die than humiliate myself with going to the doctor and explaining it and since I cant drive Id have to explain to my master at belittling me sister to get there. But has anyone else felt this? Will it get better? Its just still fresh and maybe a little bruised inside? Google is giving me visions of my blood vessels snapping, strokes or esophagus being partially crushed without realizing it. Though   
I'm eating fine Id rather not randomly die in a few days. The sensation is just bothering me mentally bad.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice?

&amp;#x200B;

For the record Im just going to stick to dream men for the rest of my life. Im not someone who trusts easily and now I realize its not worth even involving myself with anyone. Even more so when Im broken sexually and cant feel stuff anyway. I literally just did it as an experiment and to make him happy so I could get some hugs from a human being. I feel so gross now like my body and mouth are contaminated and I should not touch anything, eat food, or kiss even my cats or family now like I will spread the nastiness of what I did to things I love.

I'll try not to make this longer than it needs to be. 
My best friend (20 f) is in an abusive relationship &amp; its getting worse, they've been together for three years &amp; it's all abuse expect for sexual (that I'm aware of). She already has a lot going on with uni &amp; trying to improve her mental health, I don't want her to stay in this relationship while it just gets worse &amp; worse &amp; by the time she leaves.. If she does... She has even more, harder, stuff to work on.
The problem is, I'm a teenager &amp; I also live in a different state to her. She's come to stay with me before when things were bad but that was only for a week so she could have a “break“.
As you can tell, I'm a bit helpless.
I've offered to her for her to come live with me &amp; my family permanently as my family has been thru domestic violence &amp; we have given people a place to stay many times. My offer wasn't long ago &amp; I told her i/we could help her move up her around January time so she could have time to change unis &amp; settle in, that stuff. She just seems really reluctant to really take on help or even help herself as harsh as that sounds because she is so used to living in a DV situation (she moved in with her bfs family almost two years ago to get away from her families abuse) &amp; she also has bpd which makes leaving very hard to put it simple, if you have bpd is you get what I mean. Plus she has no friends or family there that she can go with. She only has me &amp; some of my friends up here.

I've spoken to my mum about it &amp; she told me I need to be straightforward with my friend which I have been because as we all know this is so serious &amp; dangerous &amp; friends have to be honest with eachother regardless. She told me I need to tell my friend to search for resources &amp; shelerts &amp; for her not to tell anyone (of course) &amp; reassure her that people will help her because of the situation she's in. I've told her this all. I've even given her resources to look into but she just won't take it. She's scared too &amp; I asked her how isn't she more scared to stay in this situation? He's only bringing her down &amp; he will only get worse. He's a manipulater &amp; he's gaslighting you. I said stuff like that in a caring way.she comes to me for support mostly &amp; I know that I can't “save“ her, she needs to save herself but it's honestly scary &amp; I don't want her to end up dead which is worst case situation. 

What can I do to help my friend? I know she has to want to help herself but what are some resources I can at least recommend to her (shelters, support groups, therapy centres ect) that might help her make the first step? She lives in West Melbourne Victoria AUS. what would you say if this was your friend to try to convince them? What would you do?

I'm selling my house, the house I was abused in for over a year. I'm currently detaching from my partner and working on healing but occasionally he comes back (he moved back with his dad just 5 miles away), lets himself in, etc. I let it happen and try avoid conflict because I know that until the house is sold, because we're so close geographically, I'm not safe.

This man has no care for the law, does what he wants, thinks he's above the law and isn't bothered about facing the police, punishment, or even jail time. If I fully broke things off with him now he would definitely, 100%, destroy the house and make it unsellable (at least to the current buyer who has a mortgage) - or at the very least keep me here much longer and closer to him! He wants to control my life.

So I will sell, and run. I have a buyer so within a couple of months I should be outta here, woooo! That said, I'm a young entrepreneur and own my home outright. He did some renovation work when we moved in, maybe £2-4k worth. We were in a happy relationship at this time and never discussed payment. Legally, he's entitled to nothing.

That said, he expects 50% (around £50,000). I have a voice recording of him saying:

&gt;'whatever you get from here, half of that is going in my account, which is payment for building this fucking shithole, that's taken up 3 years of my life with you, you miserable fucking piece of shit. if you don't, I will dedicate the rest of my fucking life to killing you, you fucking asshole'.

I will be moving back to nearer my hometown, about 40 miles away, but it's just a short train ride away. How can I get help and protect myself? I only have unclear images of physical abuse (I think because I'm so pale the camera doesn't pick up well, and he's never left bruises or serious marks/cuts), the only thing I have as hard 'evidence' is the recording - so even if I tried to press charges the highest charge he'd get is common assault? Even then, for a common assault offence to have taken place, the threat must be immediate, so the charge would fail.

What am I supposed to do to ensure my safety? The police in the UK are awful at protecting people, and so many domestic abuse victims die \*after\* the relationship ended.

To give you an idea of my partner, he had already been in prison twice for domestic violence previously and has spent approx 14 years in prison for a myriad of offences in total. 
 My first boyfriend, 21 years my senior and the first man who spontaneously opened up the capacity for romantic love for the opposite sex after a life time of sexual violence, has just been arrested for domestic violence; finally. 

He was the person who taught me what it meant to ‘light up a room’ through free expression of his effervescent charisma, whilst also being the person who made me walk on egg shells for fear he would permanently scar or kill me. 

He’s threatened to throw acid in my face, kill me in a multitude of ways (such as ‘stab/slice me up and leave me begging for mercy’), kick my head in on multiple occasions, arrange for people in my town 20 years older and in his 40-odd year old age bracket to beat me up. He’s called up the organisation who manages where I live and tried to intentionally make me homeless by telling them discriminatory and incriminating information about me. I’ve trusted him with information that I have never told anyone, running along the theme of childhood sexual abuse, just for him to turn around and use that information as golden ammunition to assassinate, blackmail me with, and threaten to post all over Facebook. 

He’s hyper possessive, jealous, and up until now only been emotionally and mentally abusive. He has had me genuinely believe I wasn’t worth shit and that I really was a fat, useless whore who no one else would want which were words repeatedly uttered from his lips. That ‘my pussy wasn’t worth shit’, and that I really was ‘shit in bed’ amongst other things. 

He was like Jekyll and Hyde, night and day. It was very confusing having my best friend and lover to be so nasty and full of cruel hate.  

Well I really tried to avoid getting the police involved and even called up his probation officer as a professional alternative after he threatened to throw acid in my face and tried to make me homeless - hoping he perhaps could speak some sense into him. 
Well today it finally happened, the next step on his linear progression of abuse: after yet again accusing me of sleeping with a vast array of people, (which has never been true), he got up, walked over to the bed which I was sitting and planted three punches to my face and jaw. I started screaming, so he picked up a pillow and started telling me to shut the fuck up - I watched his face calculate his thought process as he proceeded to pick up a large glass bottle. 
‘Is this guy going to finally kill me by smothering me with this pillow he’s grasping? Or is he going to hit me with this bottle instead?’ I thought - I honestly didn’t care, I just carried on screaming as to set off an alarm for the neighbour next door. 

She let me call the police on her phone after he had decorated my face and stole my phone before running from the building. The police came and they asked me a million questions - not just about the current event, but our general dynamic and concluded that they wanted to prosecute him also with coercive control. 
As I was doing my statement, he turned up back at the house with a face like a slapped arse and an apology. He looked poignant and remorseful as the police snapped him in handcuffs, “you’re not going to press charges are you babe?” he asked.
Truth is that I don’t know, but I’m gutted that I’ve lost my best friend and partner. 
He’s on license as he came out of prison in July last year, so chances are he’ll be recalled and’ll be going back there for a few months to complete his sentence behind bars.

I consider my dad to be an emotionally abusive man, but it was not his fault. I forgave him long ago and have a lot of empathy now. When I was a junior in high school I had 0 self esteem and severe anxiety because of my dad. It was then that I met my ex fiancee (let's call him Chad).

Chad was charming at first. We were happy. I was head over heels for him until we went to college. Then he started to withdraw. He wouldn't visit me (I went to a school about 2 hours from him). He was emotionally unavailable. I was a freshman. I had no self esteem. I was lost. I transferred to be with him (it was a much better school and I have no regrets for other reasons). The relationship took an even more toxic turn. He would pressure me to have sex with other women (I am bisexual but am not so into the multiple partners at the same time thing). He would pressure me into threesomes. He was a habitual cheater. He was constantly encouraging me to fuck other people I didn't want to fuck so he could feel better about doing it behind my back. All the while he reminded me constantly how worthless I was, and how lucky I was he loved me because no one else ever would. There was at least one night when he pressured me I to sex I absolutely did not want, and I cried a lot after.

Then we got engaged and moved. He graduated college late and wanted to go to law school. He moved to be with me and contributed 0 to the household. I had 3 jobs for a while to keep us afloat while he played go on the internet. He refused to take me on dates. He was terrible with money and wouldn't let me spend anything myself, but would buy gadgets often. He refused to get a job. But still I was lucky to have him. 

He started to pressure me to have sex with my girlfriends, either alone or in front of him. He would find other women and pressure me into sleeping with them. I contracted an STD from one of these encounters. He went on dates with other women and told me about them. He tried to fuck my friends. He had a mistress who was a friend's ex (this happened a lot) who he fucked for years. He didn't try to hide it. He often told me how much better she was than me. He started law school, did terribly at it, and reminded me constantly that I was the reason he was failing.

He wanted me to be something sexually that I wasn't. He would dress me up in BDSM lingerie and clothes. He would complain I wasn't sexy enough or didn't meet his needs. He told me what to wear. He constantly demeaned my looks or clothing choices. By the end he was telling me to wear sexual clothes that made me uncomfortable.

I should have left, but he told me that I promised to love him unconditionally. I though no one would want me. That I was disgusting. I stayed for 10 years. I believed I was worthless. I only got out because I developed a crush that let me see things more clearly (he did not like me back). 

Now I'm married to a great guy but I feel cut off from him and totally numb. We made some unrelated mistakes. He was selfish early on and steamrolled me. I didn't have a voice. He NEVER would do anything to hurt me. But I feel so numb.

Can anyone help me describe what my ex was and did? He never hit me, so I never understood what was happening as abuse.  Everything I try to use to talk about it feels wrong.

Something told my gut to get ahold of her and sure enough my gut was right. I don't need to tell everything but I can say that he has tied to kill her and he was arrested and bailed out the next day by his parents. She didn't get the proper help she needed by the victims advocate and lied about that happened even though she had hand marks around her neck. He has said he was going to kill her and her 2 kids several times. So one time she I didn't hear from her for a month and I begged her to just tell me she was ok that's all I needed to know. She agreed and said sorry. So I fucked up I got upset another month went by I left her text messages voice mail and nothing back. I got upset because I been working so hard to help her and get her help I fucked up and sent her some messages I regret nothing mean just how my feelings are hurt and I love her and always are there for her and all I asked for her is to tell me she was alright.

Btw she hasn't told anyone what's really going on she was a foster child and doesn't have parents or a supportive family just her brother she talks to. The husband family is in denial and blames both of them for the so called drama and doesn't realize she is in deep danger. I had been working with a detective about 6 months ago to get enough evidence to charge him with attempted murder and we had everything but her statement that's all he needed. but he does tell her all the time how he's going to kill her and the kids drive off a cliff drive into the barrier he's going to kill himself he's already shot a gun in the house with the kids.

I live separately from them in my grandma's house with her friend (he take care of her). I'm writing this at 2am while crying, so it might lack detail/not correct wording - ask questions if you need.

After they got married, they had a baby daughter. Before she was born, I remember my mum coming home early in the morning after being out all night. I was staying up for her, and when she came home she was crying. It got a lot of asking, but she told me that he punched her in the stomach (she was 2 months into the pregnancy).

After that incident, something else happened. I'm not sure clearly about what did, but she had accidently cut him after he tried to grab a knife from her in the kitchen (he was drunk) which resulted in him having a big cut on his finger. He called the police, and before they came, he began throwing death threats at me (I was in the living room and he was at the door of it yelling at mr). He told me that if I didn't get out of the house when he returned (from the hospital), that he would kill me and my whole family. This might have happened after the police came, but I'm not sure. He also yelled at me, calling me things like bitch, slut, etc. My grandma came to pick me up. He never apologised, but my mum forgave him.

Nothing really happened for the two years, apart from him continually yelling things at my mum like bitch, slut, saying she was useless, telling her not to do certain things, etc. I also remember him threatening to kick my mum out of the house, when they lived in their old house. He would always hit me, jab me with his hand in a way, but play it off as a joke.

Something else happened last month though. Me, my mum, and my little sister (around 1 year and 3 months old) had went out and we came back to their new house. The house is one floor, it was a living room, bathroom, kitchen, and bedroom. When he came home, he began drinking. Me and my mum went to the bedroom, to put my little sister to sleep, while he was in the living room. My little sister was crying a lot, but we still tried to put her to sleep. She's quite stubborn, lol. I took her from my mum, and had her on my upper body, trying to make her sleep. He came into the bedroom, and tried to take her away from me. I said that it was okay and that I can get her to sleep, but he still tried to take her away from me. At first he was just trying to take her, but then he began to grab my hands really hard and sort of jab them (like he was trying to dig his nails into my hands, but with his fingers?) but I kept persistenting. He became more violent in doing it, until he took his hand and put it around my neck, really hard, and began squeezing it until I could barely breathe and felt my vision going away a bit. I called the police. While I was on the phone with them, I was in the kitchen and he was in the living room (they're opposite from the house), he kept yelling at me saying he was going to kill me by cutting/stabbing me, he kept calling me things like bitch, slut, he kept saying that he didnt want a disabled person in the house (I'm blind in one eye), he kept saying to me to leave and that this would be the last time I would be in the house. When the police came after 10 minutes, I explained what happen and told them about the incident of where he threatened me. They asked questions on his previous behaviour, and I told them. They said that the only thing they could do is take me home.

After the incident, I kept having suicidal thoughts. I also had thoughts that he was going to come to me and kill me, like he would find me in the street and bash my head against the pavement, or how he was going to come to my house and kill me. As it's my birthday in a month, my mum told me she was going to come to my house with him and my sister to give me cake. I told her I didnt want him to come, and she asked me why. I told her how he made me feel, about the thoughts I had. She told me to think about how hard it was for her to bring the cake while with my little sister. I told her I also self harm because of it, and she told me I did it before what he did (this is true, but I also did it after/as result of what he did). She doesnt try to help me, and she keeps on defending him by saying he was angry, or how he has problems with his job, etc (this is also the same for when he threaten me the first time). She told me she would help me, and that she loved me more than him. My grandma bashes me for it, after what happen I didnt leave me room for a week/eat and she keeps saying about how it affected her. Because my mum bring my sister for us to take care of her when she work, he has to come and pick her up after 4PM. I leave to go upstairs so I dont have to see him, and my grandma said ""you're leaving like someone will hurt you"" (I'm not sure how to translate it).

My mum says she cant leave him because she doesn't want to live in my grandmas house ""under control"", and how she wont have money if she leaves (she has job, but I dont think it give much money)

I met with a lawyer. I’m still in the planning stages of filing for divorce. I hope a position opens up near my parents several hours away so I can transfer near them with my employer. But with COVID and ability to work from home, I may not need to do that even.

I don’t want to have my husband served while at work.  The lawyer said I can just tell him that I’m filing and my lawyer just needs to know where to serve him and then suggest he obtain a lawyer and the lawyer can serve him divorce papers through his lawyer. 

We have child so it will need to go through mediation and requires 90 day waiting period so I don’t want to wait too much  longer. It would be easier if the children were back in school to have this conversation with him. But with COVID, I’m also scared to have this conversation with him while home alone.  So at this rate, I probably won’t file until end of August.

He is an addict and abuses steroids, and his mood swings are explosive and dangerous. He strangles her at family dinners, hits, screams at, and threatens her, and has pushed her out of moving vehicles more than once (all while pregnant).

In a little green book hidden amongst hundreds of others. I try to correlate dates to see if the events have significance, I'm yet to find anything. It is random but it happens at least once a year.

Sometimes I think I am lucky, God gifted me with poor sight. Once the glasses get knocked off it's all a blur ... literally.

The difficulty lies in dealing with the aftermath, helplessly running fingers across the wooden floor; porcelain, crystal glass and dirt those are my finds that day.

This is my life story.

I am 30 year old female living in india. I got married At 22. It was an arrange marriage. After marriage I started noticing that my husband gets angry very quickly for small things like why snacks are not ready when he reaches home from office. Why there there is less salt in food. As I got married straight out the college I dint know cooking at all. I was learning to cook after marriage. But I adjusted to all that and learned to cook soon. Bit he still would complain that I don't cook like his mom. I should learn from his mother.  When he gets angry and shouts at me his language becomes very bad and will abuse me verbally. 

I had told all this to my mother, she told me its OK its alright, just don't make him angry. Behave nicely with him do everything for him. Keep him happy. 

After 1 year of marriage his mother started asking for kids. Before getting married he had suggested that we will wait for 3 years after marriage I had also agreed to it as I dint wanted to have kids immediately.
But when his mother started asking him, he started to force me for it. As I was taking contraceptive pills. He forced me to stop taking those. But I asked him to give me some time, give me 3 months I will get my health in good condition as i was anemic, so that in 3 months i can improve my haemoglobin level and then try for pregnancy. He dint agree for it and forced me to have sex without my consent. I was crying all the time and he started to shout at me saying what are u crying for, you are crying as if I raped you. 

After a month I got pregnant. But that pregnancy resulted in miscarriage.
Once the miscarriage happened his mother blamed me stating that as I was taking contraceptive pills, I got miscarriage and I am not fit to bear children. He also agreed to it and that resulted in big fight. My parents also got involved, his parents also got involved. The fight was big. He had clearly told that you cannot come back until your parents apologize to my parents, as your parents have spoken a lot about me.
I tried to make him understand as we have married we should try to work on the relationship if parents are having a fight let them have there fights should not affect our relationship.
In spite of him saying don't come. I went to stay with him, after I went thats when the physical abuse started. The first time he hit me I told my mom about it she said is ok it happened only once, it won't happen again. Then I got pregnant.  But the verbal abuse was still present. Once my daughter was born. Physically hitting me, shouting at me, forcing me to have sex. Even if I say no he would force me to do it. While I am sleeping he would come and remove my pants and do sex with me. When I question him for such kind of behavior he says he does it for relaxation purpose. All this continued. When my daughter was 5 years he hit me a lot. Thats when I took my daughter and went to parents place. Told my parents that i am not going back to that house and i want a divorce. But my parents never believed me they say that I should adjust and live there. They thought I was depressed and they took me for counselling so that I do not talk about divorce and go back there. My parents also physically hit me, and they sent my daughter to husband's house. When I question my parents they say that I do not deserve to a mother. They say that in every marriage there is violence you should learn to adjust for your daughter. My parents took away my money and then they forced me to go back to that house. I told them clearly that I will not live in that house I will go away some where else. But they said we don't care what you do but you should go back to that house.
they sent me back. I lived at my husband house for 1 month then I left the house. Sent an email to police and to husband stating that I am leaving the house. I took up a job in another city and I am living in a hostel now.

Now I am preparing for divorce and custody of my daughter.
 But at times I feel guilty that I left my daughter in that house.

I could not accept what was happening in the moment so I ignored it. I was in a relationship where I was being physically and emotionally abused. 

My best friend assumed I was sneaking around with her ex behind her back and blocked me everywhere, I tried to talk to her but she never answered. This same guy got close to me and wanted me to be with him, and I never wanted to be, but it quickly developed into an emotionally and physically abusive relationship. I needed my friends the most at the time in my life but I had to go through it alone (some other friends had decided to side with my best friend).

I cannot believe I stayed in such a shitty relationship because I consider myself to be very independent and not submissive. He had me wrapped around his finger and I found myself changing and bending my morals just to be with him. 

I told myself the slapping, choking and biting was just a kink of his. I told him he was hurting me but he insisted on doing these things because he would be aroused. The biting hurt so much that I would silently scream, just waiting for the moment to be over. When he slapped me, I felt so worthless. I found myself holding on because I was so scared to let go. 
I feared how he would react if I left him. I stayed in this toxic relationship for half a year until he decided that I wasn’t good enough for him and dumped me.

So I ran with my four children in the middle of the night to get away from my abusive husband. My friend picked us up and took us two hours and 45 mins away to her house to be safe. I have a preemie who is 7 pounds now ..a two year old...9 year old...and 12 year old. Apparently in the midst of grabbing everything from the house I forgot my wic Similac neosure for my baby and I just ran COMPLETELY out and no money to buy any and I honestly do not know what to do..I'm so scared. My friend who we moved in with is out of funds and I have no family. I called the pediatricians around here and none have any samples and hospital says they have a shortage for labor and delivery only right now. I am at a loss and so scared...anyone have any ideas because I'm out of all...oh the two local food banks here do not have ANY formula...idk I need prayers and help

I just want to give up but I know I can not do that because I am all that my four babies have. Especially now that I left and pretty much us 5 is all we have.. we have no other family and the only friend that we have is the one that is allowing us to live with her until we can get on our feet to get our own house. 

I just feel so hopeless and useless because I cannot even provide for my own children what kind of mother am I? Maybe I shouldn't have left or maybe I should go back and just deal with it for the well being of my children I do not know what to do or what to think I honestly just feel like a failure what I mean is I have failed as a mother... A wife..and  just a woman in general!! 

I CALLED SIMILAC AND THEY ARE GOING TO SEND ME SOME FORMULA BUT IT TAKES AROUND 14 DAYS TO PROCESS THE ORDER THEN THEY SHIP IT OUT SO THE LADY ON THE PHONE SAID I CAN EXPECT IT AROUND 20 TO 30 DAYS OR A MONTH PRETTY MUCH. I ALSO CALLED WIC TWICE ACTUALLY, AND TALK TO TWO DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND EXPLAINED MY SITUATION AND THEY CHECKED AND THEY HAVE NO SAMPLES OR EXTRAS OF ANY KIND OF FORMULA.  THEY GAVE ME THE SOONEST APPOINTMENT THEY COULD WHICH IS THIS COMING THURSDAY. BUT I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT SOMETHING NOW BECAUSE WE ARE COMPLETELY OUT OF THE SIMILAC NEOSURE NOW. I HAVE NONE TO GIVE MY SON SO I HAVE BEEN CALLING MESSAGING AND DOING EVERYTHING I CAN THINK OF TO AT LEAST COME UP WITH THE $24 TO BUY A CAN TO AT LEAST LAST TILL WIC APPOINTMENT THURSDAY. 

I HAD ASKED ALL MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY THE LOAN ME SOME MONEY OR TO EVEN SEND A VIRTUAL GIFT CARD AND I TOLD THEM I WOULD PAY THEM BACK FRIDAY AT MIDNIGHT TRIPLE THE AMOUNT.

My husband tends to snap at me a lot. Not even in moments of stress, but in every day conversation, like harsh, aggressive tone, etc. In the past I've told him that it starts to affect my self-esteem and makes me wonder what's wrong with me and why can't he just speak to me nicely. For several months he was working on it and it stopped being a problem, but since the pandemic started he's started to do it again more often on a day to day basis. 


The last time it happened was last week. We were eating and he had to suddenly run into work and all I did was remind him of something related to his job he had told me about earlier. This led to him snapping at me that he already knew, etc. When he got home he apologized, but then got mad at me because I was still upset??? and said why can't he apologize and we just move on? It was hard for me to immediately move on because the snapping was happening every single day leading up to that incident. Like at that point it was the culmination of being snapped at day after day. He didn't get it at first but then he ended up apologizing again and explained he was stressed with work and took it out on me and was sorry. But then he added that I push him and he felt like I was ""challenging him"" when I said the work reminder, which is why he snapped at me. It feels like he started with an apology for his behavior but then put the blame on me? He said he would continue to work on it and since last week we haven't had any issues but idk. I wasn't trying to push him or challenge him and just wanted to remind him of something. I just dont get what I did that was so wrong? Any advice helps.

My overall question though if you don't want to read id how long does it take you to feel better after ""minor"" strangulation?

&amp;#x200B;

I feel way to embarassed to go to my Dr about this and Im a hypochondriac so maybe Im thinking to much on it.

&amp;#x200B;

Im 29, really fat and partially blind so I don't get out much. I have a pretty face but not much else. I have no friends and my idea of a wet dream is when dream men hold my hand. My family has been belittling me about being almost 30 with no friends, boyfriend or life pretty much since my birthday. Though I just finally graduated college with my BA.🤷🏻‍♀️

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway an ex hit me up the other day. Like the last guy I ever dated eight years ago. He was a charming douche but I still kinda had fun with him and he was the first guy I had more than one consensual sexual encounter with at 22. Even though Iv never really liked it and he would always say ""your welcome"" after like ge did me the favor so I dumped him.

&amp;#x200B;

But yesterday I was desperate and dumb and here was some rare attention so I cleaned up my apartment, got as nice looking as I could and he came over saying he would only stay for like a half hour and talk and stuff cuz I told him I might not feel the best. But I really liked the feeling of being hugged and cuddled. Its not something   
I ever get to feel and he knows how pathetic I am so I know he used that to charm me. And so my dumb brain turned off and I gave in to his advances. I thought this time I would be assertive and a strong women and try not to care about my fat body while he had a nice one. Plus I had ovarian surgery last year and haven't been able to reach orgasm since (though never had issues before blah) and thought I would try once with a person instead of myself to see if it could fix me.   
It was ok at first. Though he is kinda on the small penis end he is a huge guy. Back in the day he always begged me for blow jobs and I never gave in because I told him it reminded me of bad stuff I went through as a kid and grosses me out. But 29 year old me has been through therapy and wanted to be confident so I did it and that's when I noticed he wasn't simply douchy like long ago he started saying a lot of degrading things to me and forcing my arms and head to do things even when I tried to pull away. Then when he tried normal way out of nowhere he started strangling me. Im 5ft2 and he is 6ft3 with large hands and it shocked me a lot. I started struggling and he just squeezed harder. I never passed out and could kinda breath tiny kinda trying to kick him off. but my veins felt really restricted. He's really strong so I could not move his hands. But he let up and I was too shocked to say anything but then he kept randomly doing it off and on. I am not sure if I froze and thats why I didnt have the courage to end it there. But I am a people pleaser I guess and he had driven far so I felt bad and didn't want to disappoint him or irritate him. At that point I just was screaming in my head for it to end and starting thinking of scape options like how to make him happy so it will stop in my head but I still pretended to enjoy it a little and pretended everything was fine and pretended to be the confident woman like I had read about trying to be. And then he put a pillow over my head and was preasing down on my mouth area. When I freed my mouth gasping for air he fought me to keep it on and kept trying to stop me breathing and it took me a couple minutes to get it away. Or felt that way. Then he acted like he was all nice and tried touching me and holding me down so I pretended to like it so it would be over faster. But it wasn't and he forced my head to do other things that were a lot more painful and degrading than the how to articals described. I did managed a loud awkward no with one disgusting unforgivable reqest and keep my head away despite the yanking till he moved on. So I was kinda panicking now inside but still trying to make him happy so he would finish and leave. Heck I even smiled and laughed awkwardly trying to talk about things when I got the chance to breath freely but he kept telling me to shut up. Though I know he knew he was hurting me at times because when I couldn't hold the fake enjoyment it made him happier and he strangled me a few more times randomly even though I was clawing and kicking at him. By the end I just did what he wanted plastered a fake smile on my face because if he would just be done it would stop. At least that was my thinking. When it was over, after he said he would just finish ""on me"" but then forced it in my mouth to do it there, nasty grossest crap, and made a few more rude remarks it was over. Throughout it he also pretended the condom fell off and kept going though I told him there was another and seemed to mumble something about being pregnant already idk. Hopefully my dud ovary and blocked tube does its job. He also slapped my body several times throughout. He was all pleased with himself and I just kinda obvious fake laughed it off awkwardly kinda but thinking back I was in a scared disgusted daze at the same time. And then he just left trying to be charming and give me a hug and mumbled something about next time and I got kinda mad finally and said ""next time? il be hurting you"" he laughed and I pushed him out the door. I also said ""Your Welcome"" as I shut it just as a throwback. So my self confidence apparently only kickes in when I don't have a giant sergeant holding me down of course ugh.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like a damn fool for even thinking of trusting anyone to touch me. And I feel like an even bigger fool for being so nice as to not be able to stick up for myself when I wanted to escape. I have a hard time believing he thought 100% I was actually enjoying myself by the way he would look and treat me. But he is such a strong tall military guy and I'm short fat and weak so I could not actually stop him from doing these things. But if I said no go away he probably would have if not sulking like when we were young. But than if he could act this differently than before maybe not? I knew he would be a douche but I felt kinda helpess and hurt though I could have stoped it idk. Should have. I was like a man handled ragdoll. And he knew for a fact I was not into bdsm type stuff cuz right before we were talking about movies scrolling by on netflix and he mentioned the 50 Shades movie and I said it was dumb and would never do that stuff..

But its not like he assaulted me though cuz I consented. I didn't consent to the bad stuff but I couldn't say no either though and I tried and did start kicking and making like ""stop noises"". Which he ignored and made it worse.

Lost story short my throat and neck hurt and I feel like a disgusting piece if slutty meat now when yesterday I felt like a happy content nun watching my cartoons with my cat.   


I feel violated and hurt. But I smiled and let him continue so it could be over faster. Plus I didn't wana make him mad or sonething. Not that I was afraid he'd hit me just I hate disappointing people. But maybe I should have been afraid and I am really disapointed in myself.

&amp;#x200B;

Today my neck feels tight kind of. I thought my anxiety was just making it feel that way. And sore throat is a given. But I just did a short workout and I can feel the blood pulse and rush through my neck and its really unerving and I hate it and now my neck feels like its still being strangled a little but I have no bruise. Can breathe fine despite soreness in my throat. But the internet said people can drop dead days after even a little bit of that. Im scared. Id rather die than humiliate myself with going to the doctor and explaining it and since I cant drive Id have to explain to my master at belittling me sister to get there. But has anyone else felt this? Will it get better? Its just still fresh and maybe a little bruised inside? Google is giving me visions of my blood vessels snapping, strokes or esophagus being partially crushed without realizing it. Though   
I'm eating fine Id rather not randomly die in a few days. The sensation is just bothering me mentally bad.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice?

For the record Im just going to stick to dream men for the rest of my life. Im not someone who trusts easily and now I realize its not worth even involving myself with anyone. Even more so when Im broken sexually and cant feel stuff anyway. I literally just did it as an experiment and to make him happy so I could get some hugs from a human being. I feel so gross now like my body and mouth are contaminated and I should not touch anything, eat food, or kiss even my cats or family now like I will spread the nastiness of what I did to things I love.

I'll try not to make this longer than it needs to be. 
My best friend (20 f) is in an abusive relationship &amp; its getting worse, they've been together for three years &amp; it's all abuse expect for sexual (that I'm aware of). She already has a lot going on with uni &amp; trying to improve her mental health, I don't want her to stay in this relationship while it just gets worse &amp; worse &amp; by the time she leaves.. If she does... She has even more, harder, stuff to work on.
The problem is, I'm a teenager &amp; I also live in a different state to her. She's come to stay with me before when things were bad but that was only for a week so she could have a “break“.
As you can tell, I'm a bit helpless.
I've offered to her for her to come live with me &amp; my family permanently as my family has been thru domestic violence &amp; we have given people a place to stay many times. My offer wasn't long ago &amp; I told her i/we could help her move up her around January time so she could have time to change unis &amp; settle in, that stuff. She just seems really reluctant to really take on help or even help herself as harsh as that sounds because she is so used to living in a DV situation (she moved in with her bfs family almost two years ago to get away from her families abuse) &amp; she also has bpd which makes leaving very hard to put it simple, if you have bpd is you get what I mean. Plus she has no friends or family there that she can go with. She only has me &amp; some of my friends up here.

I've spoken to my mum about it &amp; she told me I need to be straightforward with my friend which I have been because as we all know this is so serious &amp; dangerous &amp; friends have to be honest with eachother regardless. She told me I need to tell my friend to search for resources &amp; shelerts &amp; for her not to tell anyone (of course) &amp; reassure her that people will help her because of the situation she's in. I've told her this all. I've even given her resources to look into but she just won't take it. She's scared too &amp; I asked her how isn't she more scared to stay in this situation? He's only bringing her down &amp; he will only get worse. He's a manipulater &amp; he's gaslighting you. I said stuff like that in a caring way.she comes to me for support mostly &amp; I know that I can't “save“ her, she needs to save herself but it's honestly scary &amp; I don't want her to end up dead which is worst case situation. 

What can I do to help my friend? I know she has to want to help herself but what are some resources I can at least recommend to her (shelters, support groups, therapy centres ect) that might help her make the first step? She lives in West Melbourne Victoria AUS. what would you say if this was your friend to try to convince them? What would you do?

I'm selling my house, the house I was abused in for over a year. I'm currently detaching from my partner and working on healing but occasionally he comes back (he moved back with his dad just 5 miles away), lets himself in, etc. I let it happen and try avoid conflict because I know that until the house is sold, because we're so close geographically, I'm not safe.

This man has no care for the law, does what he wants, thinks he's above the law and isn't bothered about facing the police, punishment, or even jail time. If I fully broke things off with him now he would definitely, 100%, destroy the house and make it unsellable (at least to the current buyer who has a mortgage) - or at the very least keep me here much longer and closer to him! He wants to control my life.

So I will sell, and run. I have a buyer so within a couple of months I should be outta here, woooo! That said, I'm a young entrepreneur and own my home outright. He did some renovation work when we moved in, maybe £2-4k worth. We were in a happy relationship at this time and never discussed payment. Legally, he's entitled to nothing.

That said, he expects 50% (around £50,000). I have a voice recording of him saying:

&gt;'whatever you get from here, half of that is going in my account, which is payment for building this fucking shithole, that's taken up 3 years of my life with you, you miserable fucking piece of shit. if you don't, I will dedicate the rest of my fucking life to killing you, you fucking asshole'.

I will be moving back to nearer my hometown, about 40 miles away, but it's just a short train ride away. How can I get help and protect myself? I only have unclear images of physical abuse (I think because I'm so pale the camera doesn't pick up well, and he's never left bruises or serious marks/cuts), the only thing I have as hard 'evidence' is the recording - so even if I tried to press charges the highest charge he'd get is common assault? Even then, for a common assault offence to have taken place, the threat must be immediate, so the charge would fail.

If you are not familiar with Brené Brown, she is a research professor at the University of Houston and has spent the past two decades studying courage, vulnerability, shame, and empathy. I use her research and books in my recovery a lot, so get used to hearing about her. 

Any who, my defining moment while reading “The Gifts of Imperfection” was her discussion on the word courage and how it interacts with shame. She said: 

“The word courage comes from the latin word *cor* which means “to speak one's mind, by telling all one's heart…\[s\]hame hates it when we reach out and tell our story. It hates having words wrapped around it - it can’t survive being shared. Shame loves secrecy. When we bury our story, the shame metastasizes.” Brené Brown, The Gifts of Imperfection 

I had sooooooo much shame about my abusive marriage. I felt like I should have known better. I felt like I did know better. I felt like I did it to myself. I was afraid to tell people I was divorced for fear of the question “why?” I felt like I deserved him and the abuse if I was stupid enough to fall for his lies and charm and not leave sooner. Then, reading this part of the book, I snapped out of it. Everything my family and friends had been begging me to see. Begging me to lay down the mantle of continuing the verbal abuse on myself. I changed my narrative, and my mantra become:

“My story is one of love, trauma and abuse. The last 10 years of my life are painted with it. I am going to be honest about my story. I am going to tell my story. I refuse to feel shame for my story. I refuse to hold shame for something someone else CHOSE to do to me.” 

With this, I stopped holding back my truth, my story. If someone asked me why I was divorced, I told them, just as comfortably as if they asked me where I grew up. Shame still crept in from time to time, but in those moments I just repeated to myself, “I REFUSE TO HOLD SHAME FOR SOMETHING SOMEONE ELSE **CHOSE** TO DO TO ME!” 

So, here I have written a new chapter of my story. One I am not too proud of but is important to share, especially with other victims/survivors.

But first, some facts:

According to[ The National Domestic Violence Hotline](https://www.thehotline.org/resources/statistics/) and[ STAND! For Families Free of Violence](https://www.standffov.org/why-dont-they-leave):

* On average a victim attempts to leave 7 times before finally leaving for good.
* The most lethal time in an abusive relationship is after a victim leaves. More than 70% of domestic violence murders happen after the victim has gotten out. 
* Abusers often threaten suicide when a victim leaves. 
* Abusers often threaten to follow or harm victims or family members if they leave. 
* When a person lives in unending terror/stress, their ability to resist gets worn away. They become confused, exhausted, and lack the energy to make changes. 

Even though I consider my “Freedom Date” to be May 20th, 2015, I didn’t finally leave my ex-husband until June 15, 2015. May 20th signifies the day my mind and awareness of what was happening shifted. That was the day my willingness to do ANYTHING to not live a life in abuse was born. However, that being said, after I left on May 20, 2015, I went back a week later filled with promises of sobriety, therapy and change. Leaving did what I wanted it to do. It appeared to scare the shit out of him and showed him that I wasn’t afraid to go if he didn’t make changes. We had a great few weeks together. We talked a lot. He understood my apprehension and worked to re-build my trust. We went for drives around the mountains, and hikes we had never done. We gardened and worked on our house. We both knew, it seemed, that this was our last chance to recover and save our marriage. 

After three weeks of being recluse we had a weekend of plans scheduled with my family. Dinner and an outdoor concert with my folks, a birthday party for a good family friend, and an early Father's Day celebration for my Dad and Brother. 

The dinner with my parents was a little rough. He claimed I hadn’t told him about the weekend plans with my family, when in fact we had had significant conversations about every detail. He was mad, quiet, and difficult. The evening ended and we went home. The minute we walked into the house, he changed. I sat on the couch with our dog and he walked into the bedroom, glared at me, and then slammed the door. I wasn’t having it. I didn’t get why he was so upset, but it was his shit to deal with, not mine. So I stayed in the living room for a few hours until I knew he was asleep. When I thought it was safe, I went to bed, slithered my way onto my side and laid there, as quiet as I could be. Just when I was about to doze off, he got up, turned on the lights and told me how worthless I was. The fighting began. Four hours of verbal abuse. He told me I was ugly, horrible in bed, and had no purpose for him except to have his kids. He said he never actually loved me, he just wanted me to give him children. These are the statements I remember from that night, but there were a lot more. At one point he left, said he was going to the liquor store. When he left I looked at everything in my closet and started to wonder how quickly I could pack. I sat on the bed, laid with my dog, knowing if I chose to leave for good I would have to leave him too. I sobbed. I had no idea what was going to happen but I knew our little family was breaking up and I had to let go of my house, my dog, any possession I couldn’t fit into my car, and the life I had in the town I loved. I looked at myself in the mirror and saw that I wasn’t “living” my life, I was surviving it. Then I heard the screen door slam. He was home. It was too late to leave. The verbal abuse continued until he finally went to sleep. 

That night showed me that he wasn’t abusive because he was an alcoholic. He was abusive because he was abusive. Abuse is not a symptom of alcoholism. Abuse is a choice. I had no idea what to do, but I knew not to do anything drastic, for fear of my safety. So I decided to make it through the weekend with family and then leave on Monday. After work, I would not come home. 

We made it through Saturday. I told him all of the mean things he said the night before. This time he could not say he didn’t remember. I told him how indescribably hurt I was and that I didn’t know what to do. We went to the birthday party that night and made it through without being discovered. 

The next morning, on Sunday, he didn’t understand why I was being cold towards him. He wanted me to get over it already. He thought I was being dramatic. He thought the fact that I was holding onto what he said, and not forgiving him, was what was making our marriage difficult. Not his actions, his words, his behavior for the last 5 years. I lost it. I told him he wasn’t welcome to my parents house and to drop me off. 

When I arrived, I told my family we weren’t doing well and I wasn’t sure if we were going to make it. At one point that day he barged in and my family had to kick him out. I told my Mom that I wanted him to hurt like he made me hurt. Obviously this got her attention. We agreed I would get some things and come stay with them for a while until I figured out what was next. Marriage counseling? Divorce? I was in shock with grief and frozen from trauma. You know fight, flight or freeze… I was exhausted and I was frozen. My Mom took me home so I could pack my car and leave, again. He wasn’t home and neither was our dog, which meant he was out drinking somewhere. I quickly threw my clothes and special belongings in my car. With the engine turned on I was about to leave, but couldn’t. I called his Mom and talked to her instead. She understood where I was coming from, but being divorced herself, reminded me of the finality of the action I was about to take. I went back inside and turned on the TV. I decided I was going to wait for him so we could talk, again. An hour passed by and my Mom texted me to see how I was doing. I told her I was packed but waiting to talk to him. My Mom has never been one to tell me what to do, even as a child, she guided me but never “ordered” me. She texted me back and said, “get in your car and come home.” I was surprised by how direct she was, and trusting her, I left.

I didn’t sleep that night. In the past when I tried to leave he did a number of things to retaliate. Harassed me, became violent at the place or with the people who were helping me, threatened to commit suicide. I was at my family's house, with my parents, brother, pregnant sister-in-law and my 4 year old nephew. I was terrified of bringing them into the violence I had lived. So, I laid in my bed, with the windows open so I could hear his truck, and I waited. He drove by a few times, but didn’t do anything.  

The next morning he called me first thing and told me to come home. When I told him I wasn’t going to, he said he was on his way to the courthouse to file for divorce. I kept quiet and asked him to give me time. He kept saying it, and reminding me how worthless I was without him. Classic manipulation in hopes of making me beg him not to leave me. I did not fall for it. Over the next few weeks we went to two counseling sessions, but the more time I spent away from him, the more I noticed how terrified of him I was. 

At the beginning of July I learned he had been lying to me about drinking. That, FINALLY, was enough. I finally got it that he didn’t get it. I filed for divorce and told my family and friends about the abuse. I let go. All of the pieces I had been trying to hold together. All the lies I was trying to hide. All of the bruises and scars I had been hiding. I let go of it all at once. 

I often hear from other victims/survivors I am working with how ashamed they are for having a hard time leaving, staying away, and recovering from abuse. After emotional, verbal and psychological abuse, it’s easy to get down on ourselves for not being “better” at escaping. The negative self talk about anything and everything is a symptom of the abuse, and quite often is torturous enough to make us return. We are also exhausted from years of surviving. It’s hard to know whats up from down. I attempted to leave seven times before I succeeded. It’s hard, but it’s possible. What I am hoping can be taken from this post is: 

Leaving abuse is not easy, its fucking hard, but it is possible. 

There is no perfect way to do it.

Leaving abuse is messy. 

If leaving takes multiple attempts, it is not a reflection of your ability, resilience, or strength. It is a normal part of the process. 

It takes time and help, but eventually, the pain, grief and trauma will dissipate. I promise. There is life after domestic violence. 

Per usual, I have to say, if you are ready to leave an abusive relationship I STRONGLY encourage you to talk to a trained advocate at a[ local shelter](https://www.domesticshelters.org/help#?page=1) or the[ National Domestic Violence Hotline](https://www.thehotline.org/).

I know the right thing to do but I haven’t done it. What is wrong with me? I’m a strong woman with an amazing career who supports my whole family. He doesn’t really work.

I’m sorry for the ramble but I’m so confused and afraid and anxious and have no one to talk to expect his sister and mom who are understanding and supportive but in the end he is their family and they love him. If I tell my parents it will just spin all out of control. We separated in 2018 and my parents were supportive but if they know that he touched me again it will be so hard on them and my dad is sick with cancer and I don’t want to add that stress to them.

I stayed silent about a lot of the abuse from the past, but am finally seeking advice on how to really recover and live my life.

While I was with my ex partner I had my medication thrown away and ended up hospitalized as a result. She refused to look into anything and during that time I was essentially told I had to keep a promise of going cold turkey (...from benzodiazepines, that can actually kill you from going cold turkey).

During that time she also physically abused me, I was punched a fair few times. I was made to feel like I had always done something wrong. She has also punched me in public.

She destroyed old gifts we had, stuff like that. One time prior to all of this she tried pulling my clothes off me in public.

My health declined from being withdrawn from medication, and I become more withdrawn and couldn't leave my house much. One night she admitted that she had 'accidently' slept with my friend , because it seemed like I no longer cared and that she did it to punish me.

For some dumb reason I still thought we could salvage things, and we stayed together for another 3 months.

After which we split up. I asked her to go her own way.

She refused to go her own way and refused to find her own friends.

I still feel like I can't visit certain places or speak to certain friends. It's been almost 2 years now but we're unable to even have a civil conversation. 

What should I do? Any advice on recovering? Is it too late for me to consider an injunction or something like that, to make sure she can't abuse me if I visit old friends or old places?",domesticviolence,Advice on what to do after being abused,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/hau0xh/advice_on_what_to_do_after_being_abused/,True

I live separately from them in my grandma's house with her friend (he take care of her). I'm writing this at 2am while crying, so it might lack detail/not correct wording - ask questions if you need.

After they got married, they had a baby daughter. Before she was born, I remember my mum coming home early in the morning after being out all night. I was staying up for her, and when she came home she was crying. It got a lot of asking, but she told me that he punched her in the stomach (she was 2 months into the pregnancy).

After that incident, something else happened. I'm not sure clearly about what did, but she had accidently cut him after he tried to grab a knife from her in the kitchen (he was drunk) which resulted in him having a big cut on his finger. He called the police, and before they came, he began throwing death threats at me (I was in the living room and he was at the door of it yelling at mr). He told me that if I didn't get out of the house when he returned (from the hospital), that he would kill me and my whole family. This might have happened after the police came, but I'm not sure. He also yelled at me, calling me things like bitch, slut, etc. My grandma came to pick me up. He never apologised, but my mum forgave him.

Nothing really happened for the two years, apart from him continually yelling things at my mum like bitch, slut, saying she was useless, telling her not to do certain things, etc. I also remember him threatening to kick my mum out of the house, when they lived in their old house. He would always hit me, jab me with his hand in a way, but play it off as a joke.

Something else happened last month though. Me, my mum, and my little sister (around 1 year and 3 months old) had went out and we came back to their new house. The house is one floor, it was a living room, bathroom, kitchen, and bedroom. When he came home, he began drinking. Me and my mum went to the bedroom, to put my little sister to sleep, while he was in the living room. My little sister was crying a lot, but we still tried to put her to sleep. She's quite stubborn, lol. I took her from my mum, and had her on my upper body, trying to make her sleep. He came into the bedroom, and tried to take her away from me. I said that it was okay and that I can get her to sleep, but he still tried to take her away from me. At first he was just trying to take her, but then he began to grab my hands really hard and sort of jab them (like he was trying to dig his nails into my hands, but with his fingers?) but I kept persistenting. He became more violent in doing it, until he took his hand and put it around my neck, really hard, and began squeezing it until I could barely breathe and felt my vision going away a bit. I called the police. While I was on the phone with them, I was in the kitchen and he was in the living room (they're opposite from the house), he kept yelling at me saying he was going to kill me by cutting/stabbing me, he kept calling me things like bitch, slut, he kept saying that he didnt want a disabled person in the house (I'm blind in one eye), he kept saying to me to leave and that this would be the last time I would be in the house. When the police came after 10 minutes, I explained what happen and told them about the incident of where he threatened me. They asked questions on his previous behaviour, and I told them. They said that the only thing they could do is take me home.

After the incident, I kept having suicidal thoughts. I also had thoughts that he was going to come to me and kill me, like he would find me in the street and bash my head against the pavement, or how he was going to come to my house and kill me. As it's my birthday in a month, my mum told me she was going to come to my house with him and my sister to give me cake. I told her I didnt want him to come, and she asked me why. I told her how he made me feel, about the thoughts I had. She told me to think about how hard it was for her to bring the cake while with my little sister. I told her I also self harm because of it, and she told me I did it before what he did (this is true, but I also did it after/as result of what he did). She doesnt try to help me, and she keeps on defending him by saying he was angry, or how he has problems with his job, etc (this is also the same for when he threaten me the first time). She told me she would help me, and that she loved me more than him. My grandma bashes me for it, after what happen I didnt leave me room for a week/eat and she keeps saying about how it affected her. Because my mum bring my sister for us to take care of her when she work, he has to come and pick her up after 4PM. I leave to go upstairs so I dont have to see him, and my grandma said ""you're leaving like someone will hurt you"" (I'm not sure how to translate it).

My mum says she cant leave him because she doesn't want to live in my grandmas house ""under control"", and how she wont have money if she leaves (she has job, but I dont think it give much money)

I met with a lawyer. I’m still in the planning stages of filing for divorce. I hope a position opens up near my parents several hours away so I can transfer near them with my employer. But with COVID and ability to work from home, I may not need to do that even.

I don’t want to have my husband served while at work.  The lawyer said I can just tell him that I’m filing and my lawyer just needs to know where to serve him and then suggest he obtain a lawyer and the lawyer can serve him divorce papers through his lawyer. 

We have child so it will need to go through mediation and requires 90 day waiting period so I don’t want to wait too much  longer. It would be easier if the children were back in school to have this conversation with him. But with COVID, I’m also scared to have this conversation with him while home alone.  So at this rate, I probably won’t file until end of August.

Sometimes I think I am lucky, God gifted me with poor sight. Once the glasses get knocked off it's all a blur ... literally.

The difficulty lies in dealing with the aftermath, helplessly running fingers across the wooden floor; porcelain, crystal glass and dirt those are my finds that day. Then something cold comes into touch, round and wired it sits lifeless, waiting for me patiently. I pull myself forward and place the cool wiring against my burning cheeks - the world comes into focus.

This is my life story.

I am 30 year old female living in india. I got married At 22. It was an arrange marriage. After marriage I started noticing that my husband gets angry very quickly for small things like why snacks are not ready when he reaches home from office. Why there there is less salt in food. As I got married straight out the college I dint know cooking at all. I was learning to cook after marriage. But I adjusted to all that and learned to cook soon. Bit he still would complain that I don't cook like his mom. I should learn from his mother.  When he gets angry and shouts at me his language becomes very bad and will abuse me verbally. 

I had told all this to my mother, she told me its OK its alright, just don't make him angry. Behave nicely with him do everything for him. Keep him happy. 

After 1 year of marriage his mother started asking for kids. Before getting married he had suggested that we will wait for 3 years after marriage I had also agreed to it as I dint wanted to have kids immediately.
But when his mother started asking him, he started to force me for it. As I was taking contraceptive pills. He forced me to stop taking those. But I asked him to give me some time, give me 3 months I will get my health in good condition as i was anemic, so that in 3 months i can improve my haemoglobin level and then try for pregnancy. He dint agree for it and forced me to have sex without my consent. I was crying all the time and he started to shout at me saying what are u crying for, you are crying as if I raped you. 

After a month I got pregnant. But that pregnancy resulted in miscarriage.
Once the miscarriage happened his mother blamed me stating that as I was taking contraceptive pills, I got miscarriage and I am not fit to bear children. He also agreed to it and that resulted in big fight. My parents also got involved, his parents also got involved. The fight was big. He had clearly told that you cannot come back until your parents apologize to my parents, as your parents have spoken a lot about me.
I tried to make him understand as we have married we should try to work on the relationship if parents are having a fight let them have there fights should not affect our relationship.
In spite of him saying don't come. I went to stay with him, after I went thats when the physical abuse started. The first time he hit me I told my mom about it she said is ok it happened only once, it won't happen again. Then I got pregnant.  But the verbal abuse was still present. Once my daughter was born. Physically hitting me, shouting at me, forcing me to have sex. Even if I say no he would force me to do it. While I am sleeping he would come and remove my pants and do sex with me. When I question him for such kind of behavior he says he does it for relaxation purpose. All this continued. When my daughter was 5 years he hit me a lot. Thats when I took my daughter and went to parents place. Told my parents that i am not going back to that house and i want a divorce. But my parents never believed me they say that I should adjust and live there. They thought I was depressed and they took me for counselling so that I do not talk about divorce and go back there. My parents also physically hit me, and they sent my daughter to husband's house. When I question my parents they say that I do not deserve to a mother. They say that in every marriage there is violence you should learn to adjust for your daughter. My parents took away my money and then they forced me to go back to that house. I told them clearly that I will not live in that house I will go away some where else. But they said we don't care what you do but you should go back to that house.
they sent me back. I lived at my husband house for 1 month then I left the house. Sent an email to police and to husband stating that I am leaving the house. I took up a job in another city and I am living in a hostel now.

Now I am preparing for divorce and custody of my daughter.
 But at times I feel guilty that I left my daughter in that house.

This is an almost an exclusively white neighborhood.  When we met he spoke about how there were racists in his last apartment complex and I assured him that my girlfriend and I and the other tenant were not racist.

About two weeks after he moved in, we heard him and girlfriend yelling at each other.  Sometimes it was during the day, sometimes it would be in the middle of the night.  We never said anything because we didn't know how to address it.  We told the landlord a few times about it and we don't know how he addressed it but he said he did.

Eventually we could hear things getting physical.  It sounded like there was a knock down drag out fight happening next door.  We called the cops.  When the cops came the couple had left the apartment to go for a walk and the cops couldn't really do anything.  As a white person, I was very hesitant to call the cops on a black man.  As far as I know he doesn't know we have called the cops.

There has been little noise coming from their apartment but we hear some things now and again.  When the girlfriend isn't wearing long sleeve shirts you can see the bruises on her arms.

Today I heard his girlfriend yell, ""stop, you're hurting me!""  We called the landlord and our landlord called him.  We could hear our neighbor yelling at the landlord that he was afraid for his life and that she is having medicine issues and it makes her scream.  He feels like everyone hates him and that we're playing around with his life.  Our landlord said he spoke with the girlfriend and she said she wasn't being abused.  Which I do not think that any victim would say they were being abused while the accused is in the same room.

We do not know how to resolve this issue.  We want to talk to them but they seem to not be admitting what's going on.  I could be wrong I suppose, maybe she's has an issue that makes her yell and scream in the middle of the night when no one is abusing her.   I don't want to call the cops on a black man where things could escalate and he could be killed.  I don't want to do nothing and let either one of them hurt the other one.  Its causing us real emotional distress having to listen to it.  It doesn't seem like it's a good idea to confront your neighbors about how one of them is being abused or how they might be abusing each other.

I have lived in an abusive relationship for about 5 years now and finally got rid of him in a few months ago. It went far (as usual with this guy) and he got a restraining order, after I called the cops on him ( I really had to, he was drunk and was chasing me in my own apt). 

But this was not the first time. It has happened 7 or 8 times before that he has gone violent on me to the point that I had to call the police. I know l, I've been stupid to take him back but trust me, ge is a master manipulator and said all the right things when he was ""sorry"". 

He used to get drunk or high and made me break up with him since he was a coward and couldn't do it. I hope you get the picture here. All of this has been very painful to me, bc I really loved him. I have now, since the last time he fucked up, decided to never take him back again and kept my promise. 

He hasn't contacted me, but i know that is only bc there is a restraining order on him. I'm sure he'll reach out one way or another and do as usual, beg me to come back for he has changed an so on. 

I now understand that he never loved me and only wanted to owe me and use my energy so I promised myself to not give him another second of my life.

Then came the call. Today, the day after my birthday and it was my lawyer, telling me that the cops want to speak to me one last time and then they have enough to prosecute him and it will go to court. The probability of him getting a jail sentence is high. 

Now comes the dilemma. I want to leave this behind. I'm happy I have the restraining order so he won't come near for another 4 months at least , but I am so so afraid. If I do proceed with this, it will take more of my time and energy that I really don't want to put in this bs anymore, cuz I'm so tired of this drama, but if I don't do it he probably won't leave me alone.

Wtf should I do. I study at uni and really want to focus on that. That's really all I want to do. I just want him to leave me alone.",domesticviolence,"Damned if I do, damned if I don't..",https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/ha5ken/damned_if_i_do_damned_if_i_dont/,True

I have been with my bf for four and a half years, at least two and a half of those have been abusive.  Things really stepped up at the start of the year and with the lockdown the levels of emotional abuse, sexual coercion and the fear of angry moods and threats to sleep with other people have been unbearable.  Things reached a fever pitch a couple of weeks ago after I was coerced into a threesome I had categorically said I did not want to do, after being plied with alcohol and drugs.  I have been really struggling since then.

I asked him to leave last Monday after he told me he wanted to sleep with men.  And then I begged him to leave on Tuesday.  He keeps saying that we are a union and will work it out.  He pretended that everything was fine the next two days, telling me over and over how he couldn't wait to spend Friday night with me and to have sex.  Friday night comes around and he smokes a huge amount of weed and ignores me all night, texting and not replying when I talk to him.  It gets to nearly 11pm and I look over at him as he's still texting.  He gets very cross and accused me of giving him dirty looks and asks why.  I explained that I was really upset that he had ignored me all night and broken his work to me yet again, despite promising me that he wanted to fix that.  He made some excuse about it being the lockdown and how the world was different and then told me that I should be happy anyway as he was texting about setting up sleeping with a guy.  I lost it.  I shouted and cried, I told him how if spent hours getting ready, cleaning up, looking nice etc and he looked me up at down in disgust and laughed in my face.  He shoved me across the kitchen at some point and the. Said something I really can't remember and I flew at him, kicked his legs and told him I would like to slit his throat.  It was wrong, I should have kept my temper but I needed him to see just how much pain he has caused me.

Of course he flees the house, runs to his friends, tells them all I'm an alcoholic and he's suffering from domestic violence.  He's had me referred to mental health professionals and I've ended up being passed on for an alcohol dependency intervention.  I've explained to every professional what is happening and they are all very understanding but I'm just in turmoil.  I really don't know what to do.  I just want to believe that he hasn't done any of this on purpose.  I've just spoken to him again about the way he treats me and it doesn't matter what I say, or what I show he finds a way to say it's somehow my fault.  I feel really broken.  I'm in the UK if that helps anyone with any advice.

Is this kind of sharing platform something that you would even support or is it detrimental in other ways?

If you are not familiar with Brené Brown, she is a research professor at the University of Houston and has spent the past two decades studying courage, vulnerability, shame, and empathy. I use her research and books in my recovery a lot, so get used to hearing about her. 

Any who, my defining moment while reading “The Gifts of Imperfection” was her discussion on the word courage and how it interacts with shame. She said: 

“The word courage comes from the latin word *cor* which means “to speak one's mind, by telling all one's heart…\[s\]hame hates it when we reach out and tell our story. It hates having words wrapped around it - it can’t survive being shared. Shame loves secrecy. When we bury our story, the shame metastasizes.” Brené Brown, The Gifts of Imperfection 

I had sooooooo much shame about my abusive marriage. I felt like I should have known better. I felt like I did know better. I felt like I did it to myself. I was afraid to tell people I was divorced for fear of the question “why?” I felt like I deserved him and the abuse if I was stupid enough to fall for his lies and charm and not leave sooner. Then, reading this part of the book, I snapped out of it. Everything my family and friends had been begging me to see. Begging me to lay down the mantle of continuing the verbal abuse on myself. I changed my narrative, and my mantra become:

“My story is one of love, trauma and abuse. The last 10 years of my life are painted with it. I am going to be honest about my story. I am going to tell my story. I refuse to feel shame for my story. I refuse to hold shame for something someone else CHOSE to do to me.” 

With this, I stopped holding back my truth, my story. If someone asked me why I was divorced, I told them, just as comfortably as if they asked me where I grew up. Shame still crept in from time to time, but in those moments I just repeated to myself, “I REFUSE TO HOLD SHAME FOR SOMETHING SOMEONE ELSE **CHOSE** TO DO TO ME!” 

So, here I have written a new chapter of my story. One I am not too proud of but is important to share, especially with other victims/survivors.

But first, some facts:

According to[ The National Domestic Violence Hotline](https://www.thehotline.org/resources/statistics/) and[ STAND! For Families Free of Violence](https://www.standffov.org/why-dont-they-leave):

* On average a victim attempts to leave 7 times before finally leaving for good.
* The most lethal time in an abusive relationship is after a victim leaves. More than 70% of domestic violence murders happen after the victim has gotten out. 
* Abusers often threaten suicide when a victim leaves. 
* Abusers often threaten to follow or harm victims or family members if they leave. 
* When a person lives in unending terror/stress, their ability to resist gets worn away. They become confused, exhausted, and lack the energy to make changes. 

Even though I consider my “Freedom Date” to be May 20th, 2015, I didn’t finally leave my ex-husband until June 15, 2015. May 20th signifies the day my mind and awareness of what was happening shifted. That was the day my willingness to do ANYTHING to not live a life in abuse was born. However, that being said, after I left on May 20, 2015, I went back a week later filled with promises of sobriety, therapy and change. Leaving did what I wanted it to do. It appeared to scare the shit out of him and showed him that I wasn’t afraid to go if he didn’t make changes. We had a great few weeks together. We talked a lot. He understood my apprehension and worked to re-build my trust. We went for drives around the mountains, and hikes we had never done. We gardened and worked on our house. We both knew, it seemed, that this was our last chance to recover and save our marriage. 

After three weeks of being recluse we had a weekend of plans scheduled with my family. Dinner and an outdoor concert with my folks, a birthday party for a good family friend, and an early Father's Day celebration for my Dad and Brother. 

The dinner with my parents was a little rough. He claimed I hadn’t told him about the weekend plans with my family, when in fact we had had significant conversations about every detail. He was mad, quiet, and difficult. The evening ended and we went home. The minute we walked into the house, he changed. I sat on the couch with our dog and he walked into the bedroom, glared at me, and then slammed the door. I wasn’t having it. I didn’t get why he was so upset, but it was his shit to deal with, not mine. So I stayed in the living room for a few hours until I knew he was asleep. When I thought it was safe, I went to bed, slithered my way onto my side and laid there, as quiet as I could be. Just when I was about to doze off, he got up, turned on the lights and told me how worthless I was. The fighting began. Four hours of verbal abuse. He told me I was ugly, horrible in bed, and had no purpose for him except to have his kids. He said he never actually loved me, he just wanted me to give him children. These are the statements I remember from that night, but there were a lot more. At one point he left, said he was going to the liquor store. When he left I looked at everything in my closet and started to wonder how quickly I could pack. I sat on the bed, laid with my dog, knowing if I chose to leave for good I would have to leave him too. I sobbed. I had no idea what was going to happen but I knew our little family was breaking up and I had to let go of my house, my dog, any possession I couldn’t fit into my car, and the life I had in the town I loved. I looked at myself in the mirror and saw that I wasn’t “living” my life, I was surviving it. Then I heard the screen door slam. He was home. It was too late to leave. The verbal abuse continued until he finally went to sleep. 

That night showed me that he wasn’t abusive because he was an alcoholic. He was abusive because he was abusive. Abuse is not a symptom of alcoholism. Abuse is a choice. I had no idea what to do, but I knew not to do anything drastic, for fear of my safety. So I decided to make it through the weekend with family and then leave on Monday. After work, I would not come home. 

We made it through Saturday. I told him all of the mean things he said the night before. This time he could not say he didn’t remember. I told him how indescribably hurt I was and that I didn’t know what to do. We went to the birthday party that night and made it through without being discovered. 

The next morning, on Sunday, he didn’t understand why I was being cold towards him. He wanted me to get over it already. He thought I was being dramatic. He thought the fact that I was holding onto what he said, and not forgiving him, was what was making our marriage difficult. Not his actions, his words, his behavior for the last 5 years. I lost it. I told him he wasn’t welcome to my parents house and to drop me off. 

When I arrived, I told my family we weren’t doing well and I wasn’t sure if we were going to make it. At one point that day he barged in and my family had to kick him out. I told my Mom that I wanted him to hurt like he made me hurt. Obviously this got her attention. We agreed I would get some things and come stay with them for a while until I figured out what was next. Marriage counseling? Divorce? I was in shock with grief and frozen from trauma. You know fight, flight or freeze… I was exhausted and I was frozen. My Mom took me home so I could pack my car and leave, again. He wasn’t home and neither was our dog, which meant he was out drinking somewhere. I quickly threw my clothes and special belongings in my car. With the engine turned on I was about to leave, but couldn’t. I called his Mom and talked to her instead. She understood where I was coming from, but being divorced herself, reminded me of the finality of the action I was about to take. I went back inside and turned on the TV. I decided I was going to wait for him so we could talk, again. An hour passed by and my Mom texted me to see how I was doing. I told her I was packed but waiting to talk to him. My Mom has never been one to tell me what to do, even as a child, she guided me but never “ordered” me. She texted me back and said, “get in your car and come home.” I was surprised by how direct she was, and trusting her, I left.

I didn’t sleep that night. In the past when I tried to leave he did a number of things to retaliate. Harassed me, became violent at the place or with the people who were helping me, threatened to commit suicide. I was at my family's house, with my parents, brother, pregnant sister-in-law and my 4 year old nephew. I was terrified of bringing them into the violence I had lived. So, I laid in my bed, with the windows open so I could hear his truck, and I waited. He drove by a few times, but didn’t do anything.  

The next morning he called me first thing and told me to come home. When I told him I wasn’t going to, he said he was on his way to the courthouse to file for divorce. I kept quiet and asked him to give me time. He kept saying it, and reminding me how worthless I was without him. Classic manipulation in hopes of making me beg him not to leave me. I did not fall for it. Over the next few weeks we went to two counseling sessions, but the more time I spent away from him, the more I noticed how terrified of him I was. 

At the beginning of July I learned he had been lying to me about drinking. That, FINALLY, was enough. I finally got it that he didn’t get it. I filed for divorce and told my family and friends about the abuse. I let go. All of the pieces I had been trying to hold together. All the lies I was trying to hide. All of the bruises and scars I had been hiding. I let go of it all at once. 

I often hear from other victims/survivors I am working with how ashamed they are for having a hard time leaving, staying away, and recovering from abuse. After emotional, verbal and psychological abuse, it’s easy to get down on ourselves for not being “better” at escaping. The negative self talk about anything and everything is a symptom of the abuse, and quite often is torturous enough to make us return. We are also exhausted from years of surviving. It’s hard to know whats up from down. I attempted to leave seven times before I succeeded. It’s hard, but it’s possible. What I am hoping can be taken from this post is: 

Leaving abuse is not easy, its fucking hard, but it is possible. 

There is no perfect way to do it.

Leaving abuse is messy. 

If leaving takes multiple attempts, it is not a reflection of your ability, resilience, or strength. It is a normal part of the process. 

It takes time and help, but eventually, the pain, grief and trauma will dissipate. I promise. There is life after domestic violence. 

Per usual, I have to say, if you are ready to leave an abusive relationship I STRONGLY encourage you to talk to a trained advocate at a[ local shelter](https://www.domesticshelters.org/help#?page=1) or the[ National Domestic Violence Hotline](https://www.thehotline.org/). A trained advocate is able to help you navigate your personal experiences, resources and obstacles and help you develop the best and safest plan of action.",domesticviolence,Leaving for the Seventh Time,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/hate94/leaving_for_the_seventh_time/,True

I stayed silent about a lot of the abuse from the past, but am finally seeking advice on how to really recover and live my life.

While I was with my ex partner I had my medication thrown away and ended up hospitalized as a result. She refused to look into anything and during that time I was essentially told I had to keep a promise of going cold turkey (...from benzodiazepines, that can actually kill you from going cold turkey).

During that time she also physically abused me, I was punched a fair few times. I was made to feel like I had always done something wrong. She has also punched me in public.

She destroyed old gifts we had, stuff like that. One time prior to all of this she tried pulling my clothes off me in public.

My health declined from being withdrawn from medication, and I become more withdrawn and couldn't leave my house much. One night she admitted that she had 'accidently' slept with my friend , because it seemed like I no longer cared and that she did it to punish me.

For some dumb reason I still thought we could salvage things, and we stayed together for another 3 months.

After which we split up. I asked her to go her own way.

She refused to go her own way and refused to find her own friends.

I still feel like I can't visit certain places or speak to certain friends. It's been almost 2 years now but we're unable to even have a civil conversation. 

What should I do? Any advice on recovering? Is it too late for me to consider an injunction or something like that, to make sure she can't abuse me if I visit old friends or old places?",domesticviolence,Advice on what to do after being abused,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/hau0xh/advice_on_what_to_do_after_being_abused/,True

This is my first time posting in this sub, the mods from r/relationships sent me to you guys. Please forgive any irregularities. 

I recently moved back in with my parents. They fight. A lot. Nasty, screaming-match fights that can last for days. They had a child last year which has naturally created new tensions in the house, mostly because my stepfather contributes substantially less to childcare than my mother. It's obvious he loves the baby, but he often leaves my mother to do 70–90% of the grunt work (e.g. napping while she's in tears from back pain and needs help with the baby, spending hours at the gym/not adjusting any part of his pre-baby schedule, etc.) They are both currently unemployed and basically in the house together 24/7. To be honest it's clear that he's not equally contributing and it's grinding her down, but they don't communicate well at all and the whole situation is generating a lot of resentment. He is currently doing CBT therapy for anger management, which was a stipulation of an ultimatum my mother apparently gave him to avoid divorce. Couples therapy is not currently an option for insurance reasons.

A few months ago he purchased a rifle for home defense. I believe it's an AR-15. It is not in a safe. It stays beside their bed in the case it was purchased in. The other week, they got into an argument that ended with my stepdad storming out of the house. My mom broke down in front of me and admitted that he recently said to her ""I should shoot you in the fucking head"" while they were having a fight. Guys, I don't have the words to describe what hearing that felt like. It was a sickening, primal fear. My face must have given me away because she instantly regretted telling me, and spent the next half hour reassuring me that she felt completely safe and knew for a fact that he would never harm her. But what mother wouldn't?

My stepdad has never struck me as the violent type. He's a bit more confrontational than my mother and I, but I've always attributed that to his hailing from a more urban, crowded part of the country than us. I have always felt completely and totally safe around him. He has been in my life since I was a teenager, and I've come to view him as my true father, which only makes this worse. I feel guilty for the fears that I'm having. He has done so much for me, and has supported me in so many ways, and here I am, scared that he might harm my mom or my sibling or all of us. I will say that he is ex-military (non-combat) and ex-NFL, and we have suspected for some time that he may suffer from CTE.

I am physically ill with paranoia. They have been screaming most of the day, and with every lull in the argument I'm terrified that I will hear gunshots. I know this is very macabre, and it might just be my anxiety rearing its ugly head, but my quality of life has dropped significantly since this began. I don't have a big biological family. My mother and sibling are all I have, and if something were to happen to them, my life would be over. I just don't know what to do. My mom is financially dependent on him, and she does not have a degree. If I were to do anything that would remove either of them from this house, she and the baby (and myself) would be homeless and without any money. And although I feel horribly selfish even thinking about my own situation, this is really taxing me emotionally. I'm trying to get through college while also working part-time, and now I have this nightmarish anxiety always waiting for me at home. On top of that, I'm often left to care for the baby in a separate room while they fight. I can't do it all. It's eating me up.

My longterm boyfriend (24M) who, admittedly, is much more level-headed and much less anxious than I am, is trying to reassure me that my stepdad wouldn't hurt my mother. He thinks it was purely a heat of the moment anger that spilled out, and perhaps a result of my stepdad's military/police training. And really, I have never once felt unsafe around my stepfather until this happened. But I'm trying to look at the facts here, which are:

* There is a gun in the house that is in plain sight at all times, not in a safe.
* They are having bitter, drawn out fights every other week or so, often within the same space as the weapon.
* They are constantly in close proximity with little reprieve from one another.
* He has impulsively threatened to shoot her.
* It is possible that he has suffered brain injuries that can impact decision-making.
* Also a fact is that the best predictor of future behavior is past behavior, and my stepdad has never laid a hand on my mother (that I know of.)

What do I do? What *can* I do? What *should* I do? Am I overreacting? Any advice will be appreciated so much. 

TLDR; My stepdad threatened to shoot my mother in the head during a recent argument. He owns a gun which he doesn't keep locked up. They are having intense arguments several times a month, primarily surrounding tensions caused by my new baby sibling. He has never hurt me or my mother, and is by all accounts a kind person, but the paranoia is wearing me down. Neither my mother nor myself are in a position to leave the house, and I don't even know if that's something that should be considered. I am juggling school, work, the fear of my mother being harmed, and the responsibility of caring for my sibling while they fight. I am overwhelmed, scared, and confused.

Last night my boyfriend and father of my child raped me. It was my birthday. My first night out, baby with a sitter, for the first time in over a year. I got intoxicated and a took one single hit of weed. I was unable to walk, I had slurred speech, confusion, and I think I periodically passed out. My boyfriend was pretty much sober, however. 
He brought me to bed and I was laying on my back. At first I thought I was dreaming when I realized he wasn’t listening to me saying “no “ repeatedly. I used my arms to try and push him away. I said I don’t want this, I don’t know who you are, and even cried “rape” over and over. Nothing stopped him. I couldn’t believe he could be capable of this. I remember crying “no, not YOU! Not you not you!” Because I never imagined he was capable of this... 
This morning I woke up and sat up in disbelief. I wanted to believe it was a nightmare. But he woke up to. He seemed irritated and asked if I remember last night. I said I had a bad dream. He said it was real, that I kept crying rape, saying no, that I don’t know him. So there’s no doubt in my mind that this all happened. But I’m shocked that he so readily confessed to it like he doesn’t see a problem ?! He admits I was blacked out, didn’t want sex, cried rape, but he chose to continue anyway. I feel numb, scared, and confused. Just, why? Why would he do this? I feel betrayed, violated, and lost.",domesticviolence,My boyfriend raped me.

I need advice and your opinions/ and any personal experience you might have relating to my situation. I've {female 21 yr} been dating my boyfriend {male 20yrs} for about 2 years, its been up and down definitely toxic at times, but recently as we've both been going to therapy and getting help we have been better than ever. Some background on my boyfriend, his father is very abusive and has been his whole life, he still lives with his parents &amp; his environment at home is usually very toxic. Yesterday I was over at his parents house and we were watching a show in his room, his younger sister {shes 9 years old} came and watched it with us, my boyfriend fell asleep quickly so I let him be and am just enjoying the show with his little sister. As time passes its about 8pm, I decide to wake him up because I know that he won't be able to fall asleep later that night if he keeps napping. Hes probably been asleep for about an hour and a half maybe more, so I gently wake him &amp; hes pretty grumpy and annoyed. I explain to him that I just wanted him to be able to fall asleep later and that it was getting late. He's still half asleep and I let him be for a few mins- i lovingly put my head on his and nudge him a few times (I can see how that would be annoying but its out of love) he then gets very angry and raises his voice telling me to cut it out. I tell him I have to go soon and want to hangout with him before I go and I nudge him again. He rolls over facing me and backhands me in the face, it was hard. Sometimes we play rough but this was uncalled for and it really hurt. When he slapped me obviously his sister heard it and she put her hand on my face and said hes a meanie, but maybe she thought we were just playing around. A few seconds passed by and my boyfriend didn't do or say anything, I was furious like blood boiling angry and hurt. So I get up and go to the restroom worried I would cry in front of his sister. After I get my stuff I say I'm going home, I did not want to be there as it was only past 8pm my boyfriend and his sister are surprised because I usually stay later. I walk out and head to my car. My boyfriend has the audacity to ask why I'm leaving and I'm dumbfounded. I even say are you fucking kidding me you slapped me in the face &amp; you did it in front of your little sister? He says he doesn't REMEMBER slapping me and that it was on accident and points out that nothing like this has ever happened before. I keep my distance and don't say much after he gives his speech saying he's sorry and bs he tries to tell me to come inside. HELL no he asks for a hug and I say no thanks and I get in my car and leave. He has never hit me before, although his slap was hard it didn't cause damage to my face, but I feel so disrespected and that its a huuuuge red flag. He keeps saying he loves me, that he's sorry and that it was an accident. Am I stupid to believe him? Because part of me wants to and then my rational side kicks in and smells the bullshit. Should I leave him? I may have low self-worth but something like this I will not stand for or forgive. They say once your partner hits you most likely they will again and I'm afraid that if I don't leave that it will.

Physically, mentally, emotionally and financially. He’s currently facing 20 years because he tried to kill me. This was just under a year ago (we separated over a year ago) and, while I have come to terms with what happened, the emotional and physical scars still exist. I have been formally diagnosed with ptsd - the effects of which I am still learning to recognize and cope with. 

After I moved to a new city, found a job, my own place, got a dog and became settled I met and became friends with a man through work. After his relationship ended we started dating (it’s been almost 3 months). We were close when we were friends and are even closer now. 

He treats me well, he is kind to me and others, he helps the local community and is hard-working. Even so, I find myself sabotaging our relationship because of my past. I am easily triggered and I find ways to ‘hate’ him. I nit-pick his actions trying to somehow uncover his eventual abuse in some kind of “ta-da, gotcha” type way. 

People always say “trust your gut” but I don’t know what that looks like any more. I’m always second guessing myself to the point that it feels like I’m gaslighting....myself. I don’t trust him when I am triggered nor do I trust myself. I feel like I’m going crazy. 

I name-call (he does not) and yell (he does not). It’s like I have become the abuser because I am so used to having to constantly be on the defense. I don’t want to be this way, feel this way or treat him this way. I don’t want to be the reason our relationship fails. 

He is incredibly supportive and has said he will work to build my trust and to understand my triggers. I feel like such a burden and so pathetic - my need to feel strong and how I try to achieve that is my weakness.

Almost everyone in my family has been abused and has in turn abused. There's other fucked up shit like grandparents being related to each other and a host of medical and mental problems. Our mother abused us when we were younger for no reason, not that abusers ever need a reason to abuse. My goal since I was a child was just to get away from this fucked up family and never look back.

Our father never defended us from our mother, and I will never forgive him for that, but we grew closer over the last few years. At the same time, I don't really know what influenced my brother to become the abuser he is now. Sure, I am also full of rage about my mother's past abuse and how everyone denied it, justified it or made excuses. But it couldn't have just been that.

My brother has flunked school, started drinking and smoking weed, and doesn't try hard enough to not be a NEET. Besides that, about 2 years ago he started assaulting our mother and breaking objects, including stuff he needs. He assaulted our mother during last Christmas lunch in front of my mum's side of the family. He even started to scream at me and insult me for being too 'smart' and 'uppity' in conversations. Everyone thinks he's extremely jealous of me because I'm doing so well despite my circumstances.  Then recently we found out he's been smoking weed for the past few months and does not intend to stop it.

The worst thing is that sometimes I think the assaults are my fault. I try to talk to him as little as possible. But sometimes, it'll go from one of us asking to pass the salt, to my brother insulting me, and then him arguing with one of my parents, and someone assaulted or something broken.

My parents didn't want to go to the police because they didn't want him to have a criminal record. They attempted to make a report once but found a pretty shitty police service (normal in our area), so they didn't do it. At first my parents tried to discipline him. But it only made him more volatile. So then they just tried to help him. He never responded to anything, just kept getting worse and worse. He literally does what he likes and we can't control him.

As of now he's broken: 2 old but useful laptops, 3 new phones, his bathroom mirror, the fruit bowl, our stained glass door, 2 glasses, a jar of peanut butter, a computer, a fan, glass sheets on the furniture, damaged the furniture, a chair, a wifi router and my dad's nose.

The last 7 items all came from one instance yesterday, the worst it's ever been. As usual it started with something simple. Me and him got into an argument, over the weed and everything. Then my parents started to talk to him and took over the conversation. He started screaming and insulting my father, screaming that he's a faggot, pufta. My father just locked himself in the bedroom to get away from it. Then he and my mother argued for a minute before his screaming got out of control. He ran into the corridor, slammed the door almost off its hinges, grabbed the monitor and the chair there and threw them to our side of the corridor. They hit and broke the fan and the glass sheet on the furniture. That's when my father came out and shouted at him to get out. As usual they grappled, my father trying to force him out. My brother ended up punching him hard in the nose and ran out.

He punched him so hard there was blood spatter on the wall and black blood immediately started gushing, streaming out of his nose. There were blood drops on the floor all over the place, especially in the sink where he tried to get himself clean. As we were cleaning and the next day, we still found little droplets on random places like the TV screen. There was so much blood coming out we ended up calling the police for an ambulance. The ambulance never arrived (again, shitty police) so my mother went to take my dad to a clinic herself. 

I stayed home. My brother came to the door about 20 minutes after they left. He's been kicked out countless times and knows to take a very long walk or stay out for a few hours before even attempting to come back in. But lately he'd been trying to bash our door down when he got kicked out. He showed up with such nonchalance after being out for only an hour, and expected to be let back in. My parents told me not to let him in for my own safety and I didn't. I told him what they said, that they were never ever going to let him back in again and that he was a criminal, and I cursed at him to get out of there. He left.

And then I started recording the destruction that had occurred, all the damage and the blood in video. My dad usually records that stuff but I wanted to have my own personal record. It's a good thing I did because he was so shocked that he didn't record anything. The entire time I was so calm, I never shed one tear, if I cry then that's extremely rare for me. And I'm ashamed to say that while half my rage towards my brother was because of my dad's injury, the other half was because he broke the computer where I would play video games. 

At this time it was about 9 at night. I stayed up waiting for my parents, waiting to see if my brother got back, waiting to just see what would happen. I watched some Netflix just because nothing else could effectively distract me enough to pass the time. Then my parents came back at about 11. My dad got a doctor's certificate, certifying that his injury was grievous and that his nose had been broken. They had talked and decided that either my brother was going to co-operate with social workers and counselors or they would prosecute him in court to get him out of the house.

I went to sleep because I was so dead tired. In the morning I found out that my brother had not returned and was effectively missing. We waiting until 1 in the afternoon and were in the process of reporting him missing when he turned up. Apparently he walked to a friend's house and slept there (apparently this kid has parents who literally don't give two shits if their kid is smoking weed in the basement or letting in strangers in the middle of the night). We asked him if he felt any shame in causing them that trouble, and he said no, no surprise. My father's face had swelled up and both his eyes had turned black, my brother showed no empathy, never even said a sorry, just said he didn't mean it to cover his ass.

As of now we're in the process of cleaning up all the damage and throwing some things away, and my parents decided not to reveal when they'll be taking him to social services, but it'll be soon.

My brother is dead to me. DEAD. Any good relationship we might have had he decided to ruin it with his petty jealousy. And I will never forgive him for doing what he did to my father, and distracting me from my studies with his daily arguing and screaming and assaults. In the last 5 years I've never seen him show empathy to anyone, or any responsibility for his duties and actions. He is effectively a parasite in our home who will eventually tear it down piece by piece if we let him live here. And the worst part is our grandparents on both sides who keep coddling him and telling us to treat him kindly even though they know about a lot of the stuff that's happened.",domesticviolence,My brother seriously injured our father and I don't think I coped in a typical way.

She refuses to speak to me ever, so I asked my mom to initiate the conversation with her to see a professional. My mother has spoken to her, and my sister agreed but then they both seemed to forget about it and nothing came of that. 

My mother (53) and my sister are close. My mother is easily manipulated. She's always been a rooter for the underdog and has always had the personality where she wants to help everyone. This is how my sister sucks her in. My mother listens to her sop stories about how life is so hard and her self esteem is just so low; then my mother falls for it. 

Noth my mom and sister have hysterical outbursts sometimes at various people in my family. Often times over silly, small things. If my sister is upset about something my mother acts as her lapdog and begins doing her bidding. They often gang up on myself and my dad. 

My father (60) is a little slow mentally, and old. He was not the best father or husband growing up and my sister harbours a deep hatred for him. She picks fights with him and my mom does her bidding. My sister is extremely controlling. For example, the other day she picked a fight with my dad because he opened to juice bottle on the dinner table before she could open it. 

This is taking its toll on both my mother and father, and possibly my sister too. My mother is developing an addiction to asprin and sleeps for most of the day. She also complains of physical ailments. My father has severe heart disease and is not taking it well either.

I do believe him to be a narcissist, which I definitely think came from the way he was raised.  He has a strong history of abuse, but as he gets older, he's getting a little tamer, and he's running out of options due to  living with his mother and being well over the age of being able to pull the same crap.  That being said, he got a DUI with our daughter and his previous two children earlier this year, and he's still being enabled, but he's also being tested.  He does really well when he stays in support groups and surrounds himself with positive influence rather than his friends that have the same habits of drinking/ruining lives.

Anyway.  Through a course of events, his current girlfriend reached out to me after seeing a post I shared on fb about covid and how it's been hard working at a long-term care facility because we're hurting and they are more my family than my own family has been and got me through an awful time in my life.  She asked if her boyfriend/my ex was my abuser.  I didn't give details, because I don't want to mess up anything good he's got going on (I need him to improve for our daughter), but part of me didn't want to scare her off because my daughter's safer if she's around.  She has kids, boys the same age as my older ones, and my ex - during child drop off - mentioned that one of them has anxiety issues.  Internally I freaked, because my mind went to my middle boy who's got adhd and struggles socially, talking to himself in the same manner my ex used to.  Having to discuss my ex's behavior with my ex-husband because it got brought up during sessions with their psychiatrist (adhd medication management).   I wanted nothing more than to not end up like my mom.  In some ways I haven't, and I'm proud of myself for that.  But I've got a long way to go to forgive myself for not putting them first and getting them away from that environment sooner.  Every move I make now is to ensure a peaceful home environment and luckily they have a lot of support all around, so they'll be okay I think.  I do talk to them about stuff that happened and why abuse occurs and that we can't hold on to anger towards that person, we just have to hope that they can heal whatever hurt them...and we don't have to spend time with people that don't make us feel good/scared, but we also don't have to hurt them or wish more on them. 

That being said, and maybe it's my inner child's lack of understanding - Covid has really put a hamper on finding a therapist (I need in-person therapy - I have adhd myself, if you haven't noticed yet lol, so phone stuff is difficult) but what if this isn't a phase?

What if he actually changes?

Obviously, that would be the most amazing thing - my dad went on to raise another family and I don't want that for her, so he HAS to change in order for that to be successful...

I know that a lot of these things were not a result of who I am as a person, and I don't allow behavior that isn't productive so I feel like I've got a decent grip on the logical side of things...but right now, with not being able to properly do my job (activities in a retirement/long-term care facility), feeling like I failed my kids (I'm much less patient than I used to be, I'm really working on that), my mental and physical health being out of sorts from years of neglect due to trying to survive on top of autoimmune thyroid issues, adhd, only having one hand with my residual limb starting to suffer overuse after 13 years, and not being able to see a professional - it's hitting me a little harder that he's treating her so well.  

I'm not a bad person, and while math isn't my strong suit - I can still count to 15 depending on my shoe choice - and I understand common denominators.  I know I have value.  But, why wasn't I worth being treated better?  The thought of an apology makes me horrendously sad, because it won't fix anything.  I love what I have now.  But I still lost regular access to seeing his two kids that I formed a relationship with, and now I have to share time with my sweet baby and nothing will ever change that, no matter how well he treats people from here on out.  That makes me really sad, and I don't know why.",domesticviolence,"I know it's probably a phase, but it still hurts.",https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/h9mbmj/i_know_its_probably_a_phase_but_it_still_hurts/,True

This is an almost an exclusively white neighborhood.  When we met he spoke about how there were racists in his last apartment complex and I assured him that my girlfriend and I and the other tenant were not racist.

About two weeks after he moved in, we heard him and girlfriend yelling at each other.  Sometimes it was during the day, sometimes it would be in the middle of the night.  We never said anything because we didn't know how to address it.  We told the landlord a few times about it and we don't know how he addressed it but he said he did.

Eventually we could hear things getting physical.  It sounded like there was a knock down drag out fight happening next door.  We called the cops.  When the cops came the couple had left the apartment to go for a walk and the cops couldn't really do anything.  As a white person, I was very hesitant to call the cops on a black man.  As far as I know he doesn't know we have called the cops.

There has been little noise coming from their apartment but we hear some things now and again.  When the girlfriend isn't wearing long sleeve shirts you can see the bruises on her arms.

Today I heard his girlfriend yell, ""stop, you're hurting me!""  We called the landlord and our landlord called him.  We could hear our neighbor yelling at the landlord that he was afraid for his life and that she is having medicine issues and it makes her scream.  He feels like everyone hates him and that we're playing around with his life.  Our landlord said he spoke with the girlfriend and she said she wasn't being abused.  Which I do not think that any victim would say they were being abused while the accused is in the same room.

We do not know how to resolve this issue.  We want to talk to them but they seem to not be admitting what's going on.  I could be wrong I suppose, maybe she's has an issue that makes her yell and scream in the middle of the night when no one is abusing her.   I don't want to call the cops on a black man where things could escalate and he could be killed.  I don't want to do nothing and let either one of them hurt the other one.  Its causing us real emotional distress having to listen to it.  It doesn't seem like it's a good idea to confront your neighbors about how one of them is being abused or how they might be abusing each other.

I have lived in an abusive relationship for about 5 years now and finally got rid of him in a few months ago. It went far (as usual with this guy) and he got a restraining order, after I called the cops on him ( I really had to, he was drunk and was chasing me in my own apt). 

But this was not the first time. It has happened 7 or 8 times before that he has gone violent on me to the point that I had to call the police. I know l, I've been stupid to take him back but trust me, ge is a master manipulator and said all the right things when he was ""sorry"". 

He used to get drunk or high and made me break up with him since he was a coward and couldn't do it. I hope you get the picture here. All of this has been very painful to me, bc I really loved him. I have now, since the last time he fucked up, decided to never take him back again and kept my promise. 

He hasn't contacted me, but i know that is only bc there is a restraining order on him. I'm sure he'll reach out one way or another and do as usual, beg me to come back for he has changed an so on. 

I now understand that he never loved me and only wanted to owe me and use my energy so I promised myself to not give him another second of my life.

Then came the call. Today, the day after my birthday and it was my lawyer, telling me that the cops want to speak to me one last time and then they have enough to prosecute him and it will go to court. The probability of him getting a jail sentence is high. 

Now comes the dilemma. I want to leave this behind. I'm happy I have the restraining order so he won't come near for another 4 months at least , but I am so so afraid. If I do proceed with this, it will take more of my time and energy that I really don't want to put in this bs anymore, cuz I'm so tired of this drama, but if I don't do it he probably won't leave me alone.

Wtf should I do. I study at uni and really want to focus on that. That's really all I want to do. I just want him to leave me alone.",domesticviolence,"Damned if I do, damned if I don't..",https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/ha5ken/damned_if_i_do_damned_if_i_dont/,True

So she first started by standing on me when she thought I was pregnant even though I was just twelve back then (a few months ago) and I had no boyfriend and it was just and irregular period (she didn’t even let me take the test) 
But then after wards she started doing stuff like trying to stab me with scissors, chasing me trough the house with knives, threatening to kill me, forcing me to take 3 strips of birth control....cause she thought I was pregnant and we are already involved with cps (they don’t know about this) and she doesn’t want my brothers (and apparently me) to get taken away from her.. 
she was also diagnosed with psychosis a few years ago.. so she kinda has this weird story that’s she keeps on saying, that’s kinda like she thinks people can read her mind , if she sees anything on internet she pretends it’s aimed directly at her and says people are bullying her (it doesn’t even have to be bad) so once I heard yelling from downstairs and then she came to my door mad and kept on telling me to open it I was scared so I kept on saying stuff to stall like “why?” “I don’t want to if ur gonna hurt me...” she ended up kicking the door open and strangling me...
She’s hit me with a broom/mop stick before 
A piece of wood (it broke, but she used the excuse that it was already breaking even though I’m sure it wasn’t) etc.
But it’s like sometimes she’s like that and other times she’s acting as if she loves me...
Like around two weeks ago is the last time she hurt me, my school changed the transportation for school and said that someone would drive the students that live far away (including me) but then changed it again and said that wasn’t gonna happen she got mad and started blaming me for it and went into my room yelling for me to call my homeroom teacher I was looking at her cuz other wise she’d probably find it disrespectful but at the same time hoping that she didn’t think I was rolling my eyes cuz she often says that I’m rolling my eyes at her when all I’m doing is just looking at her this time was no different she thought I was rolling my eyes and hit me with a plate she aimed for my head but I blocked it with my arm I got a bruise but it wasn’t that visible and I got a wound (kinda looking like a dot of blood but at the same time it wasn’t bleeding) she continued yelling at me.... 
but now around two weeks later she hasn’t hit me since then (she has insulted me once again for things I couldn’t possibly control) but today she apologized after asking why I wasn’t that close with her and seemed to be “unhappy with her” so I mentioned the fact that she strangled me and she blamed it on me said it was my fault cuz I did (once again something I couldn’t possibly control) anyway later she came to my room and just said she wanted to make up with me.. so she said just sorry and kept on talking my door was closed but she kept asking for me to open it.. eventually I got kinda tired of hearing the same thing over and over again so I opened my door cuz I knew she probably wasn’t gonna go away.. she kinda hugged me all happy like a little child when she said something like yay or yes she forgives me or something like that.. but idk she could start hurting me at anytime again.. also even if she doesn’t am I supposed to just let it go as if it never happened in the first place I feel like I’m being over dramatic for not just letting it go.. and even though she did all that a lot I barely got any bruises so was it really that bad? Also would anyone even believe me if I tell them with zero evidence... it’s not like I have nightmares or something.. sometimes I do think she’s gonna hit me again and I flinch but that’s really all....... 

(TL;DR: so my mom with psychosis started “disciplining”(for stuff I couldn’t control) (and threatening to kill me) me a while ago but the last time she did it was a few weeks ago and she apologized today, she could do it anytime again but could also not.. do idk what to do...btw I’m a 13 girl with two brothers..and my dad lives in another city he’s coming to visit tomorrow tho..(before This she acted abusive towards my stepdad (who would never hurt her btw) but he committed... a few years ago also I don’t live in the US so the rules might be a bit different here)",domesticviolence,So I kinda need advice (I also posted this on another subreddit),https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/h8flm2/so_i_kinda_need_advice_i_also_posted_this_on/,True

(Some background information: I’m transgender female-to-male and had been struggling a long time with my sexuality)

I dated a guy (we’ll call him Michael) for 11 months. I knew going into the relationship that he identified as asexual and I was fine with that. A little while into the relationship, Michael told me that he was a survivor of sexual assault and had PTSD. He told me his triggers, and I made sure to avoid them at all costs. A few months into the relationship, Michael expressed that he was interested in trying sexual things with me. We went slow — I made sure I never pressured him to do anything he didn’t want to, I avoided his triggers, and frequently checked to see if everything was alright. Everything was going fine — sometimes he’d get upset or overwhelmed, but we’d stop immediately and I’d always be there to comfort him. Eventually he got a lot more comfortable with sex so it happened more often. Then the end of the semester came (we’re both in college), and he began getting really stressed. 

He was in crisis just about every day. I tried to be there for him whenever he was upset, but it was becoming extremely taxing on me and my own mental health. It got to the point that I couldn’t take it anymore, so I told him I was feeling extremely emotionally worn out and asked him to find someone else to talk to about his issues. He apologized, but he didn’t stop. In fact, it got worse. The smallest thing could send him into deep self loathing to the point that I was extremely afraid of saying anything that might set him off. He had hurt himself in front of me before, so I was always afraid of what he might do if I spoke up about how basically being his therapist was affecting me.

Needless to say, I was more than relieved when summer cam around and I could go back to my home all the way across the country. Over the summer, I finally started passing as male. I also started to realize that I didn’t feel comfortable with the romantic side of my relationship with Michael and came out to him as aromantic. He agreed to stop doing very overtly romantic things in order to make me more comfortable. However, he didn’t stop — he kept doing things that I was uncomfortable with, becoming inconsolable when I’d confront him, and telling me that it was his depression/PTSD that was making it hard for him to remember. I figured that I couldn’t be angry with him since it was his mental illness and was beyond his control, so I just sucked it up and didn’t say anything about it again. 

Summer ended and I went back to school for the fall. A month or two later, I realized I was also very uncomfortable with the sexual side of our relationship as well and ended up I coming out to him as asexual. We agreed that we’d have more of a dedicated partnership than a romantic relationship and that we wouldn’t do anything else sexual because I told him I was extremely uncomfortable with it. 

But again, even though he was a sexual assault survivor who was always pushing consent, he didn’t stop sexual advances. It would start gradually enough that I wouldn’t realize until it was too late (for example, we’d be laying down with each other in bed and suddenly I’d realize his hands were where I didn’t want them to be). At this point, I wanted to say no, but then I’d remember how he had banged his head against the wall as self-punishment and thought he didn’t deserve to live for forgetting to turn on the fan above the stove — what would he do if I told him he had done something sexual to me without his consent? Or implied that he had done the same thing that the person who assaulted him did? He had told me from the beginning of the relationship that that was his greatest fear. 

So, afraid of what he might do to himself if I spoke up, I just let it happen. I’d even comfort him afterwards when he’d get upset and tell me that he hadn’t even wanted to do it. It made absolutely no sense to me since I had asked for us to stop doing sexual things for an indefinite amount of time and now here I was, having to comfort him after he had gone ahead with sex anyways and then claimed he never wanted to do it in the first place. This happened a few times, and I blamed myself for having somehow probably pressured him — why else would he have done it? He was asexual after all, right? Anyways, I ended up breaking up with him after winter break when I realized that I wasn’t aromantic or asexual, I just liked women instead of men (at one point in my life liking women was considered gay since I was living as a girl, so bad reactions from others had pushed me to believe I was bisexual). 

I blocked Michael on every social media platform I could think of, but ended up confronting him through tumblr messaging, telling him what he had done to me and the damage it had caused. He replied by saying “I was trapped in my worst memories, and it made it hard to remember where I was, who I was with, what was talked about”. 

Now I’m trying to figure out how much he can really be held accountable for what he did. On one hand, he created an environment where saying no could be dangerous and he also initiated sex after I had withdrawn consent indefinitely. On the other hand, he had severe mental health issues. I’m struggling to figure out if I’m allowed to put the blame on him and how much his mental health issues made it so that it really wasn’t his fault. 

So basically, is he still to blame even if his mental health issues made him forget all those things? Or is it even possible that depression, PTSD, or OCD can make you forget things like that? (For context, he was still able to do fine in classes and didn’t seem extremely mentally impaired)",domesticviolence,Do I even have the right to be mad?

There was at time I felt safe with you by my side, there weren't many but this one I will carry always. See, people ask me why did you stay with him through all of that. That isn't an easy thing to explain to those who've never experienced violence and gas-lighting to the extent of diminishment of self. 
I guess I held onto that moment for deeper than I should have, perhaps because it was the only glisten of humanity I saw, even though it was for yourself. 
I was in labour with our son, far earlier than what doctors decide is viable life. We were in the hospital watching the clock, timing. You were there by my side. You were holding me telling me everything was going to be okay. You were my rock when I needed it the most. I know now that you didn't do it for me. That was an act for you and your observers because we both know that in their notes, your actions were the reason we were there.

When I look back, it is so blatantly clear. You were the hunter, I was your prey.

You used my fears and my secrets I confided to you, to chip away at my self, to wear me down and groom me into a drudge you controlled.

At every glisten of me you would suppress, with your words, your hands, and your prick. Every action, every utterance you did, stripped another layer from my spirit, what it was to be me, to live.

I couldn't see it then, I believed your lies that something must be wrong with me, though I see it now. Through your demons you battered me until who I was, was gone.

You had this power of forging me into believing everything you said, that I deserved it, that I was stupid, that I was worthless if not for that act you used against me, that I was fucked in the head.

You stripped me, in all ways, back to my bones. I had become nothing other than a shell and your slave. Even then though it wasn't good enough, you had taken away my family, my friends, marked my sanity and deprived my dignity. You still wanted more, so that Wednesday in May, you took my light too.

I was resigned. I had succumbed to your whim, this was all I am for the rest of my life until you decide my body was expendable too. I mattered no more and just waited for my death at your hands. When that didn't come (yet), you lost the control. I got out.

No longer could your words, or your fists or that grip on my wrist make me do what you wanted.

You couldn't bear people knowing all that you had done, how dare I tell. So you took that fear you induced, you took that pain you caused, you took my secrets I shared and tried to spread them in shame. You told the world trauma you inflicted on me was made up in my mind, you fought against onus and still do to this day, in your words by your postings ""I will win"".

Oh but honey, this isn't a game.

I know that in reading this, if you are ever compelled to, it probably turns you on. A small list of your achievements, you won't read this as ever having done anything wrong.
Though this isn't that. I'm not asking for recognition nor is it a gift of forgiveness, no. You don't deserve a place of peace in my heart and I don't care to give it because I am not afraid, I've already lived in hell.

I want you to know that in fact, in some way, I am grateful. See, without being completely broken I wouldn't have been able to build up. I couldn't have breathed without feeling safe, I couldn't have smiled without feeling happiness deep, I couldn't have felt without knowing strength. If not for all the torture you forced me through, I couldn't have become who I am today, proud, strong, brave and unashamed.

I did that.

You are nothing without triumph of my defeat. I am everything you don't want in me, and everything you wish people thought you could be.

I stand tall through the trauma, and the venom you spit. I'm unwavering in your last battle to make me quit because thanks to you, I have nothing to fear.
You have a lifetime of self vindicating, a lifetime of justifying incidences you won't admit but I, I have light and I have power, I own my shit.

I don’t bother anyone I pretty much stay in my room and go to work. I only moved my boyfriend in to help me with bills since my mom and sister doesn’t want to get a job. They have a problem with anything me and my boyfriend do for example they have issues with what we spend our money on and places we go another example is if anything comes up missing they blame it on my boyfriend then find the items and never apologize. I never make big deals about It I just move on from it. Just recently I was on the phone talking to my friend and my sister comes banging at my door asking me why I’m talking about her which I wasn’t but even if I was how dare you break my door down and try to fight me over something your not sure is really going on. I’m very laid back I try to laugh everyday and be happy and people hate seeing that so they try to do anything to get me down. They only try to bother me when my boyfriend is at work which is funny. I feel like their jealous and bored with their lives so they want to bother me because they know I don’t like confrontation. I feel like they project all their insecurities onto me.

Some people in the replies kinda warned me that she’d probably do it again.. today I got scared and thought she would so this morning she got really mad because she found my older brothers keys outside and they’ve been there since yesterday she got really upset and said that anyone could’ve entered our house she started yelling at my brother who also got really mad and said that he wasn’t the one that left the keys there she said that they were his keys and he was responsible for it and he quickly tried to blame me for leaving the keys outside but I have my own keys and didn’t use his and he knows that but still started hitting and kicking my door trying to open it and threatening me all because he was tryna but my moms attention and the blame on me so he wouldn’t be yelled at or blamed for it then my mom came upstairs and he went to his room upset and then my mom started hitting and kicking my door (and blaming me for stuff that didn’t happen and I couldn’t control that also had nothing to do with the situation) I got scared because it reminded me of all the times she did that wich always led to her hurting me eventually she kicked it open like she always does she was upset but didn’t hurt me (luckily) but I could’ve made one wrong move and she would’ve... in that moment I did really wish I told someone because I got really scared but after wards I couldn’t imagine telling anyone...(i know it isn’t but it just really feels embarrassing)


so I didn’t really know what to do people in the replies from last night told me to tell someone.. but I don’t really know who I’m gonna tell... some people said my teacher but my mom chose to make me stay home because of the virus so I don’t go to school... and telling them online just seems awkward and I can’t even imagine how they’d react.
Then some people said to tell my dad.. but he only comes and visits sometimes and sometimes I text him but he doesn’t read the messages cuz he didn’t get them he was supposed to visit today but didn’t show up..(butmy mom and him are calling and playing a game with my little brother rn while my older brother plays a games with his friend) 
And then some people said tell you’re social worker well... I’ve really seen multiple people and honestly those are all people from CPS or they work close to them and I always tell them everything’s fine so telling any of them is just..embarrassing or awkward for me I don’t know how to talk to people well.. I’m always worried what they think of me.. also even though I’ve seen them a couple of times over the years it almost feels like they’re strangers.. and whenever I see them my moms there... and I have literally no evidence at all to show that what I’m saying is true I have like one bruise that’s almost completely gone and you can barely see so now I’m worried about who to tell.. how to tell them.. whether they’re gonna believe me or not..and how they’re gonna react and what they’re gonna do if I tell them.....and also people have it worse than me... the last time she hurt me was a while ago would it really count......
I know everything I said probably sounds irrational like why don’t I just tell someone why am I being like this...

Eventually my father also started abusing my step mom, he nearly killed her twice. This continued till I was 16 and they separated. I was shipped off to boarding school, happiest two years of my life. After school got over, I joined college in a neighbouring city, things have been fine the last three years when I lived by myself.

This is my first time posting in this sub, the mods from r/relationships sent me to you guys. Please forgive any irregularities. 

I recently moved back in with my parents. They fight. A lot. Nasty, screaming-match fights that can last for days. They had a child last year which has naturally created new tensions in the house, mostly because my stepfather contributes substantially less to childcare than my mother. It's obvious he loves the baby, but he often leaves my mother to do 70–90% of the grunt work (e.g. napping while she's in tears from back pain and needs help with the baby, spending hours at the gym/not adjusting any part of his pre-baby schedule, etc.) They are both currently unemployed and basically in the house together 24/7. To be honest it's clear that he's not equally contributing and it's grinding her down, but they don't communicate well at all and the whole situation is generating a lot of resentment. He is currently doing CBT therapy for anger management, which was a stipulation of an ultimatum my mother apparently gave him to avoid divorce. Couples therapy is not currently an option for insurance reasons.

A few months ago he purchased a rifle for home defense. I believe it's an AR-15. It is not in a safe. It stays beside their bed in the case it was purchased in. The other week, they got into an argument that ended with my stepdad storming out of the house. My mom broke down in front of me and admitted that he recently said to her ""I should shoot you in the fucking head"" while they were having a fight. Guys, I don't have the words to describe what hearing that felt like. It was a sickening, primal fear. My face must have given me away because she instantly regretted telling me, and spent the next half hour reassuring me that she felt completely safe and knew for a fact that he would never harm her. But what mother wouldn't?

My stepdad has never struck me as the violent type. He's a bit more confrontational than my mother and I, but I've always attributed that to his hailing from a more urban, crowded part of the country than us. I have always felt completely and totally safe around him. He has been in my life since I was a teenager, and I've come to view him as my true father, which only makes this worse. I feel guilty for the fears that I'm having. He has done so much for me, and has supported me in so many ways, and here I am, scared that he might harm my mom or my sibling or all of us. I will say that he is ex-military (non-combat) and ex-NFL, and we have suspected for some time that he may suffer from CTE.

I am physically ill with paranoia. They have been screaming most of the day, and with every lull in the argument I'm terrified that I will hear gunshots. I know this is very macabre, and it might just be my anxiety rearing its ugly head, but my quality of life has dropped significantly since this began. I don't have a big biological family. My mother and sibling are all I have, and if something were to happen to them, my life would be over. I just don't know what to do. My mom is financially dependent on him, and she does not have a degree. If I were to do anything that would remove either of them from this house, she and the baby (and myself) would be homeless and without any money. And although I feel horribly selfish even thinking about my own situation, this is really taxing me emotionally. I'm trying to get through college while also working part-time, and now I have this nightmarish anxiety always waiting for me at home. On top of that, I'm often left to care for the baby in a separate room while they fight. I can't do it all. It's eating me up.

My longterm boyfriend (24M) who, admittedly, is much more level-headed and much less anxious than I am, is trying to reassure me that my stepdad wouldn't hurt my mother. He thinks it was purely a heat of the moment anger that spilled out, and perhaps a result of my stepdad's military/police training. And really, I have never once felt unsafe around my stepfather until this happened. But I'm trying to look at the facts here, which are:

* There is a gun in the house that is in plain sight at all times, not in a safe.
* They are having bitter, drawn out fights every other week or so, often within the same space as the weapon.
* They are constantly in close proximity with little reprieve from one another.
* He has impulsively threatened to shoot her.
* It is possible that he has suffered brain injuries that can impact decision-making.
* Also a fact is that the best predictor of future behavior is past behavior, and my stepdad has never laid a hand on my mother (that I know of.)

What do I do? What *can* I do? What *should* I do? Am I overreacting? Any advice will be appreciated so much. 

TLDR; My stepdad threatened to shoot my mother in the head during a recent argument. He owns a gun which he doesn't keep locked up. They are having intense arguments several times a month, primarily surrounding tensions caused by my new baby sibling. He has never hurt me or my mother, and is by all accounts a kind person, but the paranoia is wearing me down. Neither my mother nor myself are in a position to leave the house, and I don't even know if that's something that should be considered. I am juggling school, work, the fear of my mother being harmed, and the responsibility of caring for my sibling while they fight. I am overwhelmed, scared, and confused.

Last night my boyfriend and father of my child raped me. It was my birthday. My first night out, baby with a sitter, for the first time in over a year. I got intoxicated and a took one single hit of weed. I was unable to walk, I had slurred speech, confusion, and I think I periodically passed out. My boyfriend was pretty much sober, however. 
He brought me to bed and I was laying on my back. At first I thought I was dreaming when I realized he wasn’t listening to me saying “no “ repeatedly. I used my arms to try and push him away. I said I don’t want this, I don’t know who you are, and even cried “rape” over and over. Nothing stopped him. I couldn’t believe he could be capable of this. I remember crying “no, not YOU! Not you not you!” Because I never imagined he was capable of this... 
This morning I woke up and sat up in disbelief. I wanted to believe it was a nightmare. But he woke up to. He seemed irritated and asked if I remember last night. I said I had a bad dream. He said it was real, that I kept crying rape, saying no, that I don’t know him. So there’s no doubt in my mind that this all happened. But I’m shocked that he so readily confessed to it like he doesn’t see a problem ?! He admits I was blacked out, didn’t want sex, cried rape, but he chose to continue anyway.

I need advice and your opinions/ and any personal experience you might have relating to my situation. I've {female 21 yr} been dating my boyfriend {male 20yrs} for about 2 years, its been up and down definitely toxic at times, but recently as we've both been going to therapy and getting help we have been better than ever. Some background on my boyfriend, his father is very abusive and has been his whole life, he still lives with his parents &amp; his environment at home is usually very toxic. Yesterday I was over at his parents house and we were watching a show in his room, his younger sister {shes 9 years old} came and watched it with us, my boyfriend fell asleep quickly so I let him be and am just enjoying the show with his little sister. As time passes its about 8pm, I decide to wake him up because I know that he won't be able to fall asleep later that night if he keeps napping. Hes probably been asleep for about an hour and a half maybe more, so I gently wake him &amp; hes pretty grumpy and annoyed. I explain to him that I just wanted him to be able to fall asleep later and that it was getting late. He's still half asleep and I let him be for a few mins- i lovingly put my head on his and nudge him a few times (I can see how that would be annoying but its out of love) he then gets very angry and raises his voice telling me to cut it out. I tell him I have to go soon and want to hangout with him before I go and I nudge him again. He rolls over facing me and backhands me in the face, it was hard. Sometimes we play rough but this was uncalled for and it really hurt. When he slapped me obviously his sister heard it and she put her hand on my face and said hes a meanie, but maybe she thought we were just playing around. A few seconds passed by and my boyfriend didn't do or say anything, I was furious like blood boiling angry and hurt. So I get up and go to the restroom worried I would cry in front of his sister. After I get my stuff I say I'm going home, I did not want to be there as it was only past 8pm my boyfriend and his sister are surprised because I usually stay later. I walk out and head to my car. My boyfriend has the audacity to ask why I'm leaving and I'm dumbfounded. I even say are you fucking kidding me you slapped me in the face &amp; you did it in front of your little sister? He says he doesn't REMEMBER slapping me and that it was on accident and points out that nothing like this has ever happened before. I keep my distance and don't say much after he gives his speech saying he's sorry and bs he tries to tell me to come inside. HELL no he asks for a hug and I say no thanks and I get in my car and leave. He has never hit me before, although his slap was hard it didn't cause damage to my face, but I feel so disrespected and that its a huuuuge red flag. He keeps saying he loves me, that he's sorry and that it was an accident. Am I stupid to believe him? Because part of me wants to and then my rational side kicks in and smells the bullshit. Should I leave him? I may have low self-worth but something like this I will not stand for or forgive. They say once your partner hits you most likely they will again and I'm afraid that if I don't leave that it will.

Physically, mentally, emotionally and financially. He’s currently facing 20 years because he tried to kill me. This was just under a year ago (we separated over a year ago) and, while I have come to terms with what happened, the emotional and physical scars still exist. I have been formally diagnosed with ptsd - the effects of which I am still learning to recognize and cope with. 

After I moved to a new city, found a job, my own place, got a dog and became settled I met and became friends with a man through work. After his relationship ended we started dating (it’s been almost 3 months). We were close when we were friends and are even closer now. 

He treats me well, he is kind to me and others, he helps the local community and is hard-working. Even so, I find myself sabotaging our relationship because of my past. I am easily triggered and I find ways to ‘hate’ him. I nit-pick his actions trying to somehow uncover his eventual abuse in some kind of “ta-da, gotcha” type way. 

People always say “trust your gut” but I don’t know what that looks like any more. I’m always second guessing myself to the point that it feels like I’m gaslighting....myself. I don’t trust him when I am triggered nor do I trust myself. I feel like I’m going crazy. 

I name-call (he does not) and yell (he does not). It’s like I have become the abuser because I am so used to having to constantly be on the defense. I don’t want to be this way, feel this way or treat him this way. I don’t want to be the reason our relationship fails. 

He is incredibly supportive and has said he will work to build my trust and to understand my triggers. I feel like such a burden and so pathetic - my need to feel strong and how I try to achieve that is my weakness.

Almost everyone in my family has been abused and has in turn abused. There's other fucked up shit like grandparents being related to each other and a host of medical and mental problems. Our mother abused us when we were younger for no reason, not that abusers ever need a reason to abuse. My goal since I was a child was just to get away from this fucked up family and never look back.

Our father never defended us from our mother, and I will never forgive him for that, but we grew closer over the last few years. At the same time, I don't really know what influenced my brother to become the abuser he is now. Sure, I am also full of rage about my mother's past abuse and how everyone denied it, justified it or made excuses. But it couldn't have just been that.

My brother has flunked school, started drinking and smoking weed, and doesn't try hard enough to not be a NEET. Besides that, about 2 years ago he started assaulting our mother and breaking objects, including stuff he needs. He assaulted our mother during last Christmas lunch in front of my mum's side of the family. He even started to scream at me and insult me for being too 'smart' and 'uppity' in conversations. Everyone thinks he's extremely jealous of me because I'm doing so well despite my circumstances.  Then recently we found out he's been smoking weed for the past few months and does not intend to stop it.

The worst thing is that sometimes I think the assaults are my fault. I try to talk to him as little as possible. But sometimes, it'll go from one of us asking to pass the salt, to my brother insulting me, and then him arguing with one of my parents, and someone assaulted or something broken.

My parents didn't want to go to the police because they didn't want him to have a criminal record. They attempted to make a report once but found a pretty shitty police service (normal in our area), so they didn't do it. At first my parents tried to discipline him. But it only made him more volatile. So then they just tried to help him. He never responded to anything, just kept getting worse and worse. He literally does what he likes and we can't control him.

As of now he's broken: 2 old but useful laptops, 3 new phones, his bathroom mirror, the fruit bowl, our stained glass door, 2 glasses, a jar of peanut butter, a computer, a fan, glass sheets on the furniture, damaged the furniture, a chair, a wifi router and my dad's nose.

The last 7 items all came from one instance yesterday, the worst it's ever been. As usual it started with something simple. Me and him got into an argument, over the weed and everything. Then my parents started to talk to him and took over the conversation. He started screaming and insulting my father, screaming that he's a faggot, pufta. My father just locked himself in the bedroom to get away from it. Then he and my mother argued for a minute before his screaming got out of control. He ran into the corridor, slammed the door almost off its hinges, grabbed the monitor and the chair there and threw them to our side of the corridor. They hit and broke the fan and the glass sheet on the furniture. That's when my father came out and shouted at him to get out. As usual they grappled, my father trying to force him out. My brother ended up punching him hard in the nose and ran out.

He punched him so hard there was blood spatter on the wall and black blood immediately started gushing, streaming out of his nose. There were blood drops on the floor all over the place, especially in the sink where he tried to get himself clean. As we were cleaning and the next day, we still found little droplets on random places like the TV screen. There was so much blood coming out we ended up calling the police for an ambulance. The ambulance never arrived (again, shitty police) so my mother went to take my dad to a clinic herself. 

I stayed home. My brother came to the door about 20 minutes after they left. He's been kicked out countless times and knows to take a very long walk or stay out for a few hours before even attempting to come back in. But lately he'd been trying to bash our door down when he got kicked out. He showed up with such nonchalance after being out for only an hour, and expected to be let back in. My parents told me not to let him in for my own safety and I didn't. I told him what they said, that they were never ever going to let him back in again and that he was a criminal, and I cursed at him to get out of there. He left.

And then I started recording the destruction that had occurred, all the damage and the blood in video. My dad usually records that stuff but I wanted to have my own personal record. It's a good thing I did because he was so shocked that he didn't record anything. The entire time I was so calm, I never shed one tear, if I cry then that's extremely rare for me. And I'm ashamed to say that while half my rage towards my brother was because of my dad's injury, the other half was because he broke the computer where I would play video games. 

At this time it was about 9 at night. I stayed up waiting for my parents, waiting to see if my brother got back, waiting to just see what would happen. I watched some Netflix just because nothing else could effectively distract me enough to pass the time. Then my parents came back at about 11. My dad got a doctor's certificate, certifying that his injury was grievous and that his nose had been broken. They had talked and decided that either my brother was going to co-operate with social workers and counselors or they would prosecute him in court to get him out of the house.

I went to sleep because I was so dead tired. In the morning I found out that my brother had not returned and was effectively missing. We waiting until 1 in the afternoon and were in the process of reporting him missing when he turned up. Apparently he walked to a friend's house and slept there (apparently this kid has parents who literally don't give two shits if their kid is smoking weed in the basement or letting in strangers in the middle of the night). We asked him if he felt any shame in causing them that trouble, and he said no, no surprise. My father's face had swelled up and both his eyes had turned black, my brother showed no empathy, never even said a sorry, just said he didn't mean it to cover his ass.

As of now we're in the process of cleaning up all the damage and throwing some things away, and my parents decided not to reveal when they'll be taking him to social services, but it'll be soon.

My brother is dead to me. DEAD. Any good relationship we might have had he decided to ruin it with his petty jealousy. And I will never forgive him for doing what he did to my father, and distracting me from my studies with his daily arguing and screaming and assaults. In the last 5 years I've never seen him show empathy to anyone, or any responsibility for his duties and actions. He is effectively a parasite in our home who will eventually tear it down piece by piece if we let him live here. And the worst part is our grandparents on both sides who keep coddling him and telling us to treat him kindly even though they know about a lot of the stuff that's happened.",domesticviolence,My brother seriously injured our father and I don't think I coped in a typical way.

I think she might have a mental illness but its hard to tell because she hasn't ever seen any therapist or psychologist about it. She refuses to speak to me ever, so I asked my mom to initiate the conversation with her to see a professional. My mother has spoken to her, and my sister agreed but then they both seemed to forget about it and nothing came of that. 

My mother (53) and my sister are close. My mother is easily manipulated. She's always been a rooter for the underdog and has always had the personality where she wants to help everyone. This is how my sister sucks her in. My mother listens to her sop stories about how life is so hard and her self esteem is just so low; then my mother falls for it. 

Noth my mom and sister have hysterical outbursts sometimes at various people in my family. Often times over silly, small things. If my sister is upset about something my mother acts as her lapdog and begins doing her bidding. They often gang up on myself and my dad. 

My father (60) is a little slow mentally, and old. He was not the best father or husband growing up and my sister harbours a deep hatred for him. She picks fights with him and my mom does her bidding. My sister is extremely controlling. For example, the other day she picked a fight with my dad because he opened to juice bottle on the dinner table before she could open it. 

This is taking its toll on both my mother and father, and possibly my sister too. My mother is developing an addiction to asprin and sleeps for most of the day. She also complains of physical ailments. My father has severe heart disease and is not taking it well either. 

I try to do my best to maintain a non-toxic environment, but its not working out.

At first we didnt notice anything awry, but their relationship soon showed its true colors in a nasty way. Jane seems subdued and as if she's walking on eggshells around Tom, but has a completely different and more vibrant personality when she's on her own. Tom more and more has been berating Jane for the tiniest things in front of us and our other friends, sometimes embarrassing Jane to the point of tears. 

He claps at her to get her attention like an animal, and talks down to her constantly. Recently she had their first child, and things have definitely escalated with the stress of/control issues surrounding  their new baby. Sometimes we say something to refute what he's saying if he says something such as ""Jane, you're a bad mother"", we might respond ""Jane, I think youre doing a great job"".

However, Jane has confided in private that she'd prefer if we didnt say anything as it would only make it worse for her. She says she knows he was this way when she decided to marry him and she will put up with it. This is so worrying to me as, especially during the lockdown, who knows what she is having to put up with if he hasn't been able to hold it together just for the few times we've seen them in the past 6 months. 

Their child is certainly already being affected by the yelling and vitriol of their parent's relationship... she rarely sleeps, is colicky and seems ill at ease compared with other children the same age. It could be a coincidence for the time being, or a projection on my part, but there's no way this poor girl will remain unharmed.

Recently Tom started talking about how he throws and breaks things and has outbursts of rage frequently at home directed at Jane. And a couple weeks ago he got out of his car to threaten another driver in a fit of road rage. Obviously this escalation is extremely concerning for Jane, so I am going to speak to her safely away from Tom on Monday.

A couple days ago my friends, myself and boyfriend went out of town together in our new car. While there, he decided to go visit his SICK brother who lives 1-2 hours away. He left without letting anyone know and when we would ask where he was he would say he was at the store. We all believed him because no one had eaten all day except for himself. Fast forward, because of the current situation we told him as a group we decided he should stay at his brothers since he could potentially have corona. He went ballistic and decided to come pick up his things in order to drive all the way back home. Even though we all (in exception for our friend who already lived in the area) came together in the new car. Through the phone he called me names and a friend who kind of knew about how he treats me hung up.
After a while after he came to pick up his things and yell at me from the balcony for the second time, I might add, I called him to make sure his drive was going smoothly. I told him he hurt our friends feelings after deciding to leave and continuously lie to them. He lost it. No lie. He started screaming at the top of his lungs, “YOURE A SNAKE! YOURE A SNAKE! I KNOW HOW YOU WORK. YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO HELP ME FIX THINGS, YOU COULDVE STOPPED THIS FROM HAPPENING. I HURTY OUR FRIENDS? LET ME RAM THIS CAR INTO A WALL AND THEN I CAN REALLY HURT THEIR FEELINGS. TELL ME AGAIN I HURT THEIR FEELINGS. TELL ME AGAIN. IM THE VICTIM NOT  YOU. ITS ME. ITS ALWAYS BEEN ME.” I started crying repeating no and no begging him to calm down. And then he hung up. 
A couple days ago he got mad at me because I started crying and decided to drive our car at 100 mph weaving through traffic. He then said “I wonder what would happen if I rammed this car into that bridge over there. What do you think babe?” I had to snap out of it and talk to him about my day in order to pretend everything was fine. 
After talking with our friends, we came to the conclusion he has either DID or schizo since he hears voices all the time which tell him to “get rid of her (me).” He has even chocked me during intimacy. I’m in constant fear he will either hurt me or himself.

He is an alcoholic, and while he wasn't physically and sexually abusive until the very end of the relationship back in August, he was often emotionally and psychologically abusive.

Yesterday it rained where I was. The weather was quite weird for where we are and the sky was a dark cloudy grey. The weather reminded me of this trip that we took to Alaska together. By all means it should have been a great trip. We went with my best friend from college and we got to see the northern lights.

However, there was a night that we left my friends behind and it was just me and him going in search of the northern lights. He got incredibly drunk, as per usual. He was driving us back to the hotel in our rental car and he was swerving a bit on this empty country road. I asked him to please pull over because I was scared and instead of pulling over, he drove faster and started swerving on purpose. I started screaming and threatened to jump out of the moving car. I even opened the door and was ready to jump until he pulled over. I ran outside and sat in the snow and refused to come back in. Dying from hypothermia was preferable to dying in a drunken crash.

I was driving when this memory hit me and I started panicking a bit. It felt so real, like I was there again.

I got to my current boyfriend's place and told him all about it and how scared I was. My current boyfriend is an angel and accepts me even though I have all these problems. My current boyfriend told me last night that he loved me, but I couldn't say it back. How can he be so sure already??? All I could think of was how broken I am and how I'm still thinking about my ex.

I have a history of being sexually assaulted, depression and suicidal thoughts and attempts. My (24f) husband (26m) and I have been together 5 years, got engaged and had 2 children. We were married in march. He's always been extremely jealous and controlling, but I felt pressure to stay work things out (yeah I know stupid me). 

This year things have gotten so much worse. Im a stay at home mom, I never leave the house because he either doesn't want to watch the kids or doesn't think its fair because he doesn't have any friends. I try to encourage him to make plans with someone but he wont. He always tells me how much he hates my friends because they drink and he doesn't want me to drink too. I've gone to a bar twice in the last 3 years and I hardly ever drink at home. 

We tried marriage counseling, and the counselor suggested I get a job because I'm depressed, exhausted and desperately need to interact with adults. I'm so lonely. Then covid-19 hit and there went my job searching. Im looking for one now but every one I mention to him he shits on and says I should just stay home. ""You would just get hit on anyways"" is what he says. Ridiculous.  

I had been on zoloft to treat my depression, but it caused me to lower my sex drive. That, coupled with the stress of raising 2 babies who REFUSED to sleep, you can imagine that part of our life stopped completely. He made get off completely. I didn't want to because it my life tolerable. I became depressed again and STILL didn't want sex. Over the weeks, maybe months, he coerced me into sex so many times after I clearly said no over and over. He even touched/penetrated me in my sleep. I have no idea how many times, I've only woken up to it twice. He let me drink one night, and he got drunk too. I was too drunk to do anything and he took advantage, even hit multiple times and had bruises the next day. 

Fast forward to this month, I had started seeing a counselor, to help me through my depression and stress. I told her how exhausted I was, and suggested I need to get out of the house at least 4-6 hours a week. I talked to my husband about what she said, and he immediately attacked me. ""well what about me? You are just gonna go out and drink and find someone else"" I told him no, I was planning on going out and joining a protest with my sister, Id forgotten how passionate I am my community and being involved. He lets me go. But not without a fight. ""Why are you putting makeup on? You never do that for me!"" Yes I do. ""Why are you brushing your teeth, plan on kissing someone?"" Apparently hygiene equals cheating. It goes on until I leave. I come back and he digs through my pockets and finds my lipgloss. ""What do you need this for? It's flavored!"" It's the only lip gloss I own. ""Are you seriously saying I'm cheating because I wore lipgloss?"" He responded ""if the shoe fits!"" 

Today I was going through my Google drive and found old pics of me and my friend when she was modeling that I had pretty much forgotten about. They are from 4 years ago, some are ""promiscuous"" as in they show my butt (kinda). I'm going through them and thought he would get a laugh at how dumb and terrible they were. He flips a switch and immediately starts attacking me accusing me of hiding them from him because ""you knew I would never approve of you doing THAT!"" But back then I did show them to him, they were horrible and I only saved like 3 of them. He knew about the photoshoot. I never hid anything from him. ""You did hide them from me, and makes me wonder what else you're hiding!"" I couldn't take the accusations anymore, I said im going to my moms to drop off my sister (she witnessed everything and has seen/heard much more in past arguments). I go upstairs to put on a bra and he follows me. ""What do you need a bra for? What are you really going to?"" Why am I not allowed to wear a bra now? What the fuck? 

There's hundreds of incidents like this, the fights last for hours, sometimes days. I feel like im leaving so much out, but I cant make this post too long.

In the car with my sister, she tells me I need to get out NOW. That what he's doing is abusive but it hasn't really occurred to me.

So she first started by standing on me when she thought I was pregnant even though I was just twelve back then (a few months ago) and I had no boyfriend and it was just and irregular period (she didn’t even let me take the test) 
But then after wards she started doing stuff like trying to stab me with scissors, chasing me trough the house with knives, threatening to kill me, forcing me to take 3 strips of birth control....cause she thought I was pregnant and we are already involved with cps (they don’t know about this) and she doesn’t want my brothers (and apparently me) to get taken away from her.. 
she was also diagnosed with psychosis a few years ago.. so she kinda has this weird story that’s she keeps on saying, that’s kinda like she thinks people can read her mind , if she sees anything on internet she pretends it’s aimed directly at her and says people are bullying her (it doesn’t even have to be bad) so once I heard yelling from downstairs and then she came to my door mad and kept on telling me to open it I was scared so I kept on saying stuff to stall like “why?” “I don’t want to if ur gonna hurt me...” she ended up kicking the door open and strangling me...
She’s hit me with a broom/mop stick before 
A piece of wood (it broke, but she used the excuse that it was already breaking even though I’m sure it wasn’t) etc.
But it’s like sometimes she’s like that and other times she’s acting as if she loves me...
Like around two weeks ago is the last time she hurt me, my school changed the transportation for school and said that someone would drive the students that live far away (including me) but then changed it again and said that wasn’t gonna happen she got mad and started blaming me for it and went into my room yelling for me to call my homeroom teacher I was looking at her cuz other wise she’d probably find it disrespectful but at the same time hoping that she didn’t think I was rolling my eyes cuz she often says that I’m rolling my eyes at her when all I’m doing is just looking at her this time was no different she thought I was rolling my eyes and hit me with a plate she aimed for my head but I blocked it with my arm I got a bruise but it wasn’t that visible and I got a wound (kinda looking like a dot of blood but at the same time it wasn’t bleeding) she continued yelling at me.... 
but now around two weeks later she hasn’t hit me since then (she has insulted me once again for things I couldn’t possibly control) but today she apologized after asking why I wasn’t that close with her and seemed to be “unhappy with her” so I mentioned the fact that she strangled me and she blamed it on me said it was my fault cuz I did (once again something I couldn’t possibly control) anyway later she came to my room and just said she wanted to make up with me.. so she said just sorry and kept on talking my door was closed but she kept asking for me to open it.. eventually I got kinda tired of hearing the same thing over and over again so I opened my door cuz I knew she probably wasn’t gonna go away.. she kinda hugged me all happy like a little child when she said something like yay or yes she forgives me or something like that.. but idk she could start hurting me at anytime again.. also even if she doesn’t am I supposed to just let it go as if it never happened in the first place I feel like I’m being over dramatic for not just letting it go.. and even though she did all that a lot I barely got any bruises so was it really that bad?

(Some background information: I’m transgender female-to-male and had been struggling a long time with my sexuality)

I dated a guy (we’ll call him Michael) for 11 months. I knew going into the relationship that he identified as asexual and I was fine with that. A little while into the relationship, Michael told me that he was a survivor of sexual assault and had PTSD. He told me his triggers, and I made sure to avoid them at all costs. A few months into the relationship, Michael expressed that he was interested in trying sexual things with me. We went slow — I made sure I never pressured him to do anything he didn’t want to, I avoided his triggers, and frequently checked to see if everything was alright. Everything was going fine — sometimes he’d get upset or overwhelmed, but we’d stop immediately and I’d always be there to comfort him. Eventually he got a lot more comfortable with sex so it happened more often. Then the end of the semester came (we’re both in college), and he began getting really stressed. 

He was in crisis just about every day. I tried to be there for him whenever he was upset, but it was becoming extremely taxing on me and my own mental health. It got to the point that I couldn’t take it anymore, so I told him I was feeling extremely emotionally worn out and asked him to find someone else to talk to about his issues. He apologized, but he didn’t stop. In fact, it got worse. The smallest thing could send him into deep self loathing to the point that I was extremely afraid of saying anything that might set him off. He had hurt himself in front of me before, so I was always afraid of what he might do if I spoke up about how basically being his therapist was affecting me.

Needless to say, I was more than relieved when summer cam around and I could go back to my home all the way across the country. Over the summer, I finally started passing as male. I also started to realize that I didn’t feel comfortable with the romantic side of my relationship with Michael and came out to him as aromantic. He agreed to stop doing very overtly romantic things in order to make me more comfortable. However, he didn’t stop — he kept doing things that I was uncomfortable with, becoming inconsolable when I’d confront him, and telling me that it was his depression/PTSD that was making it hard for him to remember. I figured that I couldn’t be angry with him since it was his mental illness and was beyond his control, so I just sucked it up and didn’t say anything about it again. 

Summer ended and I went back to school for the fall. A month or two later, I realized I was also very uncomfortable with the sexual side of our relationship as well and ended up I coming out to him as asexual. We agreed that we’d have more of a dedicated partnership than a romantic relationship and that we wouldn’t do anything else sexual because I told him I was extremely uncomfortable with it. 

But again, even though he was a sexual assault survivor who was always pushing consent, he didn’t stop sexual advances. It would start gradually enough that I wouldn’t realize until it was too late (for example, we’d be laying down with each other in bed and suddenly I’d realize his hands were where I didn’t want them to be). At this point, I wanted to say no, but then I’d remember how he had banged his head against the wall as self-punishment and thought he didn’t deserve to live for forgetting to turn on the fan above the stove — what would he do if I told him he had done something sexual to me without his consent? Or implied that he had done the same thing that the person who assaulted him did? He had told me from the beginning of the relationship that that was his greatest fear. 

So, afraid of what he might do to himself if I spoke up, I just let it happen. I’d even comfort him afterwards when he’d get upset and tell me that he hadn’t even wanted to do it. It made absolutely no sense to me since I had asked for us to stop doing sexual things for an indefinite amount of time and now here I was, having to comfort him after he had gone ahead with sex anyways and then claimed he never wanted to do it in the first place. This happened a few times, and I blamed myself for having somehow probably pressured him — why else would he have done it? He was asexual after all, right? Anyways, I ended up breaking up with him after winter break when I realized that I wasn’t aromantic or asexual, I just liked women instead of men (at one point in my life liking women was considered gay since I was living as a girl, so bad reactions from others had pushed me to believe I was bisexual). 

I blocked Michael on every social media platform I could think of, but ended up confronting him through tumblr messaging, telling him what he had done to me and the damage it had caused. He replied by saying “I was trapped in my worst memories, and it made it hard to remember where I was, who I was with, what was talked about”. 

Now I’m trying to figure out how much he can really be held accountable for what he did. On one hand, he created an environment where saying no could be dangerous and he also initiated sex after I had withdrawn consent indefinitely. On the other hand, he had severe mental health issues. I’m struggling to figure out if I’m allowed to put the blame on him and how much his mental health issues made it so that it really wasn’t his fault. 

So basically, is he still to blame even if his mental health issues made him forget all those things? Or is it even possible that depression, PTSD, or OCD can make you forget things like that? (For context, he was still able to do fine in classes and didn’t seem extremely mentally impaired)",domesticviolence,Do I even have the right to be mad?

There was at time I felt safe with you by my side, there weren't many but this one I will carry always. See, people ask me why did you stay with him through all of that. That isn't an easy thing to explain to those who've never experienced violence and gas-lighting to the extent of diminishment of self. 
I guess I held onto that moment for deeper than I should have, perhaps because it was the only glisten of humanity I saw, even though it was for yourself. 
I was in labour with our son, far earlier than what doctors decide is viable life. We were in the hospital watching the clock, timing. You were there by my side. You were holding me telling me everything was going to be okay. You were my rock when I needed it the most. I know now that you didn't do it for me. That was an act for you and your observers because we both know that in their notes, your actions were the reason we were there.

When I look back, it is so blatantly clear. You were the hunter, I was your prey.

You used my fears and my secrets I confided to you, to chip away at my self, to wear me down and groom me into a drudge you controlled.

At every glisten of me you would suppress, with your words, your hands, and your prick. Every action, every utterance you did, stripped another layer from my spirit, what it was to be me, to live.

I couldn't see it then, I believed your lies that something must be wrong with me, though I see it now. Through your demons you battered me until who I was, was gone.

You had this power of forging me into believing everything you said, that I deserved it, that I was stupid, that I was worthless if not for that act you used against me, that I was fucked in the head.

You stripped me, in all ways, back to my bones. I had become nothing other than a shell and your slave. Even then though it wasn't good enough, you had taken away my family, my friends, marked my sanity and deprived my dignity. You still wanted more, so that Wednesday in May, you took my light too.

I was resigned. I had succumbed to your whim, this was all I am for the rest of my life until you decide my body was expendable too. I mattered no more and just waited for my death at your hands. When that didn't come (yet), you lost the control. I got out.

No longer could your words, or your fists or that grip on my wrist make me do what you wanted.

You couldn't bear people knowing all that you had done, how dare I tell. So you took that fear you induced, you took that pain you caused, you took my secrets I shared and tried to spread them in shame. You told the world trauma you inflicted on me was made up in my mind, you fought against onus and still do to this day, in your words by your postings ""I will win"".

Oh but honey, this isn't a game.

I know that in reading this, if you are ever compelled to, it probably turns you on. A small list of your achievements, you won't read this as ever having done anything wrong.
Though this isn't that. I'm not asking for recognition nor is it a gift of forgiveness, no. You don't deserve a place of peace in my heart and I don't care to give it because I am not afraid, I've already lived in hell.

I want you to know that in fact, in some way, I am grateful. See, without being completely broken I wouldn't have been able to build up. I couldn't have breathed without feeling safe, I couldn't have smiled without feeling happiness deep, I couldn't have felt without knowing strength. If not for all the torture you forced me through, I couldn't have become who I am today, proud, strong, brave and unashamed.

I did that.

You are nothing without triumph of my defeat. I am everything you don't want in me, and everything you wish people thought you could be.

I stand tall through the trauma, and the venom you spit. I'm unwavering in your last battle to make me quit because thanks to you, I have nothing to fear.
You have a lifetime of self vindicating, a lifetime of justifying incidences you won't admit but I, I have light and I have power, I own my shit.

Some people in the replies kinda warned me that she’d probably do it again.. today I got scared and thought she would so this morning she got really mad because she found my older brothers keys outside and they’ve been there since yesterday she got really upset and said that anyone could’ve entered our house she started yelling at my brother who also got really mad and said that he wasn’t the one that left the keys there she said that they were his keys and he was responsible for it and he quickly tried to blame me for leaving the keys outside but I have my own keys and didn’t use his and he knows that but still started hitting and kicking my door trying to open it and threatening me all because he was tryna but my moms attention and the blame on me so he wouldn’t be yelled at or blamed for it then my mom came upstairs and he went to his room upset and then my mom started hitting and kicking my door (and blaming me for stuff that didn’t happen and I couldn’t control that also had nothing to do with the situation) I got scared because it reminded me of all the times she did that wich always led to her hurting me eventually she kicked it open like she always does she was upset but didn’t hurt me (luckily) but I could’ve made one wrong move and she would’ve... in that moment I did really wish I told someone because I got really scared but after wards I couldn’t imagine telling anyone...(i know it isn’t but it just really feels embarrassing)


so I didn’t really know what to do people in the replies from last night told me to tell someone.. but I don’t really know who I’m gonna tell... some people said my teacher but my mom chose to make me stay home because of the virus so I don’t go to school... and telling them online just seems awkward and I can’t even imagine how they’d react.
Then some people said to tell my dad.. but he only comes and visits sometimes and sometimes I text him but he doesn’t read the messages cuz he didn’t get them he was supposed to visit today but didn’t show up..(butmy mom and him are calling and playing a game with my little brother rn while my older brother plays a games with his friend) 
And then some people said tell you’re social worker well... I’ve really seen multiple people and honestly those are all people from CPS or they work close to them and I always tell them everything’s fine so telling any of them is just..embarrassing or awkward for me I don’t know how to talk to people well.. I’m always worried what they think of me.. also even though I’ve seen them a couple of times over the years it almost feels like they’re strangers.. and whenever I see them my moms there... and I have literally no evidence at all to show that what I’m saying is true I have like one bruise that’s almost completely gone and you can barely see so now I’m worried about who to tell.. how to tell them.. whether they’re gonna believe me or not..and how they’re gonna react and what they’re gonna do if I tell them.....and also people have it worse than me... the last time she hurt me was a while ago would it really count......
I know everything I said probably sounds irrational like why don’t I just tell someone why am I being like this...

This is my first time posting in this sub, the mods from r/relationships sent me to you guys. Please forgive any irregularities. 

I recently moved back in with my parents. They fight. A lot. Nasty, screaming-match fights that can last for days. They had a child last year which has naturally created new tensions in the house, mostly because my stepfather contributes substantially less to childcare than my mother. It's obvious he loves the baby, but he often leaves my mother to do 70–90% of the grunt work (e.g. napping while she's in tears from back pain and needs help with the baby, spending hours at the gym/not adjusting any part of his pre-baby schedule, etc.) They are both currently unemployed and basically in the house together 24/7. To be honest it's clear that he's not equally contributing and it's grinding her down, but they don't communicate well at all and the whole situation is generating a lot of resentment. He is currently doing CBT therapy for anger management, which was a stipulation of an ultimatum my mother apparently gave him to avoid divorce. Couples therapy is not currently an option for insurance reasons.

A few months ago he purchased a rifle for home defense. I believe it's an AR-15. It is not in a safe. It stays beside their bed in the case it was purchased in. The other week, they got into an argument that ended with my stepdad storming out of the house. My mom broke down in front of me and admitted that he recently said to her ""I should shoot you in the fucking head"" while they were having a fight. Guys, I don't have the words to describe what hearing that felt like. It was a sickening, primal fear. My face must have given me away because she instantly regretted telling me, and spent the next half hour reassuring me that she felt completely safe and knew for a fact that he would never harm her. But what mother wouldn't?

My stepdad has never struck me as the violent type. He's a bit more confrontational than my mother and I, but I've always attributed that to his hailing from a more urban, crowded part of the country than us. I have always felt completely and totally safe around him. He has been in my life since I was a teenager, and I've come to view him as my true father, which only makes this worse. I feel guilty for the fears that I'm having. He has done so much for me, and has supported me in so many ways, and here I am, scared that he might harm my mom or my sibling or all of us. I will say that he is ex-military (non-combat) and ex-NFL, and we have suspected for some time that he may suffer from CTE.

I am physically ill with paranoia. They have been screaming most of the day, and with every lull in the argument I'm terrified that I will hear gunshots. I know this is very macabre, and it might just be my anxiety rearing its ugly head, but my quality of life has dropped significantly since this began. I don't have a big biological family. My mother and sibling are all I have, and if something were to happen to them, my life would be over. I just don't know what to do. My mom is financially dependent on him, and she does not have a degree. If I were to do anything that would remove either of them from this house, she and the baby (and myself) would be homeless and without any money. And although I feel horribly selfish even thinking about my own situation, this is really taxing me emotionally. I'm trying to get through college while also working part-time, and now I have this nightmarish anxiety always waiting for me at home. On top of that, I'm often left to care for the baby in a separate room while they fight. I can't do it all. It's eating me up.

My longterm boyfriend (24M) who, admittedly, is much more level-headed and much less anxious than I am, is trying to reassure me that my stepdad wouldn't hurt my mother. He thinks it was purely a heat of the moment anger that spilled out, and perhaps a result of my stepdad's military/police training. And really, I have never once felt unsafe around my stepfather until this happened. But I'm trying to look at the facts here, which are:

* There is a gun in the house that is in plain sight at all times, not in a safe.
* They are having bitter, drawn out fights every other week or so, often within the same space as the weapon.
* They are constantly in close proximity with little reprieve from one another.
* He has impulsively threatened to shoot her.
* It is possible that he has suffered brain injuries that can impact decision-making.
* Also a fact is that the best predictor of future behavior is past behavior, and my stepdad has never laid a hand on my mother (that I know of.)

What do I do? What *can* I do? What *should* I do? Am I overreacting? Any advice will be appreciated so much. 

TLDR; My stepdad threatened to shoot my mother in the head during a recent argument. He owns a gun which he doesn't keep locked up. They are having intense arguments several times a month, primarily surrounding tensions caused by my new baby sibling. He has never hurt me or my mother, and is by all accounts a kind person, but the paranoia is wearing me down. Neither my mother nor myself are in a position to leave the house, and I don't even know if that's something that should be considered.

Last night my boyfriend and father of my child raped me. It was my birthday. My first night out, baby with a sitter, for the first time in over a year. I got intoxicated and a took one single hit of weed. I was unable to walk, I had slurred speech, confusion, and I think I periodically passed out. My boyfriend was pretty much sober, however. 
He brought me to bed and I was laying on my back. At first I thought I was dreaming when I realized he wasn’t listening to me saying “no “ repeatedly. I used my arms to try and push him away. I said I don’t want this, I don’t know who you are, and even cried “rape” over and over. Nothing stopped him. I couldn’t believe he could be capable of this. I remember crying “no, not YOU! Not you not you!” Because I never imagined he was capable of this... 
This morning I woke up and sat up in disbelief. I wanted to believe it was a nightmare. But he woke up to. He seemed irritated and asked if I remember last night. I said I had a bad dream. He said it was real, that I kept crying rape, saying no, that I don’t know him. So there’s no doubt in my mind that this all happened. But I’m shocked that he so readily confessed to it like he doesn’t see a problem ?! He admits I was blacked out, didn’t want sex, cried rape, but he chose to continue anyway. I feel numb, scared, and confused. Just, why? Why would he do this? I feel betrayed, violated, and lost.",domesticviolence,My boyfriend raped me.

I need advice and your opinions/ and any personal experience you might have relating to my situation. I've {female 21 yr} been dating my boyfriend {male 20yrs} for about 2 years, its been up and down definitely toxic at times, but recently as we've both been going to therapy and getting help we have been better than ever. Some background on my boyfriend, his father is very abusive and has been his whole life, he still lives with his parents &amp; his environment at home is usually very toxic. Yesterday I was over at his parents house and we were watching a show in his room, his younger sister {shes 9 years old} came and watched it with us, my boyfriend fell asleep quickly so I let him be and am just enjoying the show with his little sister. As time passes its about 8pm, I decide to wake him up because I know that he won't be able to fall asleep later that night if he keeps napping. Hes probably been asleep for about an hour and a half maybe more, so I gently wake him &amp; hes pretty grumpy and annoyed. I explain to him that I just wanted him to be able to fall asleep later and that it was getting late. He's still half asleep and I let him be for a few mins- i lovingly put my head on his and nudge him a few times (I can see how that would be annoying but its out of love) he then gets very angry and raises his voice telling me to cut it out. I tell him I have to go soon and want to hangout with him before I go and I nudge him again. He rolls over facing me and backhands me in the face, it was hard. Sometimes we play rough but this was uncalled for and it really hurt. When he slapped me obviously his sister heard it and she put her hand on my face and said hes a meanie, but maybe she thought we were just playing around. A few seconds passed by and my boyfriend didn't do or say anything, I was furious like blood boiling angry and hurt. So I get up and go to the restroom worried I would cry in front of his sister. After I get my stuff I say I'm going home, I did not want to be there as it was only past 8pm my boyfriend and his sister are surprised because I usually stay later. I walk out and head to my car. My boyfriend has the audacity to ask why I'm leaving and I'm dumbfounded. I even say are you fucking kidding me you slapped me in the face &amp; you did it in front of your little sister? He says he doesn't REMEMBER slapping me and that it was on accident and points out that nothing like this has ever happened before. I keep my distance and don't say much after he gives his speech saying he's sorry and bs he tries to tell me to come inside. HELL no he asks for a hug and I say no thanks and I get in my car and leave. He has never hit me before, although his slap was hard it didn't cause damage to my face, but I feel so disrespected and that its a huuuuge red flag. He keeps saying he loves me, that he's sorry and that it was an accident. Am I stupid to believe him? Because part of me wants to and then my rational side kicks in and smells the bullshit. Should I leave him? I may have low self-worth but something like this I will not stand for or forgive. They say once your partner hits you most likely they will again and I'm afraid that if I don't leave that it will. Tell me your thoughts please, as this happened yesterday I am still coming to terms with everything. Is this considered abuse?

Physically, mentally, emotionally and financially. He’s currently facing 20 years because he tried to kill me. This was just under a year ago (we separated over a year ago) and, while I have come to terms with what happened, the emotional and physical scars still exist. I have been formally diagnosed with ptsd - the effects of which I am still learning to recognize and cope with. 

After I moved to a new city, found a job, my own place, got a dog and became settled I met and became friends with a man through work. After his relationship ended we started dating (it’s been almost 3 months). We were close when we were friends and are even closer now. 

He treats me well, he is kind to me and others, he helps the local community and is hard-working. Even so, I find myself sabotaging our relationship because of my past. I am easily triggered and I find ways to ‘hate’ him. I nit-pick his actions trying to somehow uncover his eventual abuse in some kind of “ta-da, gotcha” type way. 

People always say “trust your gut” but I don’t know what that looks like any more. I’m always second guessing myself to the point that it feels like I’m gaslighting....myself. I don’t trust him when I am triggered nor do I trust myself. I feel like I’m going crazy. 

I name-call (he does not) and yell (he does not). It’s like I have become the abuser because I am so used to having to constantly be on the defense. I don’t want to be this way, feel this way or treat him this way. I don’t want to be the reason our relationship fails. 

He is incredibly supportive and has said he will work to build my trust and to understand my triggers. I feel like such a burden and so pathetic - my need to feel strong and how I try to achieve that is my weakness.

first of all this is a throwaway for obvious reasons.

Since my Grandfather died
my Grandmother is being mentaly and physically abused by my uncle (her son).
She is currently staying at my house but wants to go back home because she misses home (I life about 1,5h away).
Her son has an apartment on his own but comes by her house regularly. He will threaten her and tell her shes worthless etc. And also hit her and push her around. Then wants my grandma to say sorry to him for making him angry.
My Grandmother defends him and says that he isn’t always like that. She just loves him too much to kick him out. 

Is there anyway I can help her ? I have been supporting her no matter what but she just seems to not recognise that shes being abused, since it has been increasing over time

I didn’t file a police report initially or report him (he’s active mil), but did get treated and injuries documented at the ER the day after it happened. 

The situation has been strange, he’s taken on a pattern of being verbally/financially/emotionally abusive now. 

Days ago I filed the police report and gave them all supporting documentation/photos/evidence. Unfortunately the detectives in Victim Advocacy at the substation I went to have a 30 day processing period before it’s even considered for prosecution by the DA—IF it even gets that far, due to the length of time that’s passed (approx 6 months).

I also filed for divorce but due to COVID, it’s taking more time for petitions to be filed and served. I filed back in Dec, but put  it on hold because I was a dumbass and thought counseling would help. 

One thing I’m curious about. My husband has a child from a previous marriage and another from a relationship between marriages where it was “one shot one kill.” He has unofficial primary custody of the child from his first marriage (mom didn’t want to mom so they reversed their possession periods and she sent her to live w/us during the school year). Their divorce decree was never changed to reflect this. Just a notarized letter. 

The child between marriages—he had no relationship with him and wasn’t present for the birth or for the first few years (he’s 3 and I just found out my husband met him for the first time last weekend—must be guilt). 

With our youngest, shared child, I fully intend to go to blows with him over this as he’s mentioned he doesn’t care if he goes broke doing so, he’d fight me for primary custody. If it doesn’t work in his favor, will it surface that he’s got domestic abuser status and will the court (or whomever) notify the other mothers?

I was 14 years old when we met, 15 when we started dating, 19 when we broke up, but 20 when things were officially over. The emotional abuse was present the entire time. He would get jealous of any and everybody I came in to contact with. This goes as deep as he got angry at me during my sisters graduation party because I hugged my older male cousin. I never had guy friends. My entire high school experience was spent providing for my boyfriend because his mother didn't give him much. I payed for everything, drove him everywhere, supported every single thing he did. The domestic abuse started when I was about 18. I don't know who hit first. But I do know that he did not hold back. Sometimes Id start the fight, sometimes he would, but I was always the one that left with bruises and scars. One day he hacked into my phone and deleted all the evidence I had against him. He had given me 2 black eyes, I had finger print bruises all over my arm, he broke my phone into shattered pieces in my dorm room, pushed me against the bed so hard my knee also has a scar. The only photo I have of the abuse is one of a tortilla sized bruise with a gash on my thigh that he gave me when he grabbed me so hard in a car then pushed me out of it in a gas station parking lot and abandoned me. That was the day we broke up. A year later (after much more emotional abuse in the time between) I decided to expose him to most of my friends for what he did to me. Apparently one of them said something to him and he made a lot of fake numbers to get in contact with me (I've since changed my number) but overall he did get in contact with me. He told me I was a liar and that I need to tell everyone the truth: Hes not an abuser and is a really sweet and nice guy. He made me feel horrible.

I would NEVER lie about domestic violence and especially not use my privilege for people to believe me. This abuse ACTUALLY HAPPENED to me and caused major trauma.

At first we didnt notice anything awry, but their relationship soon showed its true colors in a nasty way. Jane seems subdued and as if she's walking on eggshells around Tom, but has a completely different and more vibrant personality when she's on her own. Tom more and more has been berating Jane for the tiniest things in front of us and our other friends, sometimes embarrassing Jane to the point of tears. 

He claps at her to get her attention like an animal, and talks down to her constantly. Recently she had their first child, and things have definitely escalated with the stress of/control issues surrounding  their new baby. Sometimes we say something to refute what he's saying if he says something such as ""Jane, you're a bad mother"", we might respond ""Jane, I think youre doing a great job"".

However, Jane has confided in private that she'd prefer if we didnt say anything as it would only make it worse for her. She says she knows he was this way when she decided to marry him and she will put up with it. This is so worrying to me as, especially during the lockdown, who knows what she is having to put up with if he hasn't been able to hold it together just for the few times we've seen them in the past 6 months. 

Their child is certainly already being affected by the yelling and vitriol of their parent's relationship... she rarely sleeps, is colicky and seems ill at ease compared with other children the same age. It could be a coincidence for the time being, or a projection on my part, but there's no way this poor girl will remain unharmed.

He left without letting anyone know and when we would ask where he was he would say he was at the store. We all believed him because no one had eaten all day except for himself. Fast forward, because of the current situation we told him as a group we decided he should stay at his brothers since he could potentially have corona. He went ballistic and decided to come pick up his things in order to drive all the way back home. Even though we all (in exception for our friend who already lived in the area) came together in the new car. Through the phone he called me names and a friend who kind of knew about how he treats me hung up.
After a while after he came to pick up his things and yell at me from the balcony for the second time, I might add, I called him to make sure his drive was going smoothly. I told him he hurt our friends feelings after deciding to leave and continuously lie to them. He lost it. No lie. He started screaming at the top of his lungs, “YOURE A SNAKE! YOURE A SNAKE!

TELL ME AGAIN I HURT THEIR FEELINGS. TELL ME AGAIN. IM THE VICTIM NOT  YOU. ITS ME. ITS ALWAYS BEEN ME.” I started crying repeating no and no begging him to calm down. And then he hung up. 
A couple days ago he got mad at me because I started crying and decided to drive our car at 100 mph weaving through traffic. He then said “I wonder what would happen if I rammed this car into that bridge over there. What do you think babe?” I had to snap out of it and talk to him about my day in order to pretend everything was fine.

By all means it should have been a great trip. We went with my best friend from college and we got to see the northern lights.

However, there was a night that we left my friends behind and it was just me and him going in search of the northern lights. He got incredibly drunk, as per usual. He was driving us back to the hotel in our rental car and he was swerving a bit on this empty country road. I asked him to please pull over because I was scared and instead of pulling over, he drove faster and started swerving on purpose. I started screaming and threatened to jump out of the moving car. I even opened the door and was ready to jump until he pulled over. I ran outside and sat in the snow and refused to come back in. Dying from hypothermia was preferable to dying in a drunken crash.

I was driving when this memory hit me and I started panicking a bit. It felt so real, like I was there again.

We tried marriage counseling, and the counselor suggested I get a job because I'm depressed, exhausted and desperately need to interact with adults. I'm so lonely. Then covid-19 hit and there went my job searching. Im looking for one now but every one I mention to him he shits on and says I should just stay home. ""You would just get hit on anyways"" is what he says. Ridiculous.  

I had been on zoloft to treat my depression, but it caused me to lower my sex drive. That, coupled with the stress of raising 2 babies who REFUSED to sleep, you can imagine that part of our life stopped completely. He made get off completely. I didn't want to because it my life tolerable. I became depressed again and STILL didn't want sex. Over the weeks, maybe months, he coerced me into sex so many times after I clearly said no over and over. He even touched/penetrated me in my sleep. I have no idea how many times, I've only woken up to it twice. He let me drink one night, and he got drunk too. I was too drunk to do anything and he took advantage, even hit multiple times and had bruises the next day. 

Fast forward to this month, I had started seeing a counselor, to help me through my depression and stress. I told her how exhausted I was, and suggested I need to get out of the house at least 4-6 hours a week. I talked to my husband about what she said, and he immediately attacked me. ""well what about me? You are just gonna go out and drink and find someone else"" I told him no, I was planning on going out and joining a protest with my sister, Id forgotten how passionate I am my community and being involved. He lets me go. But not without a fight. ""Why are you putting makeup on? You never do that for me!"" Yes I do. ""Why are you brushing your teeth, plan on kissing someone?"" Apparently hygiene equals cheating. It goes on until I leave. I come back and he digs through my pockets and finds my lipgloss. ""What do you need this for? It's flavored!"" It's the only lip gloss I own. ""Are you seriously saying I'm cheating because I wore lipgloss?"" He responded ""if the shoe fits!"" 

Today I was going through my Google drive and found old pics of me and my friend when she was modeling that I had pretty much forgotten about. They are from 4 years ago, some are ""promiscuous"" as in they show my butt (kinda). I'm going through them and thought he would get a laugh at how dumb and terrible they were. He flips a switch and immediately starts attacking me accusing me of hiding them from him because ""you knew I would never approve of you doing THAT!"" But back then I did show them to him, they were horrible and I only saved like 3 of them. He knew about the photoshoot. I never hid anything from him. ""You did hide them from me, and makes me wonder what else you're hiding!"" I couldn't take the accusations anymore, I said im going to my moms to drop off my sister (she witnessed everything and has seen/heard much more in past arguments). I go upstairs to put on a bra and he follows me. ""What do you need a bra for? What are you really going to?"" Why am I not allowed to wear a bra now? What the fuck? 

There's hundreds of incidents like this, the fights last for hours, sometimes days. I feel like im leaving so much out, but I cant make this post too long.

In the car with my sister, she tells me I need to get out NOW. That what he's doing is abusive but it hasn't really occurred to me.

I was scared shitless. I didn't quite know what happened and i tried to process it but couldn't. And then yesterday, while my mom was home with me, we heard screams and cries and bangs so loud i jumped from my chair. We looked through the peep hole and i saw the same woman with the addict guy. She was running up and down the stairs, again obviously high, screaming that he was hitting her and that he took her phone so she couldn't call the police. She was ringing neighbours doorbells but no one opened because we were all so frightened. My mom said she was afraid one of them will end up dead. That lasted for over an hour. In the end she went back to the apartment with him. I felt so bad for not helping her, but i know they are both addicts and i was afraid one of them would hurt me or my mom.

So she first started by standing on me when she thought I was pregnant even though I was just twelve back then (a few months ago) and I had no boyfriend and it was just and irregular period (she didn’t even let me take the test) 
But then after wards she started doing stuff like trying to stab me with scissors, chasing me trough the house with knives, threatening to kill me, forcing me to take 3 strips of birth control....cause she thought I was pregnant and we are already involved with cps (they don’t know about this) and she doesn’t want my brothers (and apparently me) to get taken away from her.. 
she was also diagnosed with psychosis a few years ago.. so she kinda has this weird story that’s she keeps on saying, that’s kinda like she thinks people can read her mind , if she sees anything on internet she pretends it’s aimed directly at her and says people are bullying her (it doesn’t even have to be bad) so once I heard yelling from downstairs and then she came to my door mad and kept on telling me to open it I was scared so I kept on saying stuff to stall like “why?” “I don’t want to if ur gonna hurt me...” she ended up kicking the door open and strangling me...
She’s hit me with a broom/mop stick before 
A piece of wood (it broke, but she used the excuse that it was already breaking even though I’m sure it wasn’t) etc.
But it’s like sometimes she’s like that and other times she’s acting as if she loves me...
Like around two weeks ago is the last time she hurt me, my school changed the transportation for school and said that someone would drive the students that live far away (including me) but then changed it again and said that wasn’t gonna happen she got mad and started blaming me for it and went into my room yelling for me to call my homeroom teacher I was looking at her cuz other wise she’d probably find it disrespectful but at the same time hoping that she didn’t think I was rolling my eyes cuz she often says that I’m rolling my eyes at her when all I’m doing is just looking at her this time was no different she thought I was rolling my eyes and hit me with a plate she aimed for my head but I blocked it with my arm I got a bruise but it wasn’t that visible and I got a wound (kinda looking like a dot of blood but at the same time it wasn’t bleeding) she continued yelling at me.... 
but now around two weeks later she hasn’t hit me since then (she has insulted me once again for things I couldn’t possibly control) but today she apologized after asking why I wasn’t that close with her and seemed to be “unhappy with her” so I mentioned the fact that she strangled me and she blamed it on me said it was my fault cuz I did (once again something I couldn’t possibly control) anyway later she came to my room and just said she wanted to make up with me.. so she said just sorry and kept on talking my door was closed but she kept asking for me to open it.. eventually I got kinda tired of hearing the same thing over and over again so I opened my door cuz I knew she probably wasn’t gonna go away.. she kinda hugged me all happy like a little child when she said something like yay or yes she forgives me or something like that.. but idk she could start hurting me at anytime again.. also even if she doesn’t am I supposed to just let it go as if it never happened in the first place I feel like I’m being over dramatic for not just letting it go.. and even though she did all that a lot I barely got any bruises so was it really that bad? Also would anyone even believe me if I tell them with zero evidence... it’s not like I have nightmares or something.. sometimes I do think she’s gonna hit me again and I flinch but that’s really all....... 

(TL;DR: so my mom with psychosis started “disciplining”(for stuff I couldn’t control) (and threatening to kill me) me a while ago but the last time she did it was a few weeks ago and she apologized today, she could do it anytime again but could also not.. do idk what to do...btw I’m a 13 girl with two brothers..and my dad lives in another city he’s coming to visit tomorrow tho..(before This she acted abusive towards my stepdad (who would never hurt her btw) but he committed... a few years ago also I don’t live in the US so the rules might be a bit different here)",domesticviolence,So I kinda need advice (I also posted this on another subreddit),https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/h8flm2/so_i_kinda_need_advice_i_also_posted_this_on/,True

(Some background information: I’m transgender female-to-male and had been struggling a long time with my sexuality)

I dated a guy (we’ll call him Michael) for 11 months. I knew going into the relationship that he identified as asexual and I was fine with that. A little while into the relationship, Michael told me that he was a survivor of sexual assault and had PTSD. He told me his triggers, and I made sure to avoid them at all costs. A few months into the relationship, Michael expressed that he was interested in trying sexual things with me. We went slow — I made sure I never pressured him to do anything he didn’t want to, I avoided his triggers, and frequently checked to see if everything was alright. Everything was going fine — sometimes he’d get upset or overwhelmed, but we’d stop immediately and I’d always be there to comfort him. Eventually he got a lot more comfortable with sex so it happened more often. Then the end of the semester came (we’re both in college), and he began getting really stressed. 

He was in crisis just about every day. I tried to be there for him whenever he was upset, but it was becoming extremely taxing on me and my own mental health. It got to the point that I couldn’t take it anymore, so I told him I was feeling extremely emotionally worn out and asked him to find someone else to talk to about his issues. He apologized, but he didn’t stop. In fact, it got worse. The smallest thing could send him into deep self loathing to the point that I was extremely afraid of saying anything that might set him off. He had hurt himself in front of me before, so I was always afraid of what he might do if I spoke up about how basically being his therapist was affecting me.

Needless to say, I was more than relieved when summer cam around and I could go back to my home all the way across the country. Over the summer, I finally started passing as male. I also started to realize that I didn’t feel comfortable with the romantic side of my relationship with Michael and came out to him as aromantic. He agreed to stop doing very overtly romantic things in order to make me more comfortable. However, he didn’t stop — he kept doing things that I was uncomfortable with, becoming inconsolable when I’d confront him, and telling me that it was his depression/PTSD that was making it hard for him to remember. I figured that I couldn’t be angry with him since it was his mental illness and was beyond his control, so I just sucked it up and didn’t say anything about it again. 

Summer ended and I went back to school for the fall. A month or two later, I realized I was also very uncomfortable with the sexual side of our relationship as well and ended up I coming out to him as asexual. We agreed that we’d have more of a dedicated partnership than a romantic relationship and that we wouldn’t do anything else sexual because I told him I was extremely uncomfortable with it. 

But again, even though he was a sexual assault survivor who was always pushing consent, he didn’t stop sexual advances. It would start gradually enough that I wouldn’t realize until it was too late (for example, we’d be laying down with each other in bed and suddenly I’d realize his hands were where I didn’t want them to be). At this point, I wanted to say no, but then I’d remember how he had banged his head against the wall as self-punishment and thought he didn’t deserve to live for forgetting to turn on the fan above the stove — what would he do if I told him he had done something sexual to me without his consent? Or implied that he had done the same thing that the person who assaulted him did? He had told me from the beginning of the relationship that that was his greatest fear. 

So, afraid of what he might do to himself if I spoke up, I just let it happen. I’d even comfort him afterwards when he’d get upset and tell me that he hadn’t even wanted to do it. It made absolutely no sense to me since I had asked for us to stop doing sexual things for an indefinite amount of time and now here I was, having to comfort him after he had gone ahead with sex anyways and then claimed he never wanted to do it in the first place. This happened a few times, and I blamed myself for having somehow probably pressured him — why else would he have done it? He was asexual after all, right? Anyways, I ended up breaking up with him after winter break when I realized that I wasn’t aromantic or asexual, I just liked women instead of men (at one point in my life liking women was considered gay since I was living as a girl, so bad reactions from others had pushed me to believe I was bisexual). 

I blocked Michael on every social media platform I could think of, but ended up confronting him through tumblr messaging, telling him what he had done to me and the damage it had caused. He replied by saying “I was trapped in my worst memories, and it made it hard to remember where I was, who I was with, what was talked about”. 

Now I’m trying to figure out how much he can really be held accountable for what he did. On one hand, he created an environment where saying no could be dangerous and he also initiated sex after I had withdrawn consent indefinitely. On the other hand, he had severe mental health issues. I’m struggling to figure out if I’m allowed to put the blame on him and how much his mental health issues made it so that it really wasn’t his fault. 

So basically, is he still to blame even if his mental health issues made him forget all those things? Or is it even possible that depression, PTSD, or OCD can make you forget things like that? (For context, he was still able to do fine in classes and didn’t seem extremely mentally impaired)",domesticviolence,Do I even have the right to be mad?

There was at time I felt safe with you by my side, there weren't many but this one I will carry always. See, people ask me why did you stay with him through all of that. That isn't an easy thing to explain to those who've never experienced violence and gas-lighting to the extent of diminishment of self. 
I guess I held onto that moment for deeper than I should have, perhaps because it was the only glisten of humanity I saw, even though it was for yourself. 
I was in labour with our son, far earlier than what doctors decide is viable life. We were in the hospital watching the clock, timing. You were there by my side. You were holding me telling me everything was going to be okay. You were my rock when I needed it the most. I know now that you didn't do it for me. That was an act for you and your observers because we both know that in their notes, your actions were the reason we were there.

When I look back, it is so blatantly clear. You were the hunter, I was your prey.

You used my fears and my secrets I confided to you, to chip away at my self, to wear me down and groom me into a drudge you controlled.

At every glisten of me you would suppress, with your words, your hands, and your prick. Every action, every utterance you did, stripped another layer from my spirit, what it was to be me, to live.

I couldn't see it then, I believed your lies that something must be wrong with me, though I see it now. Through your demons you battered me until who I was, was gone.

You had this power of forging me into believing everything you said, that I deserved it, that I was stupid, that I was worthless if not for that act you used against me, that I was fucked in the head.

You stripped me, in all ways, back to my bones. I had become nothing other than a shell and your slave. Even then though it wasn't good enough, you had taken away my family, my friends, marked my sanity and deprived my dignity. You still wanted more, so that Wednesday in May, you took my light too.

I was resigned. I had succumbed to your whim, this was all I am for the rest of my life until you decide my body was expendable too. I mattered no more and just waited for my death at your hands. When that didn't come (yet), you lost the control. I got out.

No longer could your words, or your fists or that grip on my wrist make me do what you wanted.

You couldn't bear people knowing all that you had done, how dare I tell. So you took that fear you induced, you took that pain you caused, you took my secrets I shared and tried to spread them in shame. You told the world trauma you inflicted on me was made up in my mind, you fought against onus and still do to this day, in your words by your postings ""I will win"".

Oh but honey, this isn't a game.

I know that in reading this, if you are ever compelled to, it probably turns you on. A small list of your achievements, you won't read this as ever having done anything wrong.
Though this isn't that. I'm not asking for recognition nor is it a gift of forgiveness, no. You don't deserve a place of peace in my heart and I don't care to give it because I am not afraid, I've already lived in hell.

I want you to know that in fact, in some way, I am grateful. See, without being completely broken I wouldn't have been able to build up. I couldn't have breathed without feeling safe, I couldn't have smiled without feeling happiness deep, I couldn't have felt without knowing strength. If not for all the torture you forced me through, I couldn't have become who I am today, proud, strong, brave and unashamed.

I did that.

You are nothing without triumph of my defeat. I am everything you don't want in me, and everything you wish people thought you could be.

I stand tall through the trauma, and the venom you spit. I'm unwavering in your last battle to make me quit because thanks to you, I have nothing to fear.
You have a lifetime of self vindicating, a lifetime of justifying incidences you won't admit but I, I have light and I have power, I own my shit.

Some people in the replies kinda warned me that she’d probably do it again.. today I got scared and thought she would so this morning she got really mad because she found my older brothers keys outside and they’ve been there since yesterday she got really upset and said that anyone could’ve entered our house she started yelling at my brother who also got really mad and said that he wasn’t the one that left the keys there she said that they were his keys and he was responsible for it and he quickly tried to blame me for leaving the keys outside but I have my own keys and didn’t use his and he knows that but still started hitting and kicking my door trying to open it and threatening me all because he was tryna but my moms attention and the blame on me so he wouldn’t be yelled at or blamed for it then my mom came upstairs and he went to his room upset and then my mom started hitting and kicking my door (and blaming me for stuff that didn’t happen and I couldn’t control that also had nothing to do with the situation) I got scared because it reminded me of all the times she did that wich always led to her hurting me eventually she kicked it open like she always does she was upset but didn’t hurt me (luckily) but I could’ve made one wrong move and she would’ve... in that moment I did really wish I told someone because I got really scared but after wards I couldn’t imagine telling anyone...(i know it isn’t but it just really feels embarrassing)


so I didn’t really know what to do people in the replies from last night told me to tell someone.. but I don’t really know who I’m gonna tell... some people said my teacher but my mom chose to make me stay home because of the virus so I don’t go to school... and telling them online just seems awkward and I can’t even imagine how they’d react.
Then some people said to tell my dad.. but he only comes and visits sometimes and sometimes I text him but he doesn’t read the messages cuz he didn’t get them he was supposed to visit today but didn’t show up..(butmy mom and him are calling and playing a game with my little brother rn while my older brother plays a games with his friend) 
And then some people said tell you’re social worker well... I’ve really seen multiple people and honestly those are all people from CPS or they work close to them and I always tell them everything’s fine so telling any of them is just..embarrassing or awkward for me I don’t know how to talk to people well.. I’m always worried what they think of me.. also even though I’ve seen them a couple of times over the years it almost feels like they’re strangers.. and whenever I see them my moms there... and I have literally no evidence at all to show that what I’m saying is true I have like one bruise that’s almost completely gone and you can barely see so now I’m worried about who to tell.. how to tell them.. whether they’re gonna believe me or not..and how they’re gonna react and what they’re gonna do if I tell them.....and also people have it worse than me... the last time she hurt me was a while ago would it really count......
I know everything I said probably sounds irrational like why don’t I just tell someone why am I being like this...

To summarise, my housemate ('Alex') was escalating their behaviour of hitting, throwing stuff at me, and aggressive behaviour.

I moved out on Monday, and my housemate only caught me during my second trip and Alex asked if we could have a 'chat' and I said no.

I've since been told that Alex 'would like it if I contacted them directly as Alex would like to be able to discuss and resolve any problems which have occurred within your friendship' by a mutual friend (who doesn't know the details of the abuse).

Do I message Alex?

I was thinking along the lines of 'I understand you probably want an explanation as to why I moved out. Your behaviour when you are upset (I have personally witnessed/been on the receiving end of verbal abuse, throwing things, hitting, slapping, screaming, and more) is abusive and terrifying. When you confronted me with an issue you had out of the blue, you made me fear for my safety. I could not confront you, because it was not safe to. I left because I need to be safe.

first of all this is a throwaway for obvious reasons.

Since my Grandfather died
my Grandmother is being mentaly and physically abused by my uncle (her son).
She is currently staying at my house but wants to go back home because she misses home (I life about 1,5h away).
Her son has an apartment on his own but comes by her house regularly. He will threaten her and tell her shes worthless etc. And also hit her and push her around. Then wants my grandma to say sorry to him for making him angry.
My Grandmother defends him and says that he isn’t always like that. She just loves him too much to kick him out. 

Is there anyway I can help her ? I have been supporting her no matter what but she just seems to not recognise that shes being abused, since it has been increasing over time

I didn’t file a police report initially or report him (he’s active mil), but did get treated and injuries documented at the ER the day after it happened. 

The situation has been strange, he’s taken on a pattern of being verbally/financially/emotionally abusive now. 

Days ago I filed the police report and gave them all supporting documentation/photos/evidence. Unfortunately the detectives in Victim Advocacy at the substation I went to have a 30 day processing period before it’s even considered for prosecution by the DA—IF it even gets that far, due to the length of time that’s passed (approx 6 months).

I also filed for divorce but due to COVID, it’s taking more time for petitions to be filed and served. I filed back in Dec, but put  it on hold because I was a dumbass and thought counseling would help. 

One thing I’m curious about. My husband has a child from a previous marriage and another from a relationship between marriages where it was “one shot one kill.” He has unofficial primary custody of the child from his first marriage (mom didn’t want to mom so they reversed their possession periods and she sent her to live w/us during the school year). Their divorce decree was never changed to reflect this. Just a notarized letter. 

The child between marriages—he had no relationship with him and wasn’t present for the birth or for the first few years (he’s 3 and I just found out my husband met him for the first time last weekend—must be guilt). 

With our youngest, shared child, I fully intend to go to blows with him over this as he’s mentioned he doesn’t care if he goes broke doing so, he’d fight me for primary custody. If it doesn’t work in his favor, will it surface that he’s got domestic abuser status and will the court (or whomever) notify the other mothers?

I was 14 years old when we met, 15 when we started dating, 19 when we broke up, but 20 when things were officially over. The emotional abuse was present the entire time. He would get jealous of any and everybody I came in to contact with. This goes as deep as he got angry at me during my sisters graduation party because I hugged my older male cousin. I never had guy friends. My entire high school experience was spent providing for my boyfriend because his mother didn't give him much. I payed for everything, drove him everywhere, supported every single thing he did. The domestic abuse started when I was about 18. I don't know who hit first. But I do know that he did not hold back. Sometimes Id start the fight, sometimes he would, but I was always the one that left with bruises and scars. One day he hacked into my phone and deleted all the evidence I had against him. He had given me 2 black eyes, I had finger print bruises all over my arm, he broke my phone into shattered pieces in my dorm room, pushed me against the bed so hard my knee also has a scar. The only photo I have of the abuse is one of a tortilla sized bruise with a gash on my thigh that he gave me when he grabbed me so hard in a car then pushed me out of it in a gas station parking lot and abandoned me. That was the day we broke up. A year later (after much more emotional abuse in the time between) I decided to expose him to most of my friends for what he did to me. Apparently one of them said something to him and he made a lot of fake numbers to get in contact with me (I've since changed my number) but overall he did get in contact with me. He told me I was a liar and that I need to tell everyone the truth: Hes not an abuser and is a really sweet and nice guy. He made me feel horrible. He made me feel like I ruined his life for speaking about my experiences. He told me I'm disgusting and just a white girl who wants to ruin a black males life which I would NEVER do. I would NEVER lie about domestic violence and especially not use my privilege for people to believe me. This abuse ACTUALLY HAPPENED to me and caused major trauma. Am I wrong for telling people what happened to me? Am I a horrible person?

At first we didnt notice anything awry, but their relationship soon showed its true colors in a nasty way. Jane seems subdued and as if she's walking on eggshells around Tom, but has a completely different and more vibrant personality when she's on her own. Tom more and more has been berating Jane for the tiniest things in front of us and our other friends, sometimes embarrassing Jane to the point of tears. 

He claps at her to get her attention like an animal, and talks down to her constantly. Recently she had their first child, and things have definitely escalated with the stress of/control issues surrounding  their new baby. Sometimes we say something to refute what he's saying if he says something such as ""Jane, you're a bad mother"", we might respond ""Jane, I think youre doing a great job"".

However, Jane has confided in private that she'd prefer if we didnt say anything as it would only make it worse for her. She says she knows he was this way when she decided to marry him and she will put up with it. This is so worrying to me as, especially during the lockdown, who knows what she is having to put up with if he hasn't been able to hold it together just for the few times we've seen them in the past 6 months. 

Their child is certainly already being affected by the yelling and vitriol of their parent's relationship... she rarely sleeps, is colicky and seems ill at ease compared with other children the same age. It could be a coincidence for the time being, or a projection on my part, but there's no way this poor girl will remain unharmed.

Recently Tom started talking about how he throws and breaks things and has outbursts of rage frequently at home directed at Jane.

A couple days ago my friends, myself and boyfriend went out of town together in our new car. While there, he decided to go visit his SICK brother who lives 1-2 hours away. He left without letting anyone know and when we would ask where he was he would say he was at the store. We all believed him because no one had eaten all day except for himself. Fast forward, because of the current situation we told him as a group we decided he should stay at his brothers since he could potentially have corona. He went ballistic and decided to come pick up his things in order to drive all the way back home. Even though we all (in exception for our friend who already lived in the area) came together in the new car. Through the phone he called me names and a friend who kind of knew about how he treats me hung up.
After a while after he came to pick up his things and yell at me from the balcony for the second time, I might add, I called him to make sure his drive was going smoothly. I told him he hurt our friends feelings after deciding to leave and continuously lie to them. He lost it. No lie. He started screaming at the top of his lungs, “YOURE A SNAKE! YOURE A SNAKE!

TELL ME AGAIN I HURT THEIR FEELINGS. TELL ME AGAIN. IM THE VICTIM NOT  YOU. ITS ME. ITS ALWAYS BEEN ME.” I started crying repeating no and no begging him to calm down. And then he hung up. 
A couple days ago he got mad at me because I started crying and decided to drive our car at 100 mph weaving through traffic. He then said “I wonder what would happen if I rammed this car into that bridge over there. What do you think babe?” I had to snap out of it and talk to him about my day in order to pretend everything was fine. 
After talking with our friends, we came to the conclusion he has either DID or schizo since he hears voices all the time which tell him to “get rid of her (me).” He has even chocked me during intimacy. I’m in constant fear he will either hurt me or himself.

He is an alcoholic, and while he wasn't physically and sexually abusive until the very end of the relationship back in August, he was often emotionally and psychologically abusive.

Yesterday it rained where I was. The weather was quite weird for where we are and the sky was a dark cloudy grey. The weather reminded me of this trip that we took to Alaska together. By all means it should have been a great trip. We went with my best friend from college and we got to see the northern lights.

However, there was a night that we left my friends behind and it was just me and him going in search of the northern lights. He got incredibly drunk, as per usual. He was driving us back to the hotel in our rental car and he was swerving a bit on this empty country road. I asked him to please pull over because I was scared and instead of pulling over, he drove faster and started swerving on purpose. I started screaming and threatened to jump out of the moving car. I even opened the door and was ready to jump until he pulled over. I ran outside and sat in the snow and refused to come back in. Dying from hypothermia was preferable to dying in a drunken crash.

I was driving when this memory hit me and I started panicking a bit. It felt so real, like I was there again.

I have a history of being sexually assaulted, depression and suicidal thoughts and attempts. My (24f) husband (26m) and I have been together 5 years, got engaged and had 2 children. We were married in march. He's always been extremely jealous and controlling, but I felt pressure to stay work things out (yeah I know stupid me). 

This year things have gotten so much worse. Im a stay at home mom, I never leave the house because he either doesn't want to watch the kids or doesn't think its fair because he doesn't have any friends. I try to encourage him to make plans with someone but he wont. He always tells me how much he hates my friends because they drink and he doesn't want me to drink too. I've gone to a bar twice in the last 3 years and I hardly ever drink at home. 

We tried marriage counseling, and the counselor suggested I get a job because I'm depressed, exhausted and desperately need to interact with adults. I'm so lonely. Then covid-19 hit and there went my job searching. Im looking for one now but every one I mention to him he shits on and says I should just stay home. ""You would just get hit on anyways"" is what he says. Ridiculous.  

I had been on zoloft to treat my depression, but it caused me to lower my sex drive. That, coupled with the stress of raising 2 babies who REFUSED to sleep, you can imagine that part of our life stopped completely. He made get off completely. I didn't want to because it my life tolerable. I became depressed again and STILL didn't want sex. Over the weeks, maybe months, he coerced me into sex so many times after I clearly said no over and over. He even touched/penetrated me in my sleep. I have no idea how many times, I've only woken up to it twice. He let me drink one night, and he got drunk too. I was too drunk to do anything and he took advantage, even hit multiple times and had bruises the next day. 

Fast forward to this month, I had started seeing a counselor, to help me through my depression and stress. I told her how exhausted I was, and suggested I need to get out of the house at least 4-6 hours a week. I talked to my husband about what she said, and he immediately attacked me. ""well what about me? You are just gonna go out and drink and find someone else"" I told him no, I was planning on going out and joining a protest with my sister, Id forgotten how passionate I am my community and being involved. He lets me go. But not without a fight. ""Why are you putting makeup on? You never do that for me!"" Yes I do. ""Why are you brushing your teeth, plan on kissing someone?"" Apparently hygiene equals cheating. It goes on until I leave. I come back and he digs through my pockets and finds my lipgloss. ""What do you need this for? It's flavored!"" It's the only lip gloss I own. ""Are you seriously saying I'm cheating because I wore lipgloss?"" He responded ""if the shoe fits!"" 

Today I was going through my Google drive and found old pics of me and my friend when she was modeling that I had pretty much forgotten about. They are from 4 years ago, some are ""promiscuous"" as in they show my butt (kinda). I'm going through them and thought he would get a laugh at how dumb and terrible they were. He flips a switch and immediately starts attacking me accusing me of hiding them from him because ""you knew I would never approve of you doing THAT!"" But back then I did show them to him, they were horrible and I only saved like 3 of them. He knew about the photoshoot. I never hid anything from him. ""You did hide them from me, and makes me wonder what else you're hiding!"" I couldn't take the accusations anymore, I said im going to my moms to drop off my sister (she witnessed everything and has seen/heard much more in past arguments). I go upstairs to put on a bra and he follows me. ""What do you need a bra for? What are you really going to?"" Why am I not allowed to wear a bra now? What the fuck?

I was scared shitless. I didn't quite know what happened and i tried to process it but couldn't. And then yesterday, while my mom was home with me, we heard screams and cries and bangs so loud i jumped from my chair. We looked through the peep hole and i saw the same woman with the addict guy. She was running up and down the stairs, again obviously high, screaming that he was hitting her and that he took her phone so she couldn't call the police. She was ringing neighbours doorbells but no one opened because we were all so frightened. My mom said she was afraid one of them will end up dead. That lasted for over an hour. In the end she went back to the apartment with him. I felt so bad for not helping her, but i know they are both addicts and i was afraid one of them would hurt me or my mom. What should i do the next time something like this happens? I'm also afraid to call the police because they would probably arrest them both because of drugs, and that i would do more harm to her than good.",domesticviolence,I need advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/h8d365/i_need_advice/,True

So she first started by standing on me when she thought I was pregnant even though I was just twelve back then (a few months ago) and I had no boyfriend and it was just and irregular period (she didn’t even let me take the test) 
But then after wards she started doing stuff like trying to stab me with scissors, chasing me trough the house with knives, threatening to kill me, forcing me to take 3 strips of birth control....cause she thought I was pregnant and we are already involved with cps (they don’t know about this) and she doesn’t want my brothers (and apparently me) to get taken away from her.. 
she was also diagnosed with psychosis a few years ago.. so she kinda has this weird story that’s she keeps on saying, that’s kinda like she thinks people can read her mind , if she sees anything on internet she pretends it’s aimed directly at her and says people are bullying her (it doesn’t even have to be bad) so once I heard yelling from downstairs and then she came to my door mad and kept on telling me to open it I was scared so I kept on saying stuff to stall like “why?” “I don’t want to if ur gonna hurt me...” she ended up kicking the door open and strangling me...
She’s hit me with a broom/mop stick before 
A piece of wood (it broke, but she used the excuse that it was already breaking even though I’m sure it wasn’t) etc.
But it’s like sometimes she’s like that and other times she’s acting as if she loves me...
Like around two weeks ago is the last time she hurt me, my school changed the transportation for school and said that someone would drive the students that live far away (including me) but then changed it again and said that wasn’t gonna happen she got mad and started blaming me for it and went into my room yelling for me to call my homeroom teacher I was looking at her cuz other wise she’d probably find it disrespectful but at the same time hoping that she didn’t think I was rolling my eyes cuz she often says that I’m rolling my eyes at her when all I’m doing is just looking at her this time was no different she thought I was rolling my eyes and hit me with a plate she aimed for my head but I blocked it with my arm I got a bruise but it wasn’t that visible and I got a wound (kinda looking like a dot of blood but at the same time it wasn’t bleeding) she continued yelling at me.... 
but now around two weeks later she hasn’t hit me since then (she has insulted me once again for things I couldn’t possibly control) but today she apologized after asking why I wasn’t that close with her and seemed to be “unhappy with her” so I mentioned the fact that she strangled me and she blamed it on me said it was my fault cuz I did (once again something I couldn’t possibly control) anyway later she came to my room and just said she wanted to make up with me.. so she said just sorry and kept on talking my door was closed but she kept asking for me to open it.. eventually I got kinda tired of hearing the same thing over and over again so I opened my door cuz I knew she probably wasn’t gonna go away.. she kinda hugged me all happy like a little child when she said something like yay or yes she forgives me or something like that.. but idk she could start hurting me at anytime again.. also even if she doesn’t am I supposed to just let it go as if it never happened in the first place I feel like I’m being over dramatic for not just letting it go.. and even though she did all that a lot I barely got any bruises so was it really that bad? Also would anyone even believe me if I tell them with zero evidence... it’s not like I have nightmares or something.. sometimes I do think she’s gonna hit me again and I flinch but that’s really all....... 

(TL;DR: so my mom with psychosis started “disciplining”(for stuff I couldn’t control) (and threatening to kill me) me a while ago but the last time she did it was a few weeks ago and she apologized today, she could do it anytime again but could also not.. do idk what to do...btw I’m a 13 girl with two brothers..and my dad lives in another city he’s coming to visit tomorrow tho..(before This she acted abusive towards my stepdad (who would never hurt her btw) but he committed... a few years ago also I don’t live in the US so the rules might be a bit different here)",domesticviolence,So I kinda need advice (I also posted this on another subreddit),https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/h8flm2/so_i_kinda_need_advice_i_also_posted_this_on/,True

Here’s some examples:

He brought me to a bank and had me sign a paper with a legit notary “promising to give away my unborn child”. This was against my will. The only reason I did it was so he’d give me a ride to the airport so I could leave his ass. He Harassed me all summer to give away the baby before I “corrupted it” (while I was still pregnant) THEN he tried to use this notarized paper against me in a custody dispute. Claiming to be dad of the year. (Now he’s an absent parent)

Here’s another fun one. He got me intoxicated, allowed his friend to sexually assault me. Convinced me I’d consented to it. And then a year later allowed the same friend to MOVE INTO OUR FUCKING HOUSE against my consent. And literally made me feel GUILTY because I understandably didn’t want his friend living there.... Then in front of me and this friend, he commented that he would be ok with allowing other men to have sex with me as long as he was in the room.  Like what the actual f^%%

One last one: He got me to drop out of nursing school, so I’d be able to move away with him. So I did what he said. Once we moved away I switched majors. He proceeded to try and tell me that I was a failure for dropping out of nursing school. And that my new major was worthless and I should’ve asked permission first.

Rest is just details explaining the type of abuse and problems my brother has caused.

&amp;#x200B;

Hey everyone,

For starters, this is a throwaway account for obvious reasons, but I'm wanting to ask the internet for some serious advice that my family may not be able to come up with ourselves. It's going to be a pretty lengthy and detail-saturated post, but it's probably best I lay it all out there to really understand the entire picture and what kind of person my brother is.

My brother (38), who lives with my dad (74), has not physically harmed my dad yet, but the possibility keeps increasing with time. What he has done though, is caused a tremendous amount of psychological stress and financial damage.

I want my dad to stop living in fear. His life honestly is not good right now, and it could be if my brother weren't in the picture. I ask for any advice in which my family can use to remove my brother from our lives, or at the very least, my dad's house.

I unfortunately live about an hour half from my dad, and my other brother lives about 30 min, but still it's too far in case there's an emergency. My dad sorta makes matters worse by protecting my brother and covering for him sometimes. He just wants peace and nothing else so he tries to sit on the fence and pretend things are fine, but other times he admits he wishes he was gone.

&amp;#x200B;

# Summary:

My brother has had consistent drug and/or mental relapses, which include several physical assaults, verbal assaults, years of jail time, and even death threats against my dad. He shows no signs or ability to reason with anyone or anything, and recently his mental state has decayed so much I don't even consider him a functional adult any longer. He's been basically unemployed for about 10 or more years now living off my dad's income.  He's basically just a hollow shell that nobody wants to be around in fear that something might trigger him. He's potentially very dangerous and at his best, he's still an enormous financial strain and source of stress.

He's had a very up-and-down life since he was 16. He's always been a pretty big troublemaker, but around 18 he was prescribed painkillers (Vicodin) for an injury he sustained. This led him down a never ending road of substance abuse. He was a functional adult back then, but just had an addiction that we all felt he could get past. The entire family was always supportive of him getting clean, but his recoveries always led to a relapse. Each time we all kept encouraging him to get better, and to try again. We were very sympathetic for him. We truly were on his side.

Unfortunately his life never had any stability in it. We believe he's gotten to a point now that he will never change. Sadly his mind just seems to be gone now from all the drugs he's done (he's admitted to mixing pills, using heroine, and a litany of methods to get high that I never heard of. There's nothing left of him that resemble the ""good"" parts of him. Now days he rambles about religion 24/7 as he's become a fanatic, and complains no one loves Jesus as much as he does and how everyone is a fake christian (even entire churches), he confuses being high with feeling the holy spirit etc. Just very unusual behavior all the time that it's just his new normal. Basically he's so unhinged lately, that he's become even more unpredictable, and that scares us.

Nobody really knows for sure if my brother has a mental disorder, has fried his brain, or is just constantly under the influence. My brother never shares doctor information, and the doctors he claims he goes to all sound fake/sketchy so I don't know the validity of anything he tells us. It doesn't help that my dad obfuscates details in his older age a lot more than he used to so we're going to only work with the information I can confirm from my own experiences or through my other brother.

There's so many incidents he's caused, I don't think I can confidently recall them all so I'll just categorize each type of incident and list the most memorable and you can read or skip ahead as you please.

&amp;#x200B;

# Car accidents:

I think he's wrecked about 6 vehicles? Maybe more? A few were ""his"" that my dad bought him, and the rest were my parents' personal vehicles. Amazingly, he hasn't harmed or killed anyone in any of his car accidents, mainly because he doesn't make it very far from his origin and crashes all by himself due to being so inebriated. All vehicles were totaled.

He's wrapped a truck around a mailbox while drunk driving.

* Flipped my mom's Trailblazer after jumping a driveway culvert and landing on a neighbors fence.
* Flipped my mom's Suburban after going into a ditch off the side of the road.
* Yelled at my mom from the passenger seat, where she became so stressed out and accidentally drove her car through their brick garage wall (everyone was okay).
* Caused a 3+ car pile up at a traffic light where he failed to stop. He got injured pretty good, but nothing serious.

His most recent wreck (early this year) and the biggest aftermath, was right after he quit his job of one week and claimed Jesus told him to ""turn the wheel right"" while on the highway. He swerved into the right-side guardrail until coming to a stop where a good Samaritan stopped to assist. My brother then attacks the man until police show up and he attacks the officer as well. It was later discovered he had shoplifted a bunch of clothes. He was arrested obviously. He was in jail for about a month, but eventually was released and showed up back at my dad's.

One of my biggest concerns here is not himself, but the safety of other drivers on the road. I fear he will get someone killed eventually. Nobody feels like they can simply take keys away from him, either. My dad begs to keep peace, and I fear he will take his anger out on my dad in a physical way when no one is there to step in. It seems like we lose any decision we make.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# Financial Burdens:

Before my mom passed away in 2016, she for the most part, kept my brother in check with her motherly presence. Since then though, my brother has only gotten worse. He was always more tolerable with my mom, but now that he directly has to deal with my dad more often, he is a lot more aggressive.

My dad is too ...nice, afraid, guilty...whatever you want to call it to simply evict my brother. Everyone knows that if he were to kick him out, his reaction would be unpredictable. Ranging anywhere from my brother getting himself killed in a car accident, overdose, violent encounter with someone, or my brother would simply not comply and remain in the house and use physical force if he had to. All of these possibilities make it hard for my dad to make a decision on what to do. Here's some facts about my brother regarding financial burdens:

* He can't hold a job. He occasionally gets a decent job but will blow it in about a month and blames the employer. I can't keep track of how many times he's been fired. He hardly looks for work, and will only consider work positions that aren't beneath him, thus he rarely gets hired anywhere. Over the last decade, he's mostly spent his time sitting at home or fishing with the use of my dad and his (now former) girlfriend's money.
* He was looking to buy a car, but when the salesman ""offended"" him, he pretended to be a bigshot and took his business across the street and literally bought a \~$70k truck that he 9000% can't afford. Somehow my dad ended up making the $700 dollar payments for him. (this is the truck that is now totaled after ""Jesus"" told him to crash it).
* He is currently a patient of a methadone clinic, and I don't know the details but I'm to understand it's not cheap.
* He receives money from my dad to go buy chewing tobacco whenever he runs out
* Just today I found out my brother stole my dad's credit card, stole my dad's car, bought himself a new phone, venmo'd himself $500 and for some reason called 911 and told the dispatcher my dad was having a heart attack and was showing signs of dementia (He wasn't and he isn't). Luckily the paramedics didn't fine my dad or anything.
* He eats a huge amount of food and it's causing my dad to have to grocery shop more often to keep the kitchen stocked.
* He generally breaks household items on accident a lot and my dad has to replace them.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# Acts of aggression:

All of these acts of aggression are him being under the influence of ""something"". When he's sober, he's typically a normal person. He comes across like a tough guy still, but generally doesn't act nearly a irrational. He doesn't drink since his teenage days really, so we can only assume he is mixing pills. When he's ""high"" he just becomes very dopey in behavior. His voice becomes lower, slower and his eyes look sleepy. However, he is at his most sensitive in this stage and feels like everyone is constantly judging him, but he reacts with aggression, mostly getting in peoples faces, spitting, headbutting, yelling etc.

I just want to be clear that nobody provokes him ever. He is 100% the bully in all situations. Every case is the same where he will take offense to something as minor as disagreeing with him on what temperature to set the oven, or telling him to give you a little space while he speaks, because he's getting spit on your face.

It'd be impossible to list every time he's verbally abused someone or made some threats, but some notable events are:

* Received a phone call in 2013 from my mom saying she and my dad were locked in their bedroom and he was trying to break the door down to get to them.
* Headbutt me sometime around 2012 to make me fight him when I was angry with him for being high and incoherently rambling to me.
* Several instances with my other brother where they got into fist-fights because he was acting belligerent and insulting my mom, and he didn't appreciate being confronted.
* Ex-friend of my brother confided this year that my brother told him he would kill my dad if my dad did not keep paying my brothers truck payments.
* I already mentioned he recently attacked a good Samaritan and police officer this year.
* Not an aggressive act, but several times he's gone schizophrenic and claimed crazy things like our nephews were inside his washing machine and sobbing that he couldn't get them out. This particular incident was around 2008 or 2009 and we later found out he mixed his methadone with other pills that caused him to hallucinate.

When he's not being hotheaded and looking to start a fight with someone, he generally is so doped out that he could pass out and fall asleep in the middle of the kitchen floor or just sleeping in his room. When he sleeps is when everyone can escape the insanity for a little bit.

&amp;#x200B;

# Conclusion:

I know some responses will be tempted to provide drug addiction help, but please try to keep in mind my family's priority is to keep my dad safe first. If my brother can be helped, then that's great, but we've all given him literally every chance to redeem himself, get help, etc  and I don't want my dad to live with him another minute if possible. He has proven time after time that he does not want any help. He is overflowing with confidence and actually thinks very highly of himself. He's convinced himself that he is superior in every way and any misfortune he's had is just the world pushing down good people.

We keep hoping he'll get arrested again and go away for an actual long time, but somehow the longest he's ever stayed in jail was a little over a year. He's a good faker when he knows he needs to be, so he knows how to fool people into thinking he's ""functional"" enough. First impression of him from the perspective of a complete stranger, and you'd just think he's a really strange guy who seems kinda toxic, but doesn't technically cross any lines.

This has been the most frustrating part. What he's doing should be illegal, but the police don't seem to care that an abusive family member can intimidate his way into being a lifelong leech on his own father. Please, please let us know if there's some program or anything out there that can help us out.

my Grandmother is being mentaly and physically abused by my uncle (her son).
She is currently staying at my house but wants to go back home because she misses home (I life about 1,5h away).
Her son has an apartment on his own but comes by her house regularly. He will threaten her and tell her shes worthless etc. And also hit her and push her around. Then wants my grandma to say sorry to him for making him angry.
My Grandmother defends him and says that he isn’t always like that. She just loves him too much to kick him out.

I didn’t file a police report initially or report him (he’s active mil), but did get treated and injuries documented at the ER the day after it happened. 

The situation has been strange, he’s taken on a pattern of being verbally/financially/emotionally abusive now. 

Days ago I filed the police report and gave them all supporting documentation/photos/evidence. Unfortunately the detectives in Victim Advocacy at the substation I went to have a 30 day processing period before it’s even considered for prosecution by the DA—IF it even gets that far, due to the length of time that’s passed (approx 6 months).

I also filed for divorce but due to COVID, it’s taking more time for petitions to be filed and served. I filed back in Dec, but put  it on hold because I was a dumbass and thought counseling would help. 

One thing I’m curious about. My husband has a child from a previous marriage and another from a relationship between marriages where it was “one shot one kill.” He has unofficial primary custody of the child from his first marriage (mom didn’t want to mom so they reversed their possession periods and she sent her to live w/us during the school year). Their divorce decree was never changed to reflect this. Just a notarized letter. 

The child between marriages—he had no relationship with him and wasn’t present for the birth or for the first few years (he’s 3 and I just found out my husband met him for the first time last weekend—must be guilt). 

With our youngest, shared child, I fully intend to go to blows with him over this as he’s mentioned he doesn’t care if he goes broke doing so, he’d fight me for primary custody. If it doesn’t work in his favor, will it surface that he’s got domestic abuser status and will the court (or whomever) notify the other mothers? I’m sorry if it’s a stupid question and if it’s been asked before. Thanks in advance.",domesticviolence,What if?,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/h79gpk/what_if/,True

I was 14 years old when we met, 15 when we started dating, 19 when we broke up, but 20 when things were officially over. The emotional abuse was present the entire time. He would get jealous of any and everybody I came in to contact with. This goes as deep as he got angry at me during my sisters graduation party because I hugged my older male cousin. I never had guy friends. My entire high school experience was spent providing for my boyfriend because his mother didn't give him much. I payed for everything, drove him everywhere, supported every single thing he did. The domestic abuse started when I was about 18. I don't know who hit first. But I do know that he did not hold back. Sometimes Id start the fight, sometimes he would, but I was always the one that left with bruises and scars. One day he hacked into my phone and deleted all the evidence I had against him. He had given me 2 black eyes, I had finger print bruises all over my arm, he broke my phone into shattered pieces in my dorm room, pushed me against the bed so hard my knee also has a scar. The only photo I have of the abuse is one of a tortilla sized bruise with a gash on my thigh that he gave me when he grabbed me so hard in a car then pushed me out of it in a gas station parking lot and abandoned me. That was the day we broke up. A year later (after much more emotional abuse in the time between) I decided to expose him to most of my friends for what he did to me. Apparently one of them said something to him and he made a lot of fake numbers to get in contact with me (I've since changed my number) but overall he did get in contact with me. He told me I was a liar and that I need to tell everyone the truth: Hes not an abuser and is a really sweet and nice guy. He made me feel horrible. He made me feel like I ruined his life for speaking about my experiences. He told me I'm disgusting and just a white girl who wants to ruin a black males life which I would NEVER do. I would NEVER lie about domestic violence and especially not use my privilege for people to believe me. This abuse ACTUALLY HAPPENED to me and caused major trauma. Am I wrong for telling people what happened to me? Am I a horrible person?

At first we didnt notice anything awry, but their relationship soon showed its true colors in a nasty way. Jane seems subdued and as if she's walking on eggshells around Tom, but has a completely different and more vibrant personality when she's on her own. Tom more and more has been berating Jane for the tiniest things in front of us and our other friends, sometimes embarrassing Jane to the point of tears. 

He claps at her to get her attention like an animal, and talks down to her constantly. Recently she had their first child, and things have definitely escalated with the stress of/control issues surrounding  their new baby. Sometimes we say something to refute what he's saying if he says something such as ""Jane, you're a bad mother"", we might respond ""Jane, I think youre doing a great job"".

However, Jane has confided in private that she'd prefer if we didnt say anything as it would only make it worse for her. She says she knows he was this way when she decided to marry him and she will put up with it. This is so worrying to me as, especially during the lockdown, who knows what she is having to put up with if he hasn't been able to hold it together just for the few times we've seen them in the past 6 months. 

Their child is certainly already being affected by the yelling and vitriol of their parent's relationship... she rarely sleeps, is colicky and seems ill at ease compared with other children the same age. It could be a coincidence for the time being, or a projection on my part, but there's no way this poor girl will remain unharmed.

Recently Tom started talking about how he throws and breaks things and has outbursts of rage frequently at home directed at Jane. And a couple weeks ago he got out of his car to threaten another driver in a fit of road rage. Obviously this escalation is extremely concerning for Jane, so I am going to speak to her safely away from Tom on Monday.

A couple days ago my friends, myself and boyfriend went out of town together in our new car. While there, he decided to go visit his SICK brother who lives 1-2 hours away. He left without letting anyone know and when we would ask where he was he would say he was at the store. We all believed him because no one had eaten all day except for himself. Fast forward, because of the current situation we told him as a group we decided he should stay at his brothers since he could potentially have corona. He went ballistic and decided to come pick up his things in order to drive all the way back home. Even though we all (in exception for our friend who already lived in the area) came together in the new car. Through the phone he called me names and a friend who kind of knew about how he treats me hung up.
After a while after he came to pick up his things and yell at me from the balcony for the second time, I might add, I called him to make sure his drive was going smoothly. I told him he hurt our friends feelings after deciding to leave and continuously lie to them. He lost it. No lie. He started screaming at the top of his lungs, “YOURE A SNAKE! YOURE A SNAKE! I KNOW HOW YOU WORK. YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO HELP ME FIX THINGS, YOU COULDVE STOPPED THIS FROM HAPPENING. I HURTY OUR FRIENDS? LET ME RAM THIS CAR INTO A WALL AND THEN I CAN REALLY HURT THEIR FEELINGS. TELL ME AGAIN I HURT THEIR FEELINGS. TELL ME AGAIN. IM THE VICTIM NOT  YOU. ITS ME. ITS ALWAYS BEEN ME.” I started crying repeating no and no begging him to calm down. And then he hung up. 
A couple days ago he got mad at me because I started crying and decided to drive our car at 100 mph weaving through traffic. He then said “I wonder what would happen if I rammed this car into that bridge over there. What do you think babe?” I had to snap out of it and talk to him about my day in order to pretend everything was fine. 
After talking with our friends, we came to the conclusion he has either DID or schizo since he hears voices all the time which tell him to “get rid of her (me).” He has even chocked me during intimacy. I’m in constant fear he will either hurt me or himself.

He is an alcoholic, and while he wasn't physically and sexually abusive until the very end of the relationship back in August, he was often emotionally and psychologically abusive.

Yesterday it rained where I was. The weather was quite weird for where we are and the sky was a dark cloudy grey. The weather reminded me of this trip that we took to Alaska together. By all means it should have been a great trip. We went with my best friend from college and we got to see the northern lights.

However, there was a night that we left my friends behind and it was just me and him going in search of the northern lights. He got incredibly drunk, as per usual. He was driving us back to the hotel in our rental car and he was swerving a bit on this empty country road. I asked him to please pull over because I was scared and instead of pulling over, he drove faster and started swerving on purpose. I started screaming and threatened to jump out of the moving car. I even opened the door and was ready to jump until he pulled over. I ran outside and sat in the snow and refused to come back in. Dying from hypothermia was preferable to dying in a drunken crash.

I was driving when this memory hit me and I started panicking a bit. It felt so real, like I was there again.

I got to my current boyfriend's place and told him all about it and how scared I was. My current boyfriend is an angel and accepts me even though I have all these problems.

After 5 years together, and 4+ years of dealing with physical, emotional, and financial abuse, I am done. I have made a plan to move in with my cousin. Her and my best friend are the only two who have any idea what is going on in my relationship. Our lease begins the first week of July, and my god am i ready for my freedom.

Funnily enough (in a very morbid way) after I came back from the hospital today so get a sling around my arm because he tore my shoulder muscle from slamming me to the ground the other day, I got the call. “I’ve made the deposit, we move in the first week of July” I cried right there on the sidewalk. After years of abuse I’m going to be free.

My escape plan however, needs the kinks worked out. Due to the current world situation, im currently unemployed and he is working from home. I planned to leave and take my animals (all registered under my name and my name alone) when he was gone, but i now have no idea when that will happen. He has random parts hanging around the house that he’s trying to sell, i was honestly considering hiring someone in the ny/nj area to buy the part off of him and offer extra for him to drive to ship it to them so i can make my escape while he is gone. I’ve also contacted my bank to remove myself as an authorized used on our shared cc. Also our lease was up last year and we have been paying month to month so no problems there as well.

I know there is so much more that I need to do before leaving but I just want to make sure I do everything I can to keep him from finding me because I legitimately think he’ll try to kill me when he finds out. My dad is still paying for my phone while im in college so my abuser has no access to the account. I plan to change my phone number as well and tell all my fanily not to respond to any of his attempts to contact them.

Another issue is that we also go to the same university, we are both set to graduate next year. But since I am going through with this I wouldn’t feel safe at my university and plan on taking the year off. Not only for safety, but I’m going to need some serious mental health guidance after this, my grades are already in the toilet because of it so I need a break.

Other than the shared card, there’s no other money I owe him or have tied up with him anywhere.

I will first provide information about the urgent situation, and provide background information further down in the post.

I currently live in the US. My dad and mom live in Singapore with my younger brother who is in high school. My Dad has been abusive towards my mother for a long time; mostly emotionally and verbally, but has recently been physically abusive as well. My dad recently sold our house in Singapore, and put half the money from the sale into my mom's account, and my family has moved apartments a few times since.

Today he sent her a message saying that she had to transfer all the money to his account by the end of the day, and to send him her bank statements since Jan 2020. There was no explicit threat, but it is strongly implied by the history of abuse. My mom has reached out to a counsellor, who said that she needs to come in to the office in person to register for a case worker. My mom is afraid that if my dad finds out she's reached out to a counsellor, he will get violent. She is currently working from home, so is locked in her room and cannot leave until evening, after work, which is after the counsellor's office closes. We're afraid of what might happen at the end of the day if she's still at home and hasn't transferred the money (which she doesn't want to do for reasons explained below). She has reached out to the counsellor about the situation, but has not yet received a response.

She can go to my uncle's (mom's brother) house, which is where she's gone when things have gotten bad in the past. But she usually views this as a last-resort option as she doesn't like to burden her brother. She also doesn't usually leave the house during the day, so if she checks out of work and leaves to go to the counsellor's office, my dad will know something is up, and my mom doesn't like to leave my brother alone with him when he's angry.

What is the best course of action here? I understand that the laws in Singapore may be different from the laws in the US or wherever you're from, but any advice or insight is appreciated. I personally have no idea what to tell her, and feel guilty that I don't know what to do.

P.S. I have crossposted this to other subs. Please let me know if there is anywhere else I can post this to get some advice

\------

In the current apartment, my mom's monthly salary is equal to the monthly rent. My dad makes 4 times what my mom does (because she took many years off work to raise my brother and me, and is now above the age of 50). My dad refused to pay for the rent a couple of months last year. When my mom explains that she cannot cover the rent herself because she does not earn enough, he because EXTREMELY vile and abusive, and sometimes physically so. He calls her a leech (among other things), and asks her why she can't just go earn more. He also refuses to pay for anything else except for my brother's school tuition, but the rent is the biggest burden on my mom.

My mom thinks he is doing this to wipe out all of the money in her account, which would allow him to control her completely. She doesn't want to let go of it because it's all she has, and doesn't want to live with my dad after my brother graduates high school (also we don't know if he's going to pay for my brother's college. I'm a PhD student so I don't make nearly enough to support anyone).

In January of this year, my dad agreed to pay the 80% of the rent. He did so until March, and has not paid rent since. My mom only found out about this a couple of days ago from our landlord. She confronted him about this, but he again became abusive. The lease in solely in my mom's name. She has paid the rent for April, May, and June, but the money in her account is starting to drop very fast.

My dad is very weird about money. He's always trying some pseudo get-rich-quick scheme like property flipping or options trading, but he's lost a lot of money on these ventures because he has no idea what he's doing. When he gets stressed about money, he becomes abusive. He is also an alcoholic, and becomes more abusive when he's drunk. My mom is very afraid of my dad, especially when he's angry and **especially** when he's drunk. My 14 year-old brother once had to push my dad away from my mom when he was drunk and abusing her physically. She spends most of the time at home locked in her room, and this is exacerbated by the current lockdown.

My mom is reluctant to call the cops on him because she thinks it will negatively affect my brother's life, and she thinks keeping the family unit together even if only in name is worth the trauma. We are also reluctant to call the cops on him because my mom does not make enough money to afford to pay for an apartment and my brother's tuition, and still have enough money to send him to college. My aforementioned uncle is semi-wealthy and has been very generous with lending us money when we've needed it in the past, so I'm sure he will at least help, but my mom doesn't want to burden him. My uncle is the only other family we have in Singapore because we are originally from India.

I'm not sure how much evidence we have against him. I (and hopefully my brother) will vehemently testify against him about the abuse, and so will my uncle. My mother probably has chat logs of abuse on Whatsapp. I've asked her to download a voice recording app, and start recording when she thinks he is going to get abusive. I have screenshots of some of his browsing history, which is not great viewing but probably not illegal. He also tried to cheat on my mom in the past with someone from Canada (probably a catfish), and some of our extended family know about that. We have a lot of testimony against him, but not much concrete evidence of the abuse.",domesticviolence,Dad is threatening my Mom if she doesn't transfer all her money to him today,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/gzgcqw/dad_is_threatening_my_mom_if_she_doesnt_transfer/,True

For nearly two years now I have been buried beneath the insecurity and jealousy that had consumed me after my boyfriend had beat me outdoors in broad daylight. I’ve been on here a handful of times looking for strength and support only to wake up the next morning and call him myself. 

The jealousy comes from knowing that in his previous relationship he had never laid a hand on her. I would consistently pry as you why he was able to hurt me but not his ex. I feel like an evil person almost wishing that it had been something all his exes were exposed to, but deep down if there is any clarity or sense left in my brain I am thankful that harm never came to her - it just makes me feel as if there is something I had done to deserve it. 

I’ve left him tonight. Not because he had hurt me again but because as time continued I noticed that I became more resentful that he was now treating me kindly with respect and tenderness AFTER completely burning all of the bridges from him to my family/friends and hurting me. We had decided upon the last incident of physical abuse that he would no longer drink because he had been aggressive with me whenever he was drunk. Sometimes I lay at night and question what is compelling me to stay with a man who I would not be able to trust under the influence of alcohol, that I am fearful to drink with because I am doing all in my power to avoid a chokehold at the end of the night. 

I’ve been surrounded by my friends tonight. They have been talking to me on the phone up until I was convinced that I am tired - but once I am alone the flood of loneliness and desperation has began to sit in.

I only have a part time job. I’m trying to find some type of rental assistance so I can move. When I came home from work last night, I saw all the boxes in my room. They weren’t even neatly placed. He told me before I have two months to move (that’s when the lease ends). I yelled because I asked him earlier in the day if he could put my stuff back where he found it. Yet he just put all my stuff in the boxes in the middle of the room. We got into an argument and in the middle of it, he gets in my face and yells “do you want me to hit you?” I think it was the adrenaline because I said “do it and I’ll call my family and 911.” This doesn’t even make sense because my family is on the other side of the country. Yet it was the only thing I could think of. He then got his phone to record me. I said “my husband just threatened to hit me and I told him I’ll call 911 if he does.” He stopped recording after that. Eventually, I just started sobbing and it hit me that my husband threatened to hit me. I told him and he blamed me. He said I was blocking him (I honestly don’t remember doing that but he can easily push me aside if I was) and that I had spittle coming out of my mouth. I’m pretty sure he’s trying to make me seem crazy to his fiancé. He called her after. 

I don’t feel safe yet I feel I’m blowing this out of proportion. I wanted to leave but thought “there’s no where to go.” I went back to my room to try to sleep. I feel exhausted. I’m not sure what to do. I don’t want to talk to my family or friends about this. Like I don’t want anyone to overreact. I guess I just needed to talk to someone, even strangers on the Internet about this.

Here’s some examples:

He brought me to a bank and had me sign a paper with a legit notary “promising to give away my unborn child”. This was against my will. The only reason I did it was so he’d give me a ride to the airport so I could leave his ass. He Harassed me all summer to give away the baby before I “corrupted it” (while I was still pregnant) THEN he tried to use this notarized paper against me in a custody dispute. Claiming to be dad of the year. (Now he’s an absent parent)

Here’s another fun one. He got me intoxicated, allowed his friend to sexually assault me. Convinced me I’d consented to it. And then a year later allowed the same friend to MOVE INTO OUR FUCKING HOUSE against my consent. And literally made me feel GUILTY because I understandably didn’t want his friend living there.... Then in front of me and this friend, he commented that he would be ok with allowing other men to have sex with me as long as he was in the room.  Like what the actual f^%%

One last one: He got me to drop out of nursing school, so I’d be able to move away with him. So I did what he said. Once we moved away I switched majors. He proceeded to try and tell me that I was a failure for dropping out of nursing school. And that my new major was worthless and I should’ve asked permission first.

Rest is just details explaining the type of abuse and problems my brother has caused.

&amp;#x200B;

Hey everyone,

For starters, this is a throwaway account for obvious reasons, but I'm wanting to ask the internet for some serious advice that my family may not be able to come up with ourselves. It's going to be a pretty lengthy and detail-saturated post, but it's probably best I lay it all out there to really understand the entire picture and what kind of person my brother is.

My brother (38), who lives with my dad (74), has not physically harmed my dad yet, but the possibility keeps increasing with time. What he has done though, is caused a tremendous amount of psychological stress and financial damage.

I want my dad to stop living in fear. His life honestly is not good right now, and it could be if my brother weren't in the picture. I ask for any advice in which my family can use to remove my brother from our lives, or at the very least, my dad's house.

I unfortunately live about an hour half from my dad, and my other brother lives about 30 min, but still it's too far in case there's an emergency. My dad sorta makes matters worse by protecting my brother and covering for him sometimes. He just wants peace and nothing else so he tries to sit on the fence and pretend things are fine, but other times he admits he wishes he was gone.

&amp;#x200B;

# Summary:

My brother has had consistent drug and/or mental relapses, which include several physical assaults, verbal assaults, years of jail time, and even death threats against my dad. He shows no signs or ability to reason with anyone or anything, and recently his mental state has decayed so much I don't even consider him a functional adult any longer. He's been basically unemployed for about 10 or more years now living off my dad's income.  He's basically just a hollow shell that nobody wants to be around in fear that something might trigger him. He's potentially very dangerous and at his best, he's still an enormous financial strain and source of stress.

He's had a very up-and-down life since he was 16. He's always been a pretty big troublemaker, but around 18 he was prescribed painkillers (Vicodin) for an injury he sustained. This led him down a never ending road of substance abuse. He was a functional adult back then, but just had an addiction that we all felt he could get past. The entire family was always supportive of him getting clean, but his recoveries always led to a relapse. Each time we all kept encouraging him to get better, and to try again. We were very sympathetic for him. We truly were on his side.

Unfortunately his life never had any stability in it. We believe he's gotten to a point now that he will never change. Sadly his mind just seems to be gone now from all the drugs he's done (he's admitted to mixing pills, using heroine, and a litany of methods to get high that I never heard of. There's nothing left of him that resemble the ""good"" parts of him. Now days he rambles about religion 24/7 as he's become a fanatic, and complains no one loves Jesus as much as he does and how everyone is a fake christian (even entire churches), he confuses being high with feeling the holy spirit etc. Just very unusual behavior all the time that it's just his new normal. Basically he's so unhinged lately, that he's become even more unpredictable, and that scares us.

Nobody really knows for sure if my brother has a mental disorder, has fried his brain, or is just constantly under the influence. My brother never shares doctor information, and the doctors he claims he goes to all sound fake/sketchy so I don't know the validity of anything he tells us. It doesn't help that my dad obfuscates details in his older age a lot more than he used to so we're going to only work with the information I can confirm from my own experiences or through my other brother.

There's so many incidents he's caused, I don't think I can confidently recall them all so I'll just categorize each type of incident and list the most memorable and you can read or skip ahead as you please.

&amp;#x200B;

# Car accidents:

I think he's wrecked about 6 vehicles? Maybe more? A few were ""his"" that my dad bought him, and the rest were my parents' personal vehicles. Amazingly, he hasn't harmed or killed anyone in any of his car accidents, mainly because he doesn't make it very far from his origin and crashes all by himself due to being so inebriated. All vehicles were totaled.

He's wrapped a truck around a mailbox while drunk driving.

* Flipped my mom's Trailblazer after jumping a driveway culvert and landing on a neighbors fence.
* Flipped my mom's Suburban after going into a ditch off the side of the road.
* Yelled at my mom from the passenger seat, where she became so stressed out and accidentally drove her car through their brick garage wall (everyone was okay).
* Caused a 3+ car pile up at a traffic light where he failed to stop. He got injured pretty good, but nothing serious.

His most recent wreck (early this year) and the biggest aftermath, was right after he quit his job of one week and claimed Jesus told him to ""turn the wheel right"" while on the highway. He swerved into the right-side guardrail until coming to a stop where a good Samaritan stopped to assist. My brother then attacks the man until police show up and he attacks the officer as well. It was later discovered he had shoplifted a bunch of clothes. He was arrested obviously. He was in jail for about a month, but eventually was released and showed up back at my dad's.

One of my biggest concerns here is not himself, but the safety of other drivers on the road. I fear he will get someone killed eventually. Nobody feels like they can simply take keys away from him, either. My dad begs to keep peace, and I fear he will take his anger out on my dad in a physical way when no one is there to step in. It seems like we lose any decision we make.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# Financial Burdens:

Before my mom passed away in 2016, she for the most part, kept my brother in check with her motherly presence. Since then though, my brother has only gotten worse. He was always more tolerable with my mom, but now that he directly has to deal with my dad more often, he is a lot more aggressive.

My dad is too ...nice, afraid, guilty...whatever you want to call it to simply evict my brother. Everyone knows that if he were to kick him out, his reaction would be unpredictable. Ranging anywhere from my brother getting himself killed in a car accident, overdose, violent encounter with someone, or my brother would simply not comply and remain in the house and use physical force if he had to. All of these possibilities make it hard for my dad to make a decision on what to do. Here's some facts about my brother regarding financial burdens:

* He can't hold a job. He occasionally gets a decent job but will blow it in about a month and blames the employer. I can't keep track of how many times he's been fired. He hardly looks for work, and will only consider work positions that aren't beneath him, thus he rarely gets hired anywhere. Over the last decade, he's mostly spent his time sitting at home or fishing with the use of my dad and his (now former) girlfriend's money.
* He was looking to buy a car, but when the salesman ""offended"" him, he pretended to be a bigshot and took his business across the street and literally bought a \~$70k truck that he 9000% can't afford. Somehow my dad ended up making the $700 dollar payments for him. (this is the truck that is now totaled after ""Jesus"" told him to crash it).
* He is currently a patient of a methadone clinic, and I don't know the details but I'm to understand it's not cheap.
* He receives money from my dad to go buy chewing tobacco whenever he runs out
* Just today I found out my brother stole my dad's credit card, stole my dad's car, bought himself a new phone, venmo'd himself $500 and for some reason called 911 and told the dispatcher my dad was having a heart attack and was showing signs of dementia (He wasn't and he isn't). Luckily the paramedics didn't fine my dad or anything.
* He eats a huge amount of food and it's causing my dad to have to grocery shop more often to keep the kitchen stocked.
* He generally breaks household items on accident a lot and my dad has to replace them.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# Acts of aggression:

All of these acts of aggression are him being under the influence of ""something"". When he's sober, he's typically a normal person. He comes across like a tough guy still, but generally doesn't act nearly a irrational. He doesn't drink since his teenage days really, so we can only assume he is mixing pills. When he's ""high"" he just becomes very dopey in behavior. His voice becomes lower, slower and his eyes look sleepy. However, he is at his most sensitive in this stage and feels like everyone is constantly judging him, but he reacts with aggression, mostly getting in peoples faces, spitting, headbutting, yelling etc.

I just want to be clear that nobody provokes him ever. He is 100% the bully in all situations. Every case is the same where he will take offense to something as minor as disagreeing with him on what temperature to set the oven, or telling him to give you a little space while he speaks, because he's getting spit on your face.

It'd be impossible to list every time he's verbally abused someone or made some threats, but some notable events are:

* Received a phone call in 2013 from my mom saying she and my dad were locked in their bedroom and he was trying to break the door down to get to them.
* Headbutt me sometime around 2012 to make me fight him when I was angry with him for being high and incoherently rambling to me.
* Several instances with my other brother where they got into fist-fights because he was acting belligerent and insulting my mom, and he didn't appreciate being confronted.
* Ex-friend of my brother confided this year that my brother told him he would kill my dad if my dad did not keep paying my brothers truck payments.
* I already mentioned he recently attacked a good Samaritan and police officer this year.
* Not an aggressive act, but several times he's gone schizophrenic and claimed crazy things like our nephews were inside his washing machine and sobbing that he couldn't get them out. This particular incident was around 2008 or 2009 and we later found out he mixed his methadone with other pills that caused him to hallucinate.

When he's not being hotheaded and looking to start a fight with someone, he generally is so doped out that he could pass out and fall asleep in the middle of the kitchen floor or just sleeping in his room. When he sleeps is when everyone can escape the insanity for a little bit.

&amp;#x200B;

# Conclusion:

I know some responses will be tempted to provide drug addiction help, but please try to keep in mind my family's priority is to keep my dad safe first. If my brother can be helped, then that's great, but we've all given him literally every chance to redeem himself, get help, etc  and I don't want my dad to live with him another minute if possible. He has proven time after time that he does not want any help. He is overflowing with confidence and actually thinks very highly of himself. He's convinced himself that he is superior in every way and any misfortune he's had is just the world pushing down good people.

We keep hoping he'll get arrested again and go away for an actual long time, but somehow the longest he's ever stayed in jail was a little over a year. He's a good faker when he knows he needs to be, so he knows how to fool people into thinking he's ""functional"" enough. First impression of him from the perspective of a complete stranger, and you'd just think he's a really strange guy who seems kinda toxic, but doesn't technically cross any lines.

This has been the most frustrating part. What he's doing should be illegal, but the police don't seem to care that an abusive family member can intimidate his way into being a lifelong leech on his own father. Please, please let us know if there's some program or anything out there that can help us out.

I didn’t file a police report initially or report him (he’s active mil), but did get treated and injuries documented at the ER the day after it happened. 

The situation has been strange, he’s taken on a pattern of being verbally/financially/emotionally abusive now. 

Days ago I filed the police report and gave them all supporting documentation/photos/evidence. Unfortunately the detectives in Victim Advocacy at the substation I went to have a 30 day processing period before it’s even considered for prosecution by the DA—IF it even gets that far, due to the length of time that’s passed (approx 6 months).

I also filed for divorce but due to COVID, it’s taking more time for petitions to be filed and served. I filed back in Dec, but put  it on hold because I was a dumbass and thought counseling would help. 

One thing I’m curious about. My husband has a child from a previous marriage and another from a relationship between marriages where it was “one shot one kill.” He has unofficial primary custody of the child from his first marriage (mom didn’t want to mom so they reversed their possession periods and she sent her to live w/us during the school year). Their divorce decree was never changed to reflect this. Just a notarized letter. 

The child between marriages—he had no relationship with him and wasn’t present for the birth or for the first few years (he’s 3 and I just found out my husband met him for the first time last weekend—must be guilt). 

With our youngest, shared child, I fully intend to go to blows with him over this as he’s mentioned he doesn’t care if he goes broke doing so, he’d fight me for primary custody. If it doesn’t work in his favor, will it surface that he’s got domestic abuser status and will the court (or whomever) notify the other mothers?

This is my first and only boyfriend in my 25 years of life. In the beginning everything was beautiful and I felt so loved but then things changed. A year and a half into the relationship I found out my bf would masturbate to pictures of his girl best friends and even to pictures of his sister in laws. I asked him to stop since he was so close to them and even asked him to stop hanging out with them if he saw them in any way other then as friends. He told me he felt nothing for them and what he was doing was normal and had no emotional connection. He said he didn’t even want to have real sex with them. I began to get jealous and insecure so I would check his phone often and realized he continued to do it. I didn’t leave him because that was my first bf and felt like I loved him. One day he got annoyed that I kept asking him to unfriend them on social media and screamed at me saying “you get your feelings hurt because you want to. I’m going to keep doing this and it’s your fault if your feelings get hurt.” I should’ve taken that as a sign and left. 

As time went by my jealousy would get worse and my confidence levels no longer existed. I became so needy to the point where I would ask what he was doing all the time and he got fed up and slapped me. Again, I didn’t take that as a sign cause I loved him. 

In November 2018 my mom kicked me out of the house because I got into an argument with one of her sisters. Of course she took their side and I was out on the streets. I lived in my car for a few days since I have no other family and occasionally my bf would sneak me into his house. I had a job but I had just started so I didn’t have money for my own place. His mom let me stay there for the remainder of the year until I was able to find my own please. I ended up getting pregnant and I told him about it...his reaction was to get mad, slap me, grab me by the hair and tell me I was stupid for not taking care of myself. He said he was too young to end his life and he didn’t want anything of it. 

January 2nd 2019 he forced me to get an abortion. I was afraid to live on the streets again and had nowhere to go so I remained in his house. I said I wasn’t going to get an abortion and that I could keep the baby and take care of it myself and he wouldn’t have to worry about it. He continued to beat me and said if I didn’t go thru with the abortion he’d beat it out of me. I passed out in the waiting room of the abortion clinic because I was so scared and didn’t want to go through with it. One of the nurses took me to the back and gave me some Coca Cola to help my blood pressure levels. I remember crying so much and not being able to tell her why. When I heard the little heart beat I couldn’t contain myself yet I was so afraid. I was 8 weeks. The 2nd visit I had to speak to a counselor before the procedure and I was hoping she’d ask me if it was my choice and if I really wanted to go through with it. I wanted to hear her say that if it was against my will she could help. She didn’t. Instead she explained the procedure and showed me how it would work with a little model on her desk. I was so afraid about many things yet I did nothing about it. I was sedated via an IV and given Valium. I remember waking up crying so much because I knew it was over and my baby was gone. I was heavily sedated but I remember feeling my shirt was drenched in tears and the nurse had to walk me out to the car where my bf was waiting. She told him I was heavily sedated and that I wouldn’t stop crying. She said he had to make sure I ate and comfort me. I cried the whole way home and pretty much the whole day. I hated myself and still do. Till this day I hate myself more than him because I didn’t do anything to stop this. I was alone and couldn’t tell anyone other then him what was happening to me. I had no place to go other than his house. 

As time went by things changed. He became nicer, the beatings stop for a little bit until he moved in with me to my new place. When we get into serious arguments he tends to pull my hair or push me or punch me in the face. I’ve wanted to report him to the cops several times but he never leaves any signs. He’s also verbally abusive and emotionally. I’ve never bled, he hasn’t left any noticeable bruises and he’s never pulled hair out of my head to show as evidence. I feel like if I say anything they won’t believe me and it will make things worse when he comes back home. 

I also looked up domestic violence signs and I’m afraid they’ll charge me for domestic violence since I would check his phone without permission and invade his privacy in social media. I don’t want to go to jail. I never called him names and never laid a hand on him not even in self defense. 

I’m sorry this post is so long but I just had to vent. Can anyone help me or guide me? Please don’t be harsh with me in regards to the abortion or all the things I’m allowing him to do. I already hate myself enough and I’m just afraid since I have no one else but him.",domesticviolence,"I’m confused, alone and afraid.",https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/gykc5n/im_confused_alone_and_afraid/,True

He had always expressed to me how bad his anger used to be and how it's under control now. I never saw anything overly aggressive apart from some trust and control issues that weren't huge. 

When Covid began, we quarantined together and were working out in his workshop daily. We began to argue a bit as it was too much at once to be with each other 24/7. One night at the gym/shop, he was joking around and choked me but he grabbed me extremely hard and I instantly panicked because my vision went and I couldn't breathe. I finally got him to let go and I noticed that I felt out of body, my eyes were hurting, head hurting, etc. He just walked away back to his workout. I made it clear I wasn't mad but that I was in pain so I decided to sit out of the workout in fear of passing out. He then got angry and told me we had to leave, he got very quiet in car and asked me if I needed to go the hospital but with such a cold tone in his voice. I said no and we came home. He continued to be very annoyed with me and when I asked what was going on he said that ""it's always something that ruins his workout and when he can't workout he gets angry"". I felt very sad that this happened and I did not want him to cut his workout short and I was not angry. 

A week goes by and the fights got worse and I couldn't deal with it anymore. The night before we ended things, we got into a fight that really was silly but he got very angry. So much so that he went extremely red and got scary. He was screaming at me to ""come here"" because I wouldn't come near him. He went outside and punched the door in and was screaming. 

I hadn't seen him like what before and it was really scary. Things have ended and we haven't talked in about a month but I am finding myself caught up on the choking, I am thinking about it a lot, having nightmares about it... Worried that he was angry at himself for this happening again to him (I'm assuming here but maybe it's happened before?)

After 5 years together, and 4+ years of dealing with physical, emotional, and financial abuse, I am done. I have made a plan to move in with my cousin. Her and my best friend are the only two who have any idea what is going on in my relationship. Our lease begins the first week of July, and my god am i ready for my freedom.

Funnily enough (in a very morbid way) after I came back from the hospital today so get a sling around my arm because he tore my shoulder muscle from slamming me to the ground the other day, I got the call. “I’ve made the deposit, we move in the first week of July” I cried right there on the sidewalk. After years of abuse I’m going to be free.

My escape plan however, needs the kinks worked out. Due to the current world situation, im currently unemployed and he is working from home. I planned to leave and take my animals (all registered under my name and my name alone) when he was gone, but i now have no idea when that will happen. He has random parts hanging around the house that he’s trying to sell, i was honestly considering hiring someone in the ny/nj area to buy the part off of him and offer extra for him to drive to ship it to them so i can make my escape while he is gone. I’ve also contacted my bank to remove myself as an authorized used on our shared cc. Also our lease was up last year and we have been paying month to month so no problems there as well.

I know there is so much more that I need to do before leaving but I just want to make sure I do everything I can to keep him from finding me because I legitimately think he’ll try to kill me when he finds out. My dad is still paying for my phone while im in college so my abuser has no access to the account. I plan to change my phone number as well and tell all my fanily not to respond to any of his attempts to contact them.

Another issue is that we also go to the same university, we are both set to graduate next year. But since I am going through with this I wouldn’t feel safe at my university and plan on taking the year off. Not only for safety, but I’m going to need some serious mental health guidance after this, my grades are already in the toilet because of it so I need a break.

Other than the shared card, there’s no other money I owe him or have tied up with him anywhere.

I will first provide information about the urgent situation, and provide background information further down in the post.

I currently live in the US. My dad and mom live in Singapore with my younger brother who is in high school. My Dad has been abusive towards my mother for a long time; mostly emotionally and verbally, but has recently been physically abusive as well. My dad recently sold our house in Singapore, and put half the money from the sale into my mom's account, and my family has moved apartments a few times since.

Today he sent her a message saying that she had to transfer all the money to his account by the end of the day, and to send him her bank statements since Jan 2020. There was no explicit threat, but it is strongly implied by the history of abuse. My mom has reached out to a counsellor, who said that she needs to come in to the office in person to register for a case worker. My mom is afraid that if my dad finds out she's reached out to a counsellor, he will get violent. She is currently working from home, so is locked in her room and cannot leave until evening, after work, which is after the counsellor's office closes. We're afraid of what might happen at the end of the day if she's still at home and hasn't transferred the money (which she doesn't want to do for reasons explained below). She has reached out to the counsellor about the situation, but has not yet received a response.

She can go to my uncle's (mom's brother) house, which is where she's gone when things have gotten bad in the past. But she usually views this as a last-resort option as she doesn't like to burden her brother. She also doesn't usually leave the house during the day, so if she checks out of work and leaves to go to the counsellor's office, my dad will know something is up, and my mom doesn't like to leave my brother alone with him when he's angry.

What is the best course of action here? I understand that the laws in Singapore may be different from the laws in the US or wherever you're from, but any advice or insight is appreciated. I personally have no idea what to tell her, and feel guilty that I don't know what to do.

P.S. I have crossposted this to other subs. Please let me know if there is anywhere else I can post this to get some advice

\------

In the current apartment, my mom's monthly salary is equal to the monthly rent. My dad makes 4 times what my mom does (because she took many years off work to raise my brother and me, and is now above the age of 50). My dad refused to pay for the rent a couple of months last year. When my mom explains that she cannot cover the rent herself because she does not earn enough, he because EXTREMELY vile and abusive, and sometimes physically so. He calls her a leech (among other things), and asks her why she can't just go earn more. He also refuses to pay for anything else except for my brother's school tuition, but the rent is the biggest burden on my mom.

My mom thinks he is doing this to wipe out all of the money in her account, which would allow him to control her completely. She doesn't want to let go of it because it's all she has, and doesn't want to live with my dad after my brother graduates high school (also we don't know if he's going to pay for my brother's college. I'm a PhD student so I don't make nearly enough to support anyone).

In January of this year, my dad agreed to pay the 80% of the rent. He did so until March, and has not paid rent since. My mom only found out about this a couple of days ago from our landlord. She confronted him about this, but he again became abusive. The lease in solely in my mom's name. She has paid the rent for April, May, and June, but the money in her account is starting to drop very fast.

My dad is very weird about money. He's always trying some pseudo get-rich-quick scheme like property flipping or options trading, but he's lost a lot of money on these ventures because he has no idea what he's doing. When he gets stressed about money, he becomes abusive. He is also an alcoholic, and becomes more abusive when he's drunk. My mom is very afraid of my dad, especially when he's angry and **especially** when he's drunk. My 14 year-old brother once had to push my dad away from my mom when he was drunk and abusing her physically. She spends most of the time at home locked in her room, and this is exacerbated by the current lockdown.

My mom is reluctant to call the cops on him because she thinks it will negatively affect my brother's life, and she thinks keeping the family unit together even if only in name is worth the trauma. We are also reluctant to call the cops on him because my mom does not make enough money to afford to pay for an apartment and my brother's tuition, and still have enough money to send him to college. My aforementioned uncle is semi-wealthy and has been very generous with lending us money when we've needed it in the past, so I'm sure he will at least help, but my mom doesn't want to burden him. My uncle is the only other family we have in Singapore because we are originally from India.

I'm not sure how much evidence we have against him. I (and hopefully my brother) will vehemently testify against him about the abuse, and so will my uncle. My mother probably has chat logs of abuse on Whatsapp. I've asked her to download a voice recording app, and start recording when she thinks he is going to get abusive.

For nearly two years now I have been buried beneath the insecurity and jealousy that had consumed me after my boyfriend had beat me outdoors in broad daylight. I’ve been on here a handful of times looking for strength and support only to wake up the next morning and call him myself. 

The jealousy comes from knowing that in his previous relationship he had never laid a hand on her. I would consistently pry as you why he was able to hurt me but not his ex. I feel like an evil person almost wishing that it had been something all his exes were exposed to, but deep down if there is any clarity or sense left in my brain I am thankful that harm never came to her - it just makes me feel as if there is something I had done to deserve it. 

I’ve left him tonight. Not because he had hurt me again but because as time continued I noticed that I became more resentful that he was now treating me kindly with respect and tenderness AFTER completely burning all of the bridges from him to my family/friends and hurting me. We had decided upon the last incident of physical abuse that he would no longer drink because he had been aggressive with me whenever he was drunk. Sometimes I lay at night and question what is compelling me to stay with a man who I would not be able to trust under the influence of alcohol, that I am fearful to drink with because I am doing all in my power to avoid a chokehold at the end of the night. 

I’ve been surrounded by my friends tonight. They have been talking to me on the phone up until I was convinced that I am tired - but once I am alone the flood of loneliness and desperation has began to sit in. But this time I hope to be better and smarter, and to instead share where I am at tonight here with a community who may also understand what I am going through.

So I can’t take him to court for spousal support. He has made it clear that he no longer wants me around. He’s also gotten a new fiancé. He made me leave this past weekend because she and her father came to visit. He hid all my clothes, items, etc. to basically hide my existence. When I came back home, I discovered my clothes and items were in boxes and trash bags.

I only have a part time job. I’m trying to find some type of rental assistance so I can move. When I came home from work last night, I saw all the boxes in my room. They weren’t even neatly placed. He told me before I have two months to move (that’s when the lease ends). I yelled because I asked him earlier in the day if he could put my stuff back where he found it. Yet he just put all my stuff in the boxes in the middle of the room. We got into an argument and in the middle of it, he gets in my face and yells “do you want me to hit you?” I think it was the adrenaline because I said “do it and I’ll call my family and 911.” This doesn’t even make sense because my family is on the other side of the country. Yet it was the only thing I could think of. He then got his phone to record me. I said “my husband just threatened to hit me and I told him I’ll call 911 if he does.” He stopped recording after that. Eventually, I just started sobbing and it hit me that my husband threatened to hit me. I told him and he blamed me. He said I was blocking him (I honestly don’t remember doing that but he can easily push me aside if I was) and that I had spittle coming out of my mouth. I’m pretty sure he’s trying to make me seem crazy to his fiancé. He called her after. 

I don’t feel safe yet I feel I’m blowing this out of proportion. I wanted to leave but thought “there’s no where to go.” I went back to my room to try to sleep. I feel exhausted. I’m not sure what to do. I don’t want to talk to my family or friends about this. Like I don’t want anyone to overreact.

Here’s some examples:

He brought me to a bank and had me sign a paper with a legit notary “promising to give away my unborn child”. This was against my will. The only reason I did it was so he’d give me a ride to the airport so I could leave his ass. He Harassed me all summer to give away the baby before I “corrupted it” (while I was still pregnant) THEN he tried to use this notarized paper against me in a custody dispute. Claiming to be dad of the year. (Now he’s an absent parent)

Here’s another fun one. He got me intoxicated, allowed his friend to sexually assault me. Convinced me I’d consented to it. And then a year later allowed the same friend to MOVE INTO OUR FUCKING HOUSE against my consent. And literally made me feel GUILTY because I understandably didn’t want his friend living there.... Then in front of me and this friend, he commented that he would be ok with allowing other men to have sex with me as long as he was in the room.  Like what the actual f^%%

One last one: He got me to drop out of nursing school, so I’d be able to move away with him. So I did what he said. Once we moved away I switched majors. He proceeded to try and tell me that I was a failure for dropping out of nursing school. And that my new major was worthless and I should’ve asked permission first.

Two years ago he stole my phone out of my hands to read what I was saying to my friend. I was talking to her because he’d said he hates my voice and my face, I’m annoying and he wants me to go away. He also threw me on the floor that time. 

About a year ago we had a fight in the restaurant we worked at and he called me a fucking bitch shouted go fuck yourself in front of everyone and stormed out. We didn’t speak for three months and he was angry all that time. Eventually I’d left my bag in the restaurant overnight and he came in one morning screaming about how much he hates me and dumped my stuff into the toilet. 

After that he sincerely apologised for being so crazy and we became friends. After many months we got back together, now we are living together with his dad in the country because our restaurant closed down and we lost our jobs. Yesterday he got angry and I tried to get him to talk to me, he kneed me in the face threw me on the ground and punched me. I said I’m definitely leaving and organised my friend to come and get me when it’s the right time. 

Then he talked to me about it, at first he said it was my fault, id wanted him to hit me and taunted him. I said that’s not what happened and eventually he was sorry and said he would not do it again. But when I asked him what he would do instead or how he was going to work on it he got angry again and said I should work on my social issues like “not knowing when to shut up”. I said I need time to get over it and later on decided to make the peace. 

I KNOW that literally everything in this situation points to that I should leave because he’s going to do it again, he blames me for it and thinks I deserve it, and isn’t going to even try to change. I am basically ready to go and can call my friend at any time. But I can’t bring myself to. Does anyone know what’s going on? Do I want to stay? Has anyone else felt like this?

1) I've done my best to document my ex partner's abuse over the past 3 years as best I could (still things I wish I'd done, but even so, I have a LOT) - thousands of highly abusive text messages, video recordings, voice messages, paperwork on the 7 times he's been institutionalized (yes, seven). I finally reached my limit with his abusive texts and INCESSANT calling and went full no contact about three months ago. But a few days ago I realized he'd been driving past my house /parking there etc. and Im terrified. My attorney said the best move forward is to file for a stalking protection order, which is great because I'm tired of living in fear, but it also means that I have no fewer than 14 days to get all of this evidence I've collected together for the hearing.

2) I've been working to build a timeline / narrative / documentation with exhibits for MONTHS and I'm still nowhere near close to being done. It's super triggering and as a single mom of a toddler, it's not like I have tons of time on my hands. I work full time. I give my daughter 110% of my fully engaged self, and then I have to sit down and go through all this stuff after I put her to bed and clean the house. 

How does anyone manage to do all of this? I feel like I'm trying to drink water from a firehose. I can't risk not providing the courts all of the information to show how truly unsafe he is but I'm also not a machine. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to organize thousands of text messages/videos quickly (and in a way that would be accepted by a court?). I've downloaded apps, paid for software, but I'm still drowning in this process. 

Teach me your survival stories. There's got to be something that I'm not doing right (or just not doing at all) because I simply can't imagine that any person, especially a person who is suffering from PTSD due to extreme abuse, can just pull all this together at the drop of a hat.

I was visiting a childhood friend today. We haven't seen each other in a year and decided to have a small party/gathering with some friends at his place. His parents were away for the evening and would come back later that evening. Since he lives quite far away, he invited me to stay over night and go home the next day. 
After the party we went upstairs to his room and watched a movie. His father was downstairs in the living room watching tv and his mom went to sleep in the room next to us.
At some point late that night, we heard some glass breaking downstairs. We thought his father might have dropped a plate or something, so we didn't go to check on him. However, mom woke up and went downstairs to see what happened. 
They had a short argument and then she started screaming and called for my friend. He went to the living room and I stayed in his room. I heard his mom yell that he (his dad) hit her in the face. She stormed off and locked herself in her room. My friend cleaned up the mess downstairs and came back upstairs and didn't say a word for the rest of the night. We finished the movie and I went to bed in another room upstairs.

It's almost 4 in the morning and I can't sleep. I'm afraid and I don't know what to do.

Said hes opening up a new case on me to get the kids back and that I need to stop ""running from him"". Spooked me very much considering the circumstances, so I reported it. Cop came out and saw my evidence and screen recording etc, said ""alright this looks good to me, let me take your order and get pictures of it in my car"" when he came back he said the order was popping up in his system as ""not served"" therefore charges couldnt be pressed on their behalf.  I called the city I'd fled from and had the civil rights rep email me my court transcripts that prove he was present at our last court date in August 2019 in attempt to modify the restraining &amp; custody order (it was denied). At the end of the 2019 court transcript, it reads ""Restraining Order(s) heretofore made to remain in effect"" I called police back in current city to ask if someone could take my report now that I had this information, someone took it and forwarded it to the DA. Very solid evidence. The officer just said they may run into an obstacle with the fact that it says ""not served"" in their system when it comes to the DA.

I started responding by saying I felt like he left me during the party and practically acts like we don’t know each other while interacting with everyone else, especially girls. I told him it hurts my feelings and he told me I have a mouth I should use it if I want to feel included. Which I did! I was talking to people, but I just felt like (and this is how I usually feel in groups with him) that he was specifically ignoring me, like wouldn’t even look at me. And I didn’t want to be that annoying girlfriend who can’t make her own friends or needs to be babysat at a party which I’m not, I just don’t know if I’m being unreasonable about wanting him to acknowledge me more even with just a touch or a little consideration while we’re out and hanging with people.

I threw the car in park and ran out onto the sidewalk as far away as I could. He then got in the drivers seat and then drove off.

He then calls me about 30 minutes later apologizing and saying he was just angry at me and he’s very sorry for being physical and that he only said the hurtful thing about couples therapy because he was very upset and he didn’t mean it at all, he just wanted to say something to hurt me.

This is my first and only boyfriend in my 25 years of life. In the beginning everything was beautiful and I felt so loved but then things changed. A year and a half into the relationship I found out my bf would masturbate to pictures of his girl best friends and even to pictures of his sister in laws. I asked him to stop since he was so close to them and even asked him to stop hanging out with them if he saw them in any way other then as friends. He told me he felt nothing for them and what he was doing was normal and had no emotional connection. He said he didn’t even want to have real sex with them. I began to get jealous and insecure so I would check his phone often and realized he continued to do it. I didn’t leave him because that was my first bf and felt like I loved him. One day he got annoyed that I kept asking him to unfriend them on social media and screamed at me saying “you get your feelings hurt because you want to. I’m going to keep doing this and it’s your fault if your feelings get hurt.” I should’ve taken that as a sign and left. 

As time went by my jealousy would get worse and my confidence levels no longer existed. I became so needy to the point where I would ask what he was doing all the time and he got fed up and slapped me. Again, I didn’t take that as a sign cause I loved him. 

In November 2018 my mom kicked me out of the house because I got into an argument with one of her sisters. Of course she took their side and I was out on the streets. I lived in my car for a few days since I have no other family and occasionally my bf would sneak me into his house. I had a job but I had just started so I didn’t have money for my own place. His mom let me stay there for the remainder of the year until I was able to find my own please. I ended up getting pregnant and I told him about it...his reaction was to get mad, slap me, grab me by the hair and tell me I was stupid for not taking care of myself. He said he was too young to end his life and he didn’t want anything of it. 

January 2nd 2019 he forced me to get an abortion. I was afraid to live on the streets again and had nowhere to go so I remained in his house. I said I wasn’t going to get an abortion and that I could keep the baby and take care of it myself and he wouldn’t have to worry about it. He continued to beat me and said if I didn’t go thru with the abortion he’d beat it out of me. I passed out in the waiting room of the abortion clinic because I was so scared and didn’t want to go through with it. One of the nurses took me to the back and gave me some Coca Cola to help my blood pressure levels. I remember crying so much and not being able to tell her why. When I heard the little heart beat I couldn’t contain myself yet I was so afraid. I was 8 weeks. The 2nd visit I had to speak to a counselor before the procedure and I was hoping she’d ask me if it was my choice and if I really wanted to go through with it. I wanted to hear her say that if it was against my will she could help. She didn’t. Instead she explained the procedure and showed me how it would work with a little model on her desk. I was so afraid about many things yet I did nothing about it. I was sedated via an IV and given Valium. I remember waking up crying so much because I knew it was over and my baby was gone. I was heavily sedated but I remember feeling my shirt was drenched in tears and the nurse had to walk me out to the car where my bf was waiting. She told him I was heavily sedated and that I wouldn’t stop crying. She said he had to make sure I ate and comfort me. I cried the whole way home and pretty much the whole day. I hated myself and still do. Till this day I hate myself more than him because I didn’t do anything to stop this. I was alone and couldn’t tell anyone other then him what was happening to me. I had no place to go other than his house. 

As time went by things changed. He became nicer, the beatings stop for a little bit until he moved in with me to my new place. When we get into serious arguments he tends to pull my hair or push me or punch me in the face. I’ve wanted to report him to the cops several times but he never leaves any signs. He’s also verbally abusive and emotionally. I’ve never bled, he hasn’t left any noticeable bruises and he’s never pulled hair out of my head to show as evidence. I feel like if I say anything they won’t believe me and it will make things worse when he comes back home. 

I also looked up domestic violence signs and I’m afraid they’ll charge me for domestic violence since I would check his phone without permission and invade his privacy in social media. I don’t want to go to jail. I never called him names and never laid a hand on him not even in self defense. 

I’m sorry this post is so long but I just had to vent. Can anyone help me or guide me? Please don’t be harsh with me in regards to the abortion or all the things I’m allowing him to do. I already hate myself enough and I’m just afraid since I have no one else but him.",domesticviolence,"I’m confused, alone and afraid.",https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/gykc5n/im_confused_alone_and_afraid/,True

He had always expressed to me how bad his anger used to be and how it's under control now. I never saw anything overly aggressive apart from some trust and control issues that weren't huge. 

When Covid began, we quarantined together and were working out in his workshop daily. We began to argue a bit as it was too much at once to be with each other 24/7. One night at the gym/shop, he was joking around and choked me but he grabbed me extremely hard and I instantly panicked because my vision went and I couldn't breathe. I finally got him to let go and I noticed that I felt out of body, my eyes were hurting, head hurting, etc. He just walked away back to his workout. I made it clear I wasn't mad but that I was in pain so I decided to sit out of the workout in fear of passing out. He then got angry and told me we had to leave, he got very quiet in car and asked me if I needed to go the hospital but with such a cold tone in his voice. I said no and we came home. He continued to be very annoyed with me and when I asked what was going on he said that ""it's always something that ruins his workout and when he can't workout he gets angry"". I felt very sad that this happened and I did not want him to cut his workout short and I was not angry. 

A week goes by and the fights got worse and I couldn't deal with it anymore. The night before we ended things, we got into a fight that really was silly but he got very angry. So much so that he went extremely red and got scary. He was screaming at me to ""come here"" because I wouldn't come near him. He went outside and punched the door in and was screaming. 

I hadn't seen him like what before and it was really scary. Things have ended and we haven't talked in about a month but I am finding myself caught up on the choking, I am thinking about it a lot, having nightmares about it... Worried that he was angry at himself for this happening again to him (I'm assuming here but maybe it's happened before?)

This is my first personal post to a forum like this in a really long time. I've always been made fun of and attacked for not having the textbook, loving relationship with my mom. This has made it really difficult to ask for help from anyone, as I'm used to my feelings being rejected. I'm in college now, but I've had this issue for my entire life. I live with my mom--my dad passed when I was young so its been the two of us for a really long time. She works a high-stress job and has always expected me to take school as seriously as she does her work. This means never hanging out with my friends after school if I don't want her calling and texting me a million times. If it were up to her, I'd be chained to a desk doing work 24/7 with a gag in my mouth. In middle school I was bullied to the point of self harm but she never even made an attempt to address the problem, saying that I was only 'being a baby' because I didn't want to do more work. When I told her what I was doing to myself she fully didn't believe me, calling me a pussy. I was 13. This attitude has persisted. Whenever other people are around us, she pretends as if we have this caring relationship when the reality is we really don't. She's good at acting as if it's true, so when we're at dinner with her friends and she says all these things about how hard I work all it does is make my blood boil. She calls me nicknames that she makes up on the spot and sends me looks as if she actually expects me to do the same. I'm not sure how sick in the head she is: i don't know if she actually believes that I love her or if this is all manipulation of me and her friends. The one person who's believed me is our neighbor, but even she only believed me when I was old enough for her to and when I had been telling her about the abuse for years on end. Whenever people leave the two of us alone, she goes on tirades about how I've failed her. I admit it's not just her that is nasty towards me, now that I'm older I know what she's doing is wrong and I call hr out on it. Probably not in the best ways, but I promise you I would never reciprocate the same energy she's sent my way. I've shown up to school with bruises more times than I can count and no one has ever thought twice about it or said anything to me. She's threatened me with her boyfriends and co-workers, saying that if I don't comply she's gonna get her boyfriend to beat me. People tell me I'm outgoing and confident, so I'm sure it's easy for people to laugh about the problems I have with my mom, believing that I'm exaggerating to be funny. A couple years ago I posted on socials that I got kicked out of the house on a school night in the middle of winter, and all the responses were ""haha epic"". I've convinced myself that the only reaction people will have to me talking about my mom issues is either laughter or disgust because that's been 99% of the responses. Whenever I bring up how she's treated me to her face, she denies everything. She even denies me hurting myself, she denies ever hitting me. This has driven me to the point of insanity. I know that she's never going to change so I need to find better ways of handling her. I've never had a conversation with someone who's had a similar experience but I'm hoping posting this will help me with that. I know there're people like me out there, I wish I had an easier time talking about it so that I could find them. I don't want my horrible relationship and experiences with her to carry over into other aspects of my life as I become an adult and move away. I have a really hard time dealing with her and she ruins a lot of my days. I wish I knew how to prevent her from doing this to me. I know that my anger towards her won't just go away if I move away and never respond to her, I have to process and heal. If anyone has advice on how to lessen her affect on me and how to process traumatizing childhood events I would appreciate it. Also, if there are more specific forums surrounding familial abuse I'm really looking to find support for this.

This is a throwaway and I'll change small insignificant details to keep myself safe.

He is a little older than me but really immature. Hes so angry, all the time. The smallest things, an argument over me dropping a tiny bit of food can end up in him threatening to throw furniture at me.
I know its totally wrong. We bought a new house recently and I've had food and drink thrown over me, totally humiliating although it doesn't hurt.

I'm a stay at home worker with the stuff thats going on at the minute. He's not. I clean daily, cook everything including his meals for the night shifts he works.

But he says I do nothing. Just accuses me daily of playing on the Xbox all day (I definitely do not. 1 hour at most, or not at all). 

I'm feisty too and not one to take loads of abuse but it gets so out of hand and he either threatens me, throws things at me or breaks stuff and has hurt me before. He once pulled me round the garden by my hair and I lost chunks of it. 

So why do I feel no anger once it's done? Why am I so forgiving, and just want to love him and be loved? Cos when things are good they're awesome and about 10 mins after hes finished being like that I just want things to be fine and theres never any hard feelings on my part. I'm totally in love and just want to get on with stuff. Thats not normal is it, but I cant shake it off.

Also sometimes I feel guilty because of things I said or did when retaliating or to protect myself. I once kicked out at him because I was scared and caused a nasty bruise. Thats makes me feel like I cant tell anyone because I've done wrong too.

It’s just like in the movie!!!!!!! And it’s real!!! 
And it’s happening to me!!!! 

One day i take one step forward,, i see the advertisement about domestic violence, and i start to call that number, they book me appointment for seeing the advocate, then i met her (my husb dunno about it) 
I tell him i go shoping , then i sneak to the DV advocates office, 
When i met her, i tell her about everything,, and she said i must leave him , i said i’m not ready, because i still believe in him, he will change for me, i want good marriage, and i want once marriage for forever,,,have a family,,, 

Second visit i arrange with DV advocate, and still same i answer i not ready to leave,,,because “i love him”

After 6 months from my last visit to DV advocate, it’s normal day, after work, i cleaning, laundry, cooking,,
When i hang laundry (he help me hang the laundry) he found out that his note inside his shorts is damage, he start being furious to me,, call me “fucking moron” “what an idiot” “useless cunt” ,, over the note :(
He start lock me in the laundry room, then he go through my phone for checking if i message anyone,, i scream “help help” no one hear me,, i just crying,, not crying because i am hurt physically , but i am crying because i am hurt inside,, mentally hurt :(( ,,,, this is my husband,, he supposed to protect me,, love me,, comfort me,,, makes me happy,,, but he is not :((

Then for 30 mins im crying in the room,, he let me out,, he not allow me sleeping on the bed “if i found out in the morning you sleeping on the bed, i will punch your fcking face” 
And once again,, i start crying,, not because i sleep on the floor, i can sleep everywhere doesnt matter for me i am easy, but i am crying because my husband treat me worse than animal,, until now i still remember how mentally hurt i am at that time thinking, he supposed to be the one that protect me....

Then the next day, i comebck frm work, i try to apologize just to make a peace for our marriage, but still he yelling at me ask me to take out all of my food from the fridge, because it’s his fridge, and i start to take out my food and he still try arguing with me, and he yell at me “just close the fckin fridge” how i close the fridge if you ask me to take out all of my food,, then suddenly from the back he push my head inside the fridge and choke me, i am crying i feel weak,, and that time i said to my self “this is enough for me” enough is enough,, i cant take it anymore,,,
After he choke me for 1 minute, i just running outside,, i go to the police,,, and report him..
When i am running to the police my heart broken,,, 
My sacrifice is nothing...
I am wasting my time...
My marriage is a joke...
He lied to me the whole entire time...
I feel i am his muppet!!! I am not my self!!!

It’s not all of his abusive behavior to me that i can explain to me, i might ended up wrote a book! 

But the lesson that i take from what i’ve been through,,,
Love never hurt you,,,
No one can makes you happy! Your happiness is your own responsibility!...
Love your self 👸🏻🤗❤️😘

I feel like i be my self now,, i can breath,, i can do anything i want,,, i am Happy just with my self... 
And i dont have any expectation to anyone...
I just do good things to anyone and not hurt anyone 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽

If anyone out there been through the same situation as me,,, don’t wait until tomorrow,, step out now,, you are strong,, you are beautiful just the way you are,,, 
You are not alone,,, 
Google “domestic violence” in your country internet, it will have information for organization that help you out from domestic violence,, 
No one in this world deserve domestic violence,,
They not love you if they hurt you!

God, was she charming. She swept me off my feet the moment we met, I don't usually fall for people 

but she had everything I liked. She was tall (6ft) and butch and I was smitten by her protectiveness and how she treated me. 

She bought me dinners (I never paid for a single thing, she wouldn't let me pay or even tip myself), jewelry, clothes, took me out, just all that kind of stuff. It was a first to me to have someone treat me so... I don't know like I was special. She made me feel special. It was ok at first. 

Then at home one day she's talking about work, complaining about something, and I made a sarcastic quip about the situation. Don't even remember what I said, next thing I know I'm holding onto the side of my face because she's smacked me across my cheek. I just kinda sat there shocked and asked 

if she really just hit me, she said she didn't mean to hit me that hard. I didn't know what to do so I just said it was ok, it was a mistake and a one time thing, we went to bed. 

My life changed after that night. She became demanding, scary, intimidating. I'm 5'3 140lbs, she was 6' and little over 300lbs, so she constantly used her large frame to back me into corners while berating me over something I said or did, restraining me if I ever tried to get away, pinning me against walls to show she was stronger than I was. Stuff like that. 

One bad night we went to a bar, I went to the patio to smoke and another woman followed me and started hitting on me, asking to buy me another drink. I was explaining I was here with someone when my girlfriend walked out and flipped the fuck out. She walked over and I guess her look or something sent the other woman scurrying away, while I began to be yelled at about being a lying, cheating whore (the usual go to). 

I was tired that night so I got up and walked away, out of the bar while figuring out how the fuck I was going to get home. She of course followed me, and I blame myself for letting her pull me into an alley. I should have stayed in view of other people. Well she screamed at me some more, wouldn't 

stop grabbing me and she finally pushed too hard and I stumbled backwards and smashed my face into the cement wall and suddenly I found myself spitting out one of my teeth as it was cracked and broken by the impact. 

I still fucking stayed. I started crying and she hugged me and apologized, we went home and I just laid in bed while she did whatever she wanted to me and waited for her to be done and fall asleep so I could just cry into my pillow. 

It became all the time. The hits became routine. Around her friends (I was not allowed to speak to my friends cause the me being a whore and all) she would make fun of me for being mentally ill, that I was so stupid I had to drop out of college, she had to take care of me, ect ect. If I said something she didn't like she'd pinch me and twist (like sitting at the table she could pretend to pat my thigh while really she was punishing me for what I said). 

She quickly learned the key was not to hit me in the face or choke me because that leaves bruises where people could see. So my chest/ribs, lower back, and legs were all fair game. 

I never realized others noticed when I was once again explaining walking awkwardly because I fell (again), or ran into a door (again), or slipped in the shower. The excuses were bullshit to everyone but they whispered to each other never asked if I was ok. 

She convinced me to get off my meds for my bipolar disorder. She told me she liked me manic 

because I was better in bed. So I stopped, my depression became worse, I was becoming more isolated and had no one to talk to, and my anxiety was at it's worst in my life.

But I didn't tell anyone what was going on. I felt like I deserved it. I hated myself, so it seemed fitting to be hit and degraded since I was so self loathing. 

Then someone did reach out. 

I got a text from an unknown person, asking if she had the right number. I said yes, who is this? 

They wouldn't tell me who they were, just they were friends with my girlfriend and they thought something was going on. She or he told me they had been in an abusive relationship in the past and every time they saw me with my partner they could see something was up. They also informed me she was making fun of me (like were teenagers not in our mid 20's) to her group of friends. 

Apparently, she would mock my depression and said I was nasty, that I threatened to kill myself if she left me, that I pulled out my hair, cut myself for attention, discussed our bedroom activities and showed pictures I had sent her sexting in the past. 

I was humiliated. But it was the last straw, I don't know what clicked but I realized I needed to get the fuck out, this needed to end now. 

So while she was at work I gathered all my things and left, went back to my parents home, and just sat in one of the bedrooms crying for hours and throwing up because I was terrified she was going to come after me. She sent me some vile texts and I eventually had to block her on everything as she was harassing the fuck out of me. 

The things I trusted her enough to tell her, like being raped as a child, was all used against me. She told anyone who would listen the things I told her in confidence. But I wasn't mad, I was numb. So what? I asked myself, I could easily disprove or correct the things she was saying so I thought screw her. 

I told my psych what had been going on and he was very supportive, told me I was worth more than someone abusing me, I didn't deserve it, he was just really nice about it. He didn't make me feel like it was my fault and that felt good. Hell, it just felt good telling someone what had been going on since I had bottled it up for over a year.

I'm back on meds now and in a lot better place than I was just three months ago. I'm working on coping with substance abuse (being drunk made being hit not hurt as badly, and I preferred being able to pass out while she used my body how she wanted in bed) and it's a struggle but without being abused and scared all the time I think I might be able to work on that now. 

I know this was a long rambling rant but I just am so bewildered why I put up with the abuse for so 

long. I'm a victims advocate, I've helped others escape abuse from partners (it's really rampant in the 

LGBT community, just not talked about as much), but I couldn't leave myself because she broke me 

down. I still think sometimes it all happened to another person, as I don't know who that person was 

who was playing the victim role.

I don't know where this is going so I'm going to end this here. Thanks for listening/reading. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to see red flags before it gets too bad? This is now the second partner in my life who has turned abusive, although this one was the worst by far, but I really feel like I am to blame since this keeps happening.

I am a new landlord and my new tenants are generating multiple complaints from the neighbors regarding extremely loud and aggressive fights in the front yard of the house. 1 of the parties is aggressive and the other is not. Both of the parties are in the lease. 

I have not discussed with the tenants yet because I don’t know how. This type of disturbance may violate provisions of the lease that call for “quiet enjoyment of the neighbors”, although I feel strongly that attempting to evict the whole household would be harmful to the victim.

-dislocated my shoulders. 
-broke my ankle. 
-broke my ribs by kicking me. 
-punched my chest and collapsed my lung. 
-punched my stomach hard enough to make me throw up.
-wrecked my face (with punches and knees) left me with bleeding lips, swollen eyes.

I have a boyfriend and he just laughed me off and said the same thing, that my sister is so much smaller than me so she can’t be hurting me that bad. My mom who’s house we live in says the same thing and laughs at me for complaining.

Two years ago he stole my phone out of my hands to read what I was saying to my friend. I was talking to her because he’d said he hates my voice and my face, I’m annoying and he wants me to go away. He also threw me on the floor that time. 

About a year ago we had a fight in the restaurant we worked at and he called me a fucking bitch shouted go fuck yourself in front of everyone and stormed out. We didn’t speak for three months and he was angry all that time. Eventually I’d left my bag in the restaurant overnight and he came in one morning screaming about how much he hates me and dumped my stuff into the toilet. 

After that he sincerely apologised for being so crazy and we became friends. After many months we got back together, now we are living together with his dad in the country because our restaurant closed down and we lost our jobs. Yesterday he got angry and I tried to get him to talk to me, he kneed me in the face threw me on the ground and punched me. I said I’m definitely leaving and organised my friend to come and get me when it’s the right time. 

Then he talked to me about it, at first he said it was my fault, id wanted him to hit me and taunted him. I said that’s not what happened and eventually he was sorry and said he would not do it again. But when I asked him what he would do instead or how he was going to work on it he got angry again and said I should work on my social issues like “not knowing when to shut up”. I said I need time to get over it and later on decided to make the peace. 

I KNOW that literally everything in this situation points to that I should leave because he’s going to do it again, he blames me for it and thinks I deserve it, and isn’t going to even try to change. I am basically ready to go and can call my friend at any time. But I can’t bring myself to. Does anyone know what’s going on? Do I want to stay? Has anyone else felt like this?

1) I've done my best to document my ex partner's abuse over the past 3 years as best I could (still things I wish I'd done, but even so, I have a LOT) - thousands of highly abusive text messages, video recordings, voice messages, paperwork on the 7 times he's been institutionalized (yes, seven). I finally reached my limit with his abusive texts and INCESSANT calling and went full no contact about three months ago. But a few days ago I realized he'd been driving past my house /parking there etc. and Im terrified. My attorney said the best move forward is to file for a stalking protection order, which is great because I'm tired of living in fear, but it also means that I have no fewer than 14 days to get all of this evidence I've collected together for the hearing.

2) I've been working to build a timeline / narrative / documentation with exhibits for MONTHS and I'm still nowhere near close to being done. It's super triggering and as a single mom of a toddler, it's not like I have tons of time on my hands. I work full time. I give my daughter 110% of my fully engaged self, and then I have to sit down and go through all this stuff after I put her to bed and clean the house. 

How does anyone manage to do all of this? I feel like I'm trying to drink water from a firehose. I can't risk not providing the courts all of the information to show how truly unsafe he is but I'm also not a machine. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to organize thousands of text messages/videos quickly (and in a way that would be accepted by a court?). I've downloaded apps, paid for software, but I'm still drowning in this process. 

Teach me your survival stories. There's got to be something that I'm not doing right (or just not doing at all) because I simply can't imagine that any person, especially a person who is suffering from PTSD due to extreme abuse, can just pull all this together at the drop of a hat.

Said hes opening up a new case on me to get the kids back and that I need to stop ""running from him"". Spooked me very much considering the circumstances, so I reported it.

So anyway I get done telling him how I feel and the fight starts escalating to him screaming at me and then I start screaming back and then while we’re stopped at a stop light he starts choking me for about 10-15 seconds I think, I’m not sure how long it was because I couldn’t breathe and I was terrified. I threw the car in park and ran out onto the sidewalk as far away as I could. He then got in the drivers seat and then drove off. I called his sister to pick me up and when I got home he apologized, but I told him I wanted him to go. He then proceeded to tell me that the months of couples therapy that we have been in has all been a lie and we should be honest that our relationship is shit. I ask him to leave again and he goes. He then calls me about 30 minutes later apologizing and saying he was just angry at me and he’s very sorry for being physical and that he only said the hurtful thing about couples therapy because he was very upset and he didn’t mean it at all, he just wanted to say something to hurt me.

I just don’t know what to do. I’m so confused. I love him and we live together and have always planned on eventually getting married. He definitely has a bad temper and has been very disrespectful in the past, like telling me to shut the fuck up when I tell him how I feel etc. but I can’t help thinking I’m just miserable to be around and I’m very selfish and can only talk about me and how things make ME feel, which is why he’s constantly pissed off when I bring things up and why he got physical tonight. I truly never thought this would happen and I thought our relationship was on the mend.

Yesterday he did it in public and someone called the police but I covered for him. Today he lied to me and I called him out on it and he slammed my head against the ground pull chunks out of my hair, choked me and left bruises and scratch my body.

Alex has been having really loud arguments with their partner ('Taylor'), has been screaming at them, crying, shouting abuse at them, and often throws things. They have since taken a 'relationship break' - Alex and Taylor are still talking but are not broaching emotional topics that could lead to arguments or having sexual discussions. They agreed that they are no longer 'dating' but may revisit a relationship once they can see each other in person again, but also provided some caveats that Alex work on their emotional regulation and Taylor work on their communication.

Alex had been listening to love songs on repeat, looking through old photos, and hasn't been doing any of the work they promised to do on their emotions. They have stated that they can't help their trauma or what triggers them, and they believe that allowances should be made for them. Alex asked for my advice, and I gave it honestly - saying that relationships require compromise and triggers (while valid) can sometimes be irrational. Alex told me that one of their triggers was being controlled, which means they can never compromise. I agreed that controlling behaviour isn't good in a relationship. But I added that if a friend asks you to change something that upsets them, and it doesn't cause too much of an issue for you, it makes sense to try and change that for that friend. (Thinking in my head that Taylor has asked Alex to stop referring to them as derogatory names such as 'b*tch', 'd*ck', and others which are too offensive to type here.) Alex appeared to agree with me and even did some work and chatted to their therapist about it (over video chat).

A few days ago, Alex had a friend sitting outside on the street and we were all having socially distanced drinks. Alex got a bit drunk (on second drink?) and interrupted Alex's friend mid-sentence to shout at me: ""We need to stop this narrative that Alex can't have healthy relationships!"" (Yes referring to themselves in the 3rd person is common.)

It came out of nowhere. I was in the middle of paying for dinner which Alex had chosen and been all to happy to have me pay for.

Me: ""I'm sorry what are you talking about?""

Alex: ""You saying that I can never have healthy relationships is hurtful and unhelpful and it needs to stop!""

Me: ""I never said that you couldn't-""

Alex: ""I don't care. That's what it felt like and it hurts and it needs to stop!""

Me: ""But I never said that and I don't think that. I just said compromise is needed in a relationship. I am not validating what you think I said when I didn't say that and don't think that at all.""

Alex: ""I DON'T CARE!!!! YOU NEED TO STOP!!""

Alex's friend interrupts this and says that we shouldn't have this conversation while drunk. Alex takes a while to calm down but then talks to their friend while I'm sat feeling really afraid and still ordering and paying for dinner.

Alex's friend leaves and Alex goes upstairs and starts shouting on the phone to someone upstairs.

I'm quite afraid because Alex has thrown things at me and 'play hit' me a few times when frustrated (not hard enough to bruise but hard enough to hurt). I had a serious chat with Alex every single time and they keep pushing the boundary, like throwing things at the wall next to my head instead of at me. I've seen how loud and shouty Alex can get while upset, and I know it won't hurt me physically but I don't want to be screamed at or have things thrown at me. I also am concerned that Alex thinks that how what people say makes them feel matters more than what they said (this was a common theme with their arguments with Taylor too) so if I do try and talk about it Alex might not understand what I'm saying or get really really angry at me.

It escalated today. I spoke to my sister at 3pm in my closet in my bedroom and Alex apparently overheard? I've been sat in the living room all evening working on my laptop, when I went in the next room to take a call from my other sister.

Alex messaged me: Hey gal, if you’re going to have calls about me you’ll need to either go elsewhere to have them or keep your voice down And also if you need to move out then go ahead

Me: I'm talking about graduation photos?

Alex: Earlier you weren't.  I don’t know or care what you’re talking about now

Me: Okay

Alex:  But earlier really upset me, and instead of stewing I’m going to tell you  And tell you in future not to say hurtful things so loudly 

Me: I'm actually good thanks. Cool will do.

Alex: *thumbs up*

It turns out that Alex asked Taylor if anyone would have reason to be scared of Alex getting violent when angry or upset and Taylor had to remind Alex that Taylor had been hit, slapped, and had things thrown at them when Alex was upset. But that doesn't seem to be the answer Alex was looking for.

It started small I guess. When I was really young we were like normal, hateful siblings. She would call me names. I would do things to spite her. I guess that was all how it was supposed to be at the time.


Elementary school was different. My mom worked until late at night, no dad in the picture. My sister would chase me around the house and beat me. She would ridicule and insult me the moment I left my room, like some sort of obsession.


As she got older, she became increasingly hostile toward me. She would attack me and chase me to my room, where I would close the door and lock it behind me. She learned to ""pick"" those easy house knobs, so I spent a lot of my elementary school home time with one hand on the door lock and the other hand playing with legos. I vividly remember my counselor asking if my mother tried to hurt me because of the bruises on my body. Thats another story though.


When I got into middle school, she moved on from abusing me. She got into drugs and began to abuse my family instead. My possessions were stolen, scary men came in and out of the house at night and my mother was an emotionally shattered husk. I just became hateful and numb.


I guess thats a really concise way to summarize a lifetime of abuse. There is so much to say, I just wanted to get you caught up.



--------------------------
**The story you probably came for:**


I was 15. I was laying on my bunkbed listening to music on my little speaker set. My phone was connected through an aux cord. I wish that detail didnt matter.


My sister was walking around the house. I could hear the floorboards creeking. I wasnt afraid, but her presence in the house always made me have some primal sense of alertness and anxiety. I was listening to the floorboards and approximating her position in the house, something I did normally.


At some point, she came into my room. This already put me on alert - she usually avoided my room. She just came in and started looking around my room. 


She focused in on my phone and my speaker set and scowled at them. ""You have an aux cord?""


""Yeah,"" I replied, ""just one of those cheap ones so I can connect my phone"" (I was always trying to downplay and mitigate conflict)


She replied with ""I want an aux cord"", followed by an awkward silence. 


I dont know what to say. She isnt getting my aux cord. ""Yeah mom and I found it at goodwill"".


She was examining the cord. ""Mom never gets me nice things.""


I dont know what to say, again. Luckily though, she walked out of the room.


As she walks out of my room and into the hallway, I hear her continuing to speak. It sounds like she is complaining, but I cant make out what she is saying. As she walks down the hallway away from my room, she starts to get louder. It gets to a point where she is screaming something at me from the other side of the house.


I am trying to avoid conflict. I go to my door and I shut it and lock both the door and the *bolt lock* that was installed on my door to protect me from her.


I hear the floorboards again, accompanied by further loud complaints. She is walking back to my room.


She stops at my door and turns the knob. She is obviously pissed that I locked it. ""Open the door.""


I figure with the bolt lock, Im in a position of power. She can fuck right off. ""No. I'm not fighting with you. Please leave.""


She continues. ""Open. The. Door.""


""No. I'm not opening it.""


""Open the fucking door.""


I just dont reply. I tend to lock up when I dont know what to say.


There is a moment of silence. My heart is beating out of my chest.


Suddenly, **BANG**, she kicks the fucking door! Adrenaline shoots through me. She kicks the door again. ""OPEN THIS FUCKING DOOR NOW"".


I dont know what to do. I text my mom. I know she cant help. She keeps kicking the door. The door is holding great. So glad I have a bolt lock.


She stops. I feel instantly relieved. Im thinking to myself that she must have tired herself out... But I dont hear the floorboards. She hasnt left, she is still in front of the door.


Im waiting for her to leave when she starts kicking the door again. She is shouting, but I cant understand what she is saying. I can hear the wood of the door being stressed and I start panicking


I had a shotgun under my bed. It wasnt loaded. I pulled it out and I pointed it at the door. 


I shouted ""(Sister), dont fucking come in here! I have a gu-"" and the door crashes open. The bolt lock has broken right through the frame of the door, which has been splintered. My sister is standing on the other side of the door watching me


**So here I am, pointing a unloaded shotgun at my sister, hoping to use it to bluff her off. *But she takes a step forward***.


(Sister): ""What are you going to do, shoot me?"" She takes another step toward me


""Do it! Fucking shoot me, (slur)! Shoot me!"" She takes another step foward.


""(Slur) (slur)! Fucking kill me!"" Another step


Suddenly she starts sprinting at me, screaming. 


What happened is a blur in my memory, but the next thing I know, I have her pinned to the wall outside my room and the shotgun has scratched a long line in the floor from being thrown down the hallway


Adrenaline was pumping through me. My heart was beating harder than I had ever felt before. She was kicking me. I felt nothing at all. No pain. 


I grabbed her by her throat. I remember her making this terrible choking sound and scratching at her neck. With my other hand, god, forgive me, I just started beating her. I had never fought anyone, I had never thrown a real punch, I had never done anything like that.


Its hard to describe, but it felt like something primal took over. I really just started beating her. Beating her as hard as I could. She was resisting and I just pushed her against the wall harder and beat her more. I was screaming in her face. Screaming about how she was the reason my mother is suicidal, and she is the reason that I camt be happy and..


I have this image burned into my mind, I stopped hitting her for a moment and I just remember there being blood on the wall next to her face and her nose just oozing blood, and I expect to see a look of pain on her face..


.. but.. she just smiled at me. This fucking crazy, wicked, demonic smile. I felt like I was beating a literal monster. She smiled at me and I just went back to beating her. I remember her tooth cutting my finger and I remember not feeling it and just continuing to beat her.


It was the most sickening, primal feeling. It was like I lost control. It was like my body wanted her *dead*. I am not a violent person at all but this was something else entirely.


So I beat her and beat her and beat her. At some point I come to my senses and I drop her. She starts screaming the moment I release her and starts hitting my face. 


Right away, like a reflex, I tackled her back up against the wall and I just started beating her again. Again and again and again and again and again. Once again, I had this primal voice telling me to beat her until she died.


I didnt. I dropped her a second time. This time she fell on her ass. She started crying loudly and jumped out of the hallway into the kitchen and ran into her room. I could hear her crying loudly from the hallway.


I went over and picked the shotgun up off the ground and I went in my room. I sat in the corner of the room and I loaded the shotgun. I pointed it at the door and I called 911.



-----------
**Aftermath**


The police came and my mom rushed home. The police were treating it like I was the abuser to my sister - they were talking about how I was going to be charged with some kind of felony assault (dofferent rules for 'domestic violence?') and I was trying to explain myself and they just werent having it at all. 


My mom arrived and started yelling at the officers, saying I had been abused all my life and how dare they ignore that she kicked in my bolt locked door and etc.. the officers just sounded pissed that they had to take a different angle at the situation


An officer came over to me and asked me what gun I pointed at my sister. I lied to them. I told them I pointed a BB gun at my sister. I didnt. I pointed a shotgun at her.


My sister told them I threatened her with a shotgun. They said it was my word versus hers, and that if it was the shotgun, I would be charged with something or another


Well.. my mom stepped in. She said i always tell the truth and that I wouldnt have done it. She took my side even though I was lying. I could see my sister break down emotionally all over again even through her bloodied face. The police decided to go with my side of the story and literally nothing happened.


No charges. No arrest. My sister had a deviated septum and I wouldnt be blown away if i caused brain damage. But literally there were no consequences. I still dont understand why I wasnt arrested when I had obviously beat the absolute shit out of her


---------


So... Yeah. Long story I guess.


Im 21 now.. that was when I was 15. She moved out shortly after that and is dying of hepatitis in another state now. I probably should feel bad for her, but I dont. I forgive her but I dont think I will ever feel empathy for her.


Im so glad I was never charged though. That would have ruined my chances at a nursing career. I'm two years into nursing school, and despite my abuse, I think I am doing okay in life.

I probably sound all dark and edgy. Sorry guys. Im really a nice guy I think. I just cant get this out of my mind today. I think i just needed to get that memory off of my mind.

The first time, I heard lots of loud yelling, screaming, and crying. It was only the woman crying. I could also hear furniture and objects moving around loudly so I called the police. They came and as far as I'm aware, they spoke to the woman (I think the man had left the apartment by the time the police arrived).

Yesterday I heard them fighting again but this time it sounded like the situation had escalated. I definitely heard someone get slapped and based on what I could hear them saying (in Spanish), it was the woman who was slapped. She kept yelling ""respect me! Don't hurt me!"" over and over. It was extremely distressing. Called the police again and within 30 minutes I could see the cop outside my neighbour's building's door. A few minutes later the policeman calls me and says nobody is opening the door but 3 second later he says ""nevermind, someone's opened up"" and that was that/

This morning the police calls me again and says that they couldn't find the apartment yesterday. They went to the right address but couldn't find the right apartment within the building. There are max 3 apartments/flats in that building so I find this really surprising. The police said they will try and find them again today but I find it so strange that they couldn't find the apartment because 2 weeks ago they could. It's like the police aren't making a note of these things.

Anyway, I'm just wondering... is there anything else I can do in this situation to help? I've already recorded a couple of their fights on voice notes (the police seem to have no interest in this) and called the police twice. But if I keep hearing this woman getting abused, is there anything else I can do? Do I just keep calling the police? I fear for her safety and not to make this about me but it's extremely distressing to overhear domestic violence and feel like there's nothing I can do to help. The couple that I hear fighting speak Spanish and so do I... not sure if that's relevant but thought I'd mention it. I don't know this couple personally and I haven't even seen them.

The screenshots really showed me the true side of her and I want nothing to do with her anymore, besides she will always take her own sons side. We have kids and she has never wanted to see them/ hangout with him up until my husband went to jail. I feel like she just comes over to get information and pretends like she understands me.

We are almost 2 years into the 3 year domestic violence restraining order/ sole custody to mom order granted january of 2019 (as there was a lot of physical violence). He began to physically (home and work) and cyber stalk me. I called police multiple times and made reports, they claimed they couldnt find him so it was dismissed (including a time he said I was being held captive and beat in my house to the point where a fucking police team almost knocked down my door, he got away with it). In august 2019 he summoned me to court to change the custody order, a judge denied it because he made no moves to start/finish court appointed tasks. (a 52 week batterer class and a grip of other stuff) during that hearing, I submitted a lot of evidence proving he was still a threat and none of it was addressed. After the court date, the stalking became so much I LITERALLY MOVED OUT OF TOWN for the safety of myself and my kids. All hes been doing since October 2019 is cyber stuff to which I ignore because he didnt know where I was. Got some messages yesterday from a new burner account of his. I usually just brush these off but he literally told me he worked for UPS and then told me my location, when I have made sure not to tell ANYONE. I'm constantly begging and pleading with him to leave me alone. I'm waiting on a couple calls back, so I thought I'd ask the good ol people of reddit, what can I expect out of this? I'm at the prime age of dumb fuck 19 and have no clue what to prepare myself for. Can I take this to court to prove further harassment? What good would that do me? Would this get me anywhere? God almighty, what the hell is gonna happen with my kids one this order is up? I've never thought about terminating his rights and I dont even know if its an option but considering we are almost 2 years into this and nothing has changed, I dont know what to do. I'm unsure how to post pictures on here so I'll type each text he sent (just for clarity and severity purposes-as to whether I can do anything) 

""Just so you know I'm taking care of the DV classes. We will have a court date soon. Also you're welcome for paying that child support check. You got $332 but I got 1350 and when I'm finished I'll be able to have my sons back in my life..

This is my first personal post to a forum like this in a really long time. I've always been made fun of and attacked for not having the textbook, loving relationship with my mom. This has made it really difficult to ask for help from anyone, as I'm used to my feelings being rejected. I'm in college now, but I've had this issue for my entire life. I live with my mom--my dad passed when I was young so its been the two of us for a really long time. She works a high-stress job and has always expected me to take school as seriously as she does her work. This means never hanging out with my friends after school if I don't want her calling and texting me a million times. If it were up to her, I'd be chained to a desk doing work 24/7 with a gag in my mouth. In middle school I was bullied to the point of self harm but she never even made an attempt to address the problem, saying that I was only 'being a baby' because I didn't want to do more work. When I told her what I was doing to myself she fully didn't believe me, calling me a pussy. I was 13. This attitude has persisted. Whenever other people are around us, she pretends as if we have this caring relationship when the reality is we really don't. She's good at acting as if it's true, so when we're at dinner with her friends and she says all these things about how hard I work all it does is make my blood boil. She calls me nicknames that she makes up on the spot and sends me looks as if she actually expects me to do the same. I'm not sure how sick in the head she is: i don't know if she actually believes that I love her or if this is all manipulation of me and her friends. The one person who's believed me is our neighbor, but even she only believed me when I was old enough for her to and when I had been telling her about the abuse for years on end. Whenever people leave the two of us alone, she goes on tirades about how I've failed her. I admit it's not just her that is nasty towards me, now that I'm older I know what she's doing is wrong and I call hr out on it. Probably not in the best ways, but I promise you I would never reciprocate the same energy she's sent my way. I've shown up to school with bruises more times than I can count and no one has ever thought twice about it or said anything to me. She's threatened me with her boyfriends and co-workers, saying that if I don't comply she's gonna get her boyfriend to beat me. People tell me I'm outgoing and confident, so I'm sure it's easy for people to laugh about the problems I have with my mom, believing that I'm exaggerating to be funny. A couple years ago I posted on socials that I got kicked out of the house on a school night in the middle of winter, and all the responses were ""haha epic"". I've convinced myself that the only reaction people will have to me talking about my mom issues is either laughter or disgust because that's been 99% of the responses. Whenever I bring up how she's treated me to her face, she denies everything. She even denies me hurting myself, she denies ever hitting me. This has driven me to the point of insanity. I know that she's never going to change so I need to find better ways of handling her. I've never had a conversation with someone who's had a similar experience but I'm hoping posting this will help me with that. I know there're people like me out there, I wish I had an easier time talking about it so that I could find them. I don't want my horrible relationship and experiences with her to carry over into other aspects of my life as I become an adult and move away. I have a really hard time dealing with her and she ruins a lot of my days. I wish I knew how to prevent her from doing this to me. I know that my anger towards her won't just go away if I move away and never respond to her, I have to process and heal. If anyone has advice on how to lessen her affect on me and how to process traumatizing childhood events I would appreciate it. Also, if there are more specific forums surrounding familial abuse I'm really looking to find support for this.

This is a throwaway and I'll change small insignificant details to keep myself safe.

He is a little older than me but really immature. Hes so angry, all the time. The smallest things, an argument over me dropping a tiny bit of food can end up in him threatening to throw furniture at me.
I know its totally wrong. We bought a new house recently and I've had food and drink thrown over me, totally humiliating although it doesn't hurt.

I'm a stay at home worker with the stuff thats going on at the minute. He's not. I clean daily, cook everything including his meals for the night shifts he works.

But he says I do nothing. Just accuses me daily of playing on the Xbox all day (I definitely do not. 1 hour at most, or not at all). 

I'm feisty too and not one to take loads of abuse but it gets so out of hand and he either threatens me, throws things at me or breaks stuff and has hurt me before. He once pulled me round the garden by my hair and I lost chunks of it. 

So why do I feel no anger once it's done? Why am I so forgiving, and just want to love him and be loved? Cos when things are good they're awesome and about 10 mins after hes finished being like that I just want things to be fine and theres never any hard feelings on my part. I'm totally in love and just want to get on with stuff. Thats not normal is it, but I cant shake it off.

Also sometimes I feel guilty because of things I said or did when retaliating or to protect myself. I once kicked out at him because I was scared and caused a nasty bruise. Thats makes me feel like I cant tell anyone because I've done wrong too.

I tell him i go shoping , then i sneak to the DV advocates office, 
When i met her, i tell her about everything,, and she said i must leave him , i said i’m not ready, because i still believe in him, he will change for me, i want good marriage, and i want once marriage for forever,,,have a family,,, 

Second visit i arrange with DV advocate, and still same i answer i not ready to leave,,,because “i love him”

After 6 months from my last visit to DV advocate, it’s normal day, after work, i cleaning, laundry, cooking,,
When i hang laundry (he help me hang the laundry) he found out that his note inside his shorts is damage, he start being furious to me,, call me “fucking moron” “what an idiot” “useless cunt” ,, over the note :(
He start lock me in the laundry room, then he go through my phone for checking if i message anyone,, i scream “help help” no one hear me,, i just crying,, not crying because i am hurt physically , but i am crying because i am hurt inside,, mentally hurt :(( ,,,, this is my husband,, he supposed to protect me,, love me,, comfort me,,, makes me happy,,, but he is not :((

Then for 30 mins im crying in the room,, he let me out,, he not allow me sleeping on the bed “if i found out in the morning you sleeping on the bed, i will punch your fcking face”

God, was she charming. She swept me off my feet the moment we met, I don't usually fall for people 

but she had everything I liked. She was tall (6ft) and butch and I was smitten by her protectiveness and how she treated me. 

She bought me dinners (I never paid for a single thing, she wouldn't let me pay or even tip myself), jewelry, clothes, took me out, just all that kind of stuff. It was a first to me to have someone treat me so... I don't know like I was special. She made me feel special. It was ok at first. 

Then at home one day she's talking about work, complaining about something, and I made a sarcastic quip about the situation. Don't even remember what I said, next thing I know I'm holding onto the side of my face because she's smacked me across my cheek. I just kinda sat there shocked and asked 

if she really just hit me, she said she didn't mean to hit me that hard. I didn't know what to do so I just said it was ok, it was a mistake and a one time thing, we went to bed. 

My life changed after that night. She became demanding, scary, intimidating. I'm 5'3 140lbs, she was 6' and little over 300lbs, so she constantly used her large frame to back me into corners while berating me over something I said or did, restraining me if I ever tried to get away, pinning me against walls to show she was stronger than I was. Stuff like that. 

One bad night we went to a bar, I went to the patio to smoke and another woman followed me and started hitting on me, asking to buy me another drink. I was explaining I was here with someone when my girlfriend walked out and flipped the fuck out. She walked over and I guess her look or something sent the other woman scurrying away, while I began to be yelled at about being a lying, cheating whore (the usual go to). 

I was tired that night so I got up and walked away, out of the bar while figuring out how the fuck I was going to get home. She of course followed me, and I blame myself for letting her pull me into an alley. I should have stayed in view of other people. Well she screamed at me some more, wouldn't 

stop grabbing me and she finally pushed too hard and I stumbled backwards and smashed my face into the cement wall and suddenly I found myself spitting out one of my teeth as it was cracked and broken by the impact. 

I still fucking stayed. I started crying and she hugged me and apologized, we went home and I just laid in bed while she did whatever she wanted to me and waited for her to be done and fall asleep so I could just cry into my pillow. 

It became all the time. The hits became routine. Around her friends (I was not allowed to speak to my friends cause the me being a whore and all) she would make fun of me for being mentally ill, that I was so stupid I had to drop out of college, she had to take care of me, ect ect. If I said something she didn't like she'd pinch me and twist (like sitting at the table she could pretend to pat my thigh while really she was punishing me for what I said). 

She quickly learned the key was not to hit me in the face or choke me because that leaves bruises where people could see. So my chest/ribs, lower back, and legs were all fair game. 

I never realized others noticed when I was once again explaining walking awkwardly because I fell (again), or ran into a door (again), or slipped in the shower. The excuses were bullshit to everyone but they whispered to each other never asked if I was ok. 

She convinced me to get off my meds for my bipolar disorder. She told me she liked me manic 

because I was better in bed. So I stopped, my depression became worse, I was becoming more isolated and had no one to talk to, and my anxiety was at it's worst in my life.

But I didn't tell anyone what was going on. I felt like I deserved it. I hated myself, so it seemed fitting to be hit and degraded since I was so self loathing. 

Then someone did reach out. 

I got a text from an unknown person, asking if she had the right number. I said yes, who is this? 

They wouldn't tell me who they were, just they were friends with my girlfriend and they thought something was going on. She or he told me they had been in an abusive relationship in the past and every time they saw me with my partner they could see something was up. They also informed me she was making fun of me (like were teenagers not in our mid 20's) to her group of friends. 

Apparently, she would mock my depression and said I was nasty, that I threatened to kill myself if she left me, that I pulled out my hair, cut myself for attention, discussed our bedroom activities and showed pictures I had sent her sexting in the past. 

I was humiliated. But it was the last straw, I don't know what clicked but I realized I needed to get the fuck out, this needed to end now. 

So while she was at work I gathered all my things and left, went back to my parents home, and just sat in one of the bedrooms crying for hours and throwing up because I was terrified she was going to come after me. She sent me some vile texts and I eventually had to block her on everything as she was harassing the fuck out of me. 

The things I trusted her enough to tell her, like being raped as a child, was all used against me. She told anyone who would listen the things I told her in confidence. But I wasn't mad, I was numb. So what? I asked myself, I could easily disprove or correct the things she was saying so I thought screw her. 

I told my psych what had been going on and he was very supportive, told me I was worth more than someone abusing me, I didn't deserve it, he was just really nice about it. He didn't make me feel like it was my fault and that felt good. Hell, it just felt good telling someone what had been going on since I had bottled it up for over a year.

I'm back on meds now and in a lot better place than I was just three months ago. I'm working on coping with substance abuse (being drunk made being hit not hurt as badly, and I preferred being able to pass out while she used my body how she wanted in bed) and it's a struggle but without being abused and scared all the time I think I might be able to work on that now. 

I know this was a long rambling rant but I just am so bewildered why I put up with the abuse for so 

long. I'm a victims advocate, I've helped others escape abuse from partners (it's really rampant in the 

LGBT community, just not talked about as much), but I couldn't leave myself because she broke me 

down. I still think sometimes it all happened to another person, as I don't know who that person was 

who was playing the victim role.

I don't know where this is going so I'm going to end this here. Thanks for listening/reading. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to see red flags before it gets too bad? This is now the second partner in my life who has turned abusive, although this one was the worst by far, but I really feel like I am to blame since this keeps happening.

I am a new landlord and my new tenants are generating multiple complaints from the neighbors regarding extremely loud and aggressive fights in the front yard of the house. 1 of the parties is aggressive and the other is not. Both of the parties are in the lease. 

I have not discussed with the tenants yet because I don’t know how. This type of disturbance may violate provisions of the lease that call for “quiet enjoyment of the neighbors”, although I feel strongly that attempting to evict the whole household would be harmful to the victim.

My wife was on the downhill of an abusive marriage when we met.  Initially we were just friends, but I made her feel better, so she could take more of his abuse but also stand up for herself more.  He had stopped being physically violent by that point, he's 6'3 265+, so for him it was more verbal and punching walls or threats since he had established he could best her up anytime he just had to remind her.

She hid most of it, but I became a huge issue for them and I got used to him calling to threaten me ect once she grew numb.

Fast forward a few years, she left, eventually we got married, good times.  But they had joint custody and he started back up, screaming at her (after convincing  her she couldn't record), threatening and intimidating ect.  It escalated into stalking while I was deployed and that's when she finally told me the whole history and it clicked just how violent he could get.  Cops wouldn't take it seriously (NC isn't too progressive), and I started learning how little the system knows about its own laws.  I got smarter, but it takes FOREVER to build a case on someone who now knows they are being watched, dozens of reports, cops know him it's just waiting for a big blowup now.  The assumption is I'm here to protect her now, problem is they also tell me how fast I'll get arrested for doing it.

Brings us to today.  We show up to drop her daughter off, in the police station parking lot like always.  Ex gets out with his mom.  Daughter walks over to grandma, they go to get in his van.  He's still standing there.  I say nothing, no eye contact, wait until my wife is in the car, and as I'm getting in he starts coming towards us.  I pull out my phone, start trying to record and he starts bowing up saying he wants to fight ect.  She's yelling how rediculous this is, tells me to just go.  His mom grabs him, we pull off.

Wife doesn't stop yelling though because......

SHE IS YELLING AT ME!!! 

Now shes mad because she thinks I instigated it.  Same guy that called to cancel her daughters counseling appointment yesterday, same guy who immediately started blowing her phone up about me today being there, like I always am, on and on.

She knows he's dangerous and violent, and uses any excuse to not let their daughter call (1 call on his time a month, maybe) but when does reality set in for her that what he's doing is controlling and he wants to isolate her, so trying to get along with him is a no win game.  He has repeatedly tried to lure her out alone for various reasons and even shown up at times when he doesn't think I'll be there.

My father has been emotionally abusing my mother for a while now, with offs and ons, but it always resorts back to him emotionally abusing my mother. I do not wish to go into much detail, but everyone in my family (mother, myself, sister) have politely told our father how he constantly emotionally abuses my mother. At this point, it is impossible to speak to him, as no matter what you will say, no matter how polite, any constructive criticism you give him will result in him blaming you for ""attacking"" him. He will constantly start screaming at my mother when she is asking questions that a normal wife would ask her husband, like ""Hey I saw you went out for a bit, where did you go?"" in the politest, kindest manner possible. No matter what she does, says, anything, he screams at her constantly.

My family is in the lower middle class. We live in an apartment that is by far the cheapest in my area, and we cannot afford to separate. My mother works tirelessly at her job throughout the day, only to have to clean the house, clean up my father's messes, deal with his emotional abuse, care for her children. There are little opportunities for different places that we can move into. My sister is in college, and it is already hard enough to pay for that, let alone move out and go through all of the costs to do that. Since school is currently online due to COVID-19, internet is a necessity and that threatens to go away based on its cost. 

My father cannot be trusted with money. As a child, I would obtain birthday and Christmas money, and I would often save it up for years at a time, just for my father to ""borrow"" hundreds of dollars and never pay it back. He is an untrustworthy, lying, quick-to-anger, self-centered, emotionally abusing man.

Another problem is our dog. We were lucky enough to make an agreement with our landlords to even have a dog in the first place, and it will be hard to find a place that will allow dogs. We would also need to be able to afford to move our stuff.  We will also be paying for my college after next year.

This is not to say he still isn't abusive because he is, it just isn't nearly as often. It might be once a year or so.

He has beaten me, my mother, and my siblings. Mainly when we were younger but once we got older we would always step in to defend our mother and we would just kind of get hit because we were in the middle. My sister claims that he has denied that I ever even experienced any of his abuse. However, everything is so real and I was there and endured his abuse for my whole childhood. He also drinks a lot and got arrested for drunk driving last year. However, he is a functioning alcoholic and never misses a day of work because of it. He is our main provider and always has been, but in the past, he has used that to his advantage by threatening us if we ever called the police. 

I do love him. and I care for him and I want him to apologize and sincerely mean it. I am just not sure how to address this or have a conversation with him about the way his abuse has made me feel. Our family has never had this conversation. It's as if we always ignore the fact that he would become a monster at night and terrorize our home.

My infancy was good; I was held a lot by my parents and my mom stayed home all day with me. Both of my parents have said I was a very happy and giggly baby and a joy to be around. This was all going to change, however.

When I was a year old, we got evicted from our apartment and moved in with my grandparents. My parents’ marriage crumbled and my dad had to move out. He looked at me sleeping in my crib that day, knowing he had to leave, expecting to never see me again. Through my childhood I was told my dad didn’t want to raise me anymore and it was also implied to be due to me being diagnosed with Autism.

I was diagnosed with Autism and put through ABA inspired therapies in order to function as normally as possible. My grandmother especially pushed me to make eye contact and let people hug me, no matter how I felt. I couldn’t appear to be a rude child to anyone she knew, so I let people do it. 

When I was in after school daycare, I was told by the workers that I had to share my toys with other children. It went as far as the workers allowing other children to take stuff from me/not punishing them if they did.

By the time I got to my teen years, my grandmother was still washing me in the bath when I stayed over. I had been pushing her to let me bathe on my own since I hit puberty but she refused to allow it. She thought that due to my Autism, I was incapable of bathing. She used the same rationale to justify dressing me and helping me into bathing suits long after I was capable.

I got involved with two internet predators, both of whom consumed my life. Both of them would require me to keep in constant contact, preventing me from developing a social life. 

I dated a man whose mother was especially abusive towards me. She would yell at me, threaten me, and treat me like a small child. Her son rarely ever defended me against her and often said I deserved it.

My next partner was no better. We were long distance and he was sexually aggressive very early on, demanding that I send him sexual pictures. This eventually became videos, which had to happen weekly minimum. He used sex as a punishment for any and all infractions. If I said the wrong thing, took too long coming home, or didn’t tell him about a purchase I made, he would punish me by forcing me to get naked over Skype. I would be forced to finger myself or do whatever he told. I had to inflict pain on myself for his own pleasure.

I visited him last year and his attitude towards me changed. A couple days into the visit, he got angry with me for fidgeting too much in my sleep. He spent the morning yelling at me and then apologized. He took me out for coffee to try to “repair our bond”

A few days later, I went to bed at around 2 in the morning. He was still awake so he continued to watch TV for another few minutes. He eventually came to bed and started touching me while I was trying to sleep. He felt me up under my clothes and tried to have sex with me, despite me trying to sleep. I asked him to please stop and told him I wanted to sleep. He said no and continued to touch me, also starting to remove my clothes. I started to cry and pleaded with him to stop. He got angry with me and told me to go into the bathroom. I got up and sat on the floor in his bathroom for probably 20 minutes until he grabbed me and pushed me to his bed.

Once he got me to the bed, he said he was going to give me something to cry about. He pushed me down and pulled my bottoms off. He forced himself inside me and thrusted as hard as he could. I asked him to please stop but he continued even harder. He continued for around 15 to 20 minutes as I cried, frozen. He suddenly stopped and apologized. I stayed unable to move until I coaxed myself into pulling my pants up. He said he would never do it again and I just lay there, still frozen. I did not sleep well that night.

On another occasion, we got into an argument. After yelling at me and telling me I was nothing but an arrogant brat, he placed his hands on my neck. He pressed down and choked me for a minute. Not long enough for me to lose consciousness, but long enough to let me know who was in charge. I knew then he could kill me if he wanted to.

I am pleased to say I am doing better now. My rapist and I have split up and I am now with a lovely man. He knows about all of my trauma and never uses it against me. Now, when I cry, instead of being told I’m stupid or spoiled, I get cuddles and love. My boyfriend allows and encourages me to go for walks, to have friends, etc. He’s been there through the hard times and the easy times.

I'm in a situation where from the time I was born up until I was around 16, my dad was heavily physically abusive to me, my mom, and my little brother. When I say that, I mean fits that lasted upwards of three to six hours where he would throw all of us against walls, grab our jaws so hard that it hurt to eat for several days, pull our hair, throw us on the floor and kick us, tackle us to the floor, jump on top of us and scream and spit in our face, and at times, beat our bodies with his fists. I was constantly hiding bruises at school, I remember at least one occasion where my mom hid her black eye with sunglasses from the repairman fixing our sink, and oftentimes I the abuse was so heavy I thought my dad might not realize his own strength and would accidentally kill me. I lived in constant terror.

As you can imagine, I was heavily traumatized as a kid. To make matters worse, my parents also raised me in an extremely strict religious cult, and because of the rules (particularly regarding clothing &amp; appearance), I was heavily mocked, bullied, and rejected at school and nearly every other social situation I have ever been in. When I was 12, my parents pulled me out of school because I was cutting myself (I didn't do this for attention; I did it on my thighs, which were covered at all times even in the summer due to the dress code rules, but my mom walked in on me changing), and they thought the bullying was the cause of it. Basically, they homeschooled me, except they both worked full time, so I was pretty much left alone in the house, and nearly the only social situation interaction I got until I began college was when I went to the cult church, where most of the people were mean and bullied me.

During my childhood years, my mom took 24 hours a semester and rushed to get 8 yrs of school done in 3.5 yrs, along with several certifications. What I watched her go through was brutal and intense; I watched her have so many meltdowns getting through all that school while raising my brother and I, but she was scared it might get to a point that she would have to flee for our lives, and she was terrified she wouldn't be able to support us. She went from having a few hours at a community college from years ago to being a highly educated professional and working as a controller, and making a decent amount more financially than my dad does. When that happened, she stood up to him and stopped the hours long fits and physical abuse.

Basically, I'm in a situation where the physical abuse and emotional manipulation, the years of isolation, and the bullying have created a cocktail where I'm struggling to be mentally stable, though I've mostly dealt with this by being a perfectionist. I was not educated well during the years I was isolated, however, I was already so far ahead because my parents had high standards and began teaching my brother and I upper level math in elementary, so I was able to get into community college early and didn't struggle with math until I hit pre-cal. I was always made to read a lot, too, so I tended to excel in the non-math courses. As a youth, to cope with my pain, I embraced the fantasy of being perfect, and I ended up doing things like getting up at 4 AM to work out amd teaching myself to speak a second language fluently. However, I struggle with bulimia, it's better now, but it was horrible for years, I have really bad OCD and compulsions, and while I got on Lexapro for the first time in February and it's absolutely changed my life, all the flashbacks and things I'm dealing with still make it really hard to cope.

Anyway, my parents are better now that my dad doesn't physically abuse me, but my parents are still heavily emotionally manipulative and it takes a toll on me. Tonight, they yelled at me for something I never said for five hours; I'm not exaggerating. I begged them that I just wanted to go; I'm always respectful to them. They literally ran around the room, threw things like a chair and a dip machine, my mom threw two iron weights against the floor so hard they broke, they screamed at the top of their lungs, and all of the emotional manipulation and twisted logic was just a lot. Now that I'm on anxiety meds and my boyfriend has come into my life and has actually pointed out bow twisted their logic is and validated my feelings/assured me that their insults to me are unfounded, I cope better, but it still hurts, and tonight left me so exhausted and drained. I cried to the point I was dehydrated. 

But, my problem is, back to my perfectionism, I set my sights on medical school a few years ago because I thought it would give me self worth, but I've actually come to love medicine. I'm going to be a senior after I finish my summer classes, I've gotten through most of the more difficult classes and have a high GPA, and with all the research I've done on GPA, the MCAT, ECs, etc., I genuinely believe I'll be able to get in. My parents are very financially generous, and they're paying for everything, including my education (even though I try to offer to pay for things, they won't let me). My mom is extremely controlling; she called my boss a month after I was fired for something minor where a lot of other employees agreed the boss had it out for me, but it was whatever, and chewed the boss out. That humiliated me. The idea of a parent calling their nearly 21 year old child's boss a month after that child was let go is so inappropriate and embarrassing, but both parents believe that's their right as parents because they pay the bills. My mom found out I lost my virginity last year, and she is mad I haven't apologized to her for that. I lied and said I only had sex with my boyfriend one time and am not sexually active, but she treats my boyfriend like trash now and hates him even though he's an amazing guy, and she loved him before she knew that. She was extremely angry when she found out I was in his bedroom this weekend, even though it was daytime and his parents were right outside in the living room. She questions me on everything, her control exhausts me. I spend several hours a day doing chores, I'm highly responsible, don't drink, smoke, use drugs, etc., am very respectful and don't back talk, but she will not stop seeing me as a child.

So, I have one year left until I'm done with my bachelor's. I'm scared my GPA might drop if I have to work full time while I'm taking classes like O-Chem 2, and I also need to study for the MCAT. The fact that they're paying for everything, and I don't have to pay my own way makes it easier to shadow, research, etc. I'm already on the home stretch, and I know that if by some chance I didn't get into medical school, I'd be stuck with a biology degree I can't do a lot with, and I'd have to give up my dream. I don't know what to do. It sounds silly that I legitimately fear they might beat me again some day. I keep my phone with me, so I can call 911 if that were to happen. I hate having that kind of fear in my own house. But I'm so scared of striking out on my own and not getting in and being screwed.

What would you all do in this situation? Try to hold out and keep a phone close by in case anything happens? I don't think my life is in danger, but I do think I could be decently injured (I don't predict it, but it wouldn't surprise me). They put their hands on me forcefully now, especially my mom, but they don't abuse me. Are there options where I could move out and get into medical school, too? Could I take out loans? My parents have access to my bank account and would take that, my phone, and my car. I'm going to start my own bank account for my next job and hope they don't say anything, but if I were to strike out right now, I'd essentially have nothing to my name.

He was emotionally, physically, financially and spiritually abusive towards both of them from a young age (12, he is now 20). He suffers from being bipolar, manic depressive which often result mood swings and violent outbursts and also addiction issues with drugs and alcohol. 

Late last year they were both forced to kick him out of their home and put a restraining order on him after one of his outbursts, where he pushed my SO through the conservatory door, nearly bringing the door down on top of her. He had at that point also punched several holes in the plasterboard of their home and threatened both her and her mother physically and self-harmed i89with a piece of glass in front of them. It got to the point where the police were called and he had to be arrested and detained for 24 hours. 

I also am aware that whilst living with them, he stole from his mother and her continuously and was very controlling around his mothers comings and going.

This isn't the only outburst there has been where something like this has happened and not the first time he has made an attempt on his life. 

I don't know if its worth mentioning but the father has never really been around. Their mother and he divorced when my gf and her brother were very young and never really made an effort to be in their lives afterwards, only seeing them every few months, turning up drunk, or leaving them alone to go to the pub, drug addictions, and generally just being a spiteful and mean person, etc.

Im trying to be there for both of them as best as i can but I've never had this conversation before and know very little about the topic. I've done some research myself already but there's so much out there that i don't know where to begin. Could anyone send me some links to useful articles or sites or ted talks?

Alex has been having really loud arguments with their partner ('Taylor'), has been screaming at them, crying, shouting abuse at them, and often throws things. They have since taken a 'relationship break' - Alex and Taylor are still talking but are not broaching emotional topics that could lead to arguments or having sexual discussions. They agreed that they are no longer 'dating' but may revisit a relationship once they can see each other in person again, but also provided some caveats that Alex work on their emotional regulation and Taylor work on their communication.

Alex had been listening to love songs on repeat, looking through old photos, and hasn't been doing any of the work they promised to do on their emotions. They have stated that they can't help their trauma or what triggers them, and they believe that allowances should be made for them. Alex asked for my advice, and I gave it honestly - saying that relationships require compromise and triggers (while valid) can sometimes be irrational. Alex told me that one of their triggers was being controlled, which means they can never compromise. I agreed that controlling behaviour isn't good in a relationship. But I added that if a friend asks you to change something that upsets them, and it doesn't cause too much of an issue for you, it makes sense to try and change that for that friend. (Thinking in my head that Taylor has asked Alex to stop referring to them as derogatory names such as 'b*tch', 'd*ck', and others which are too offensive to type here.) Alex appeared to agree with me and even did some work and chatted to their therapist about it (over video chat).

A few days ago, Alex had a friend sitting outside on the street and we were all having socially distanced drinks. Alex got a bit drunk (on second drink?) and interrupted Alex's friend mid-sentence to shout at me: ""We need to stop this narrative that Alex can't have healthy relationships!"" (Yes referring to themselves in the 3rd person is common.)

It came out of nowhere. I was in the middle of paying for dinner which Alex had chosen and been all to happy to have me pay for.

Me: ""I'm sorry what are you talking about?""

Alex: ""You saying that I can never have healthy relationships is hurtful and unhelpful and it needs to stop!""

Me: ""I never said that you couldn't-""

Alex: ""I don't care. That's what it felt like and it hurts and it needs to stop!""

Me: ""But I never said that and I don't think that. I just said compromise is needed in a relationship. I am not validating what you think I said when I didn't say that and don't think that at all.""

Alex: ""I DON'T CARE!!!! YOU NEED TO STOP!!""

Alex's friend interrupts this and says that we shouldn't have this conversation while drunk. Alex takes a while to calm down but then talks to their friend while I'm sat feeling really afraid and still ordering and paying for dinner.

Alex's friend leaves and Alex goes upstairs and starts shouting on the phone to someone upstairs.

I'm quite afraid because Alex has thrown things at me and 'play hit' me a few times when frustrated (not hard enough to bruise but hard enough to hurt). I had a serious chat with Alex every single time and they keep pushing the boundary, like throwing things at the wall next to my head instead of at me. I've seen how loud and shouty Alex can get while upset, and I know it won't hurt me physically but I don't want to be screamed at or have things thrown at me. I also am concerned that Alex thinks that how what people say makes them feel matters more than what they said (this was a common theme with their arguments with Taylor too) so if I do try and talk about it Alex might not understand what I'm saying or get really really angry at me.

It escalated today. I spoke to my sister at 3pm in my closet in my bedroom and Alex apparently overheard? I've been sat in the living room all evening working on my laptop, when I went in the next room to take a call from my other sister.

Alex messaged me: Hey gal, if you’re going to have calls about me you’ll need to either go elsewhere to have them or keep your voice down And also if you need to move out then go ahead

Me: I'm talking about graduation photos?

Alex: Earlier you weren't.  I don’t know or care what you’re talking about now

Me: Okay

Alex:  But earlier really upset me, and instead of stewing I’m going to tell you  And tell you in future not to say hurtful things so loudly 

Me: I'm actually good thanks. Cool will do.

Alex: *thumbs up*

It turns out that Alex asked Taylor if anyone would have reason to be scared of Alex getting violent when angry or upset and Taylor had to remind Alex that Taylor had been hit, slapped, and had things thrown at them when Alex was upset. But that doesn't seem to be the answer Alex was looking for.

It started small I guess. When I was really young we were like normal, hateful siblings. She would call me names. I would do things to spite her. I guess that was all how it was supposed to be at the time.


Elementary school was different. My mom worked until late at night, no dad in the picture. My sister would chase me around the house and beat me. She would ridicule and insult me the moment I left my room, like some sort of obsession.


As she got older, she became increasingly hostile toward me. She would attack me and chase me to my room, where I would close the door and lock it behind me. She learned to ""pick"" those easy house knobs, so I spent a lot of my elementary school home time with one hand on the door lock and the other hand playing with legos. I vividly remember my counselor asking if my mother tried to hurt me because of the bruises on my body. Thats another story though.


When I got into middle school, she moved on from abusing me. She got into drugs and began to abuse my family instead. My possessions were stolen, scary men came in and out of the house at night and my mother was an emotionally shattered husk. I just became hateful and numb.


I guess thats a really concise way to summarize a lifetime of abuse. There is so much to say, I just wanted to get you caught up.



--------------------------
**The story you probably came for:**


I was 15. I was laying on my bunkbed listening to music on my little speaker set. My phone was connected through an aux cord. I wish that detail didnt matter.


My sister was walking around the house. I could hear the floorboards creeking. I wasnt afraid, but her presence in the house always made me have some primal sense of alertness and anxiety. I was listening to the floorboards and approximating her position in the house, something I did normally.


At some point, she came into my room. This already put me on alert - she usually avoided my room. She just came in and started looking around my room. 


She focused in on my phone and my speaker set and scowled at them. ""You have an aux cord?""


""Yeah,"" I replied, ""just one of those cheap ones so I can connect my phone"" (I was always trying to downplay and mitigate conflict)


She replied with ""I want an aux cord"", followed by an awkward silence. 


I dont know what to say. She isnt getting my aux cord. ""Yeah mom and I found it at goodwill"".


She was examining the cord. ""Mom never gets me nice things.""


I dont know what to say, again. Luckily though, she walked out of the room.


As she walks out of my room and into the hallway, I hear her continuing to speak. It sounds like she is complaining, but I cant make out what she is saying. As she walks down the hallway away from my room, she starts to get louder. It gets to a point where she is screaming something at me from the other side of the house.


I am trying to avoid conflict. I go to my door and I shut it and lock both the door and the *bolt lock* that was installed on my door to protect me from her.


I hear the floorboards again, accompanied by further loud complaints. She is walking back to my room.


She stops at my door and turns the knob. She is obviously pissed that I locked it. ""Open the door.""


I figure with the bolt lock, Im in a position of power. She can fuck right off. ""No. I'm not fighting with you. Please leave.""


She continues. ""Open. The. Door.""


""No. I'm not opening it.""


""Open the fucking door.""


I just dont reply. I tend to lock up when I dont know what to say.


There is a moment of silence. My heart is beating out of my chest.


Suddenly, **BANG**, she kicks the fucking door! Adrenaline shoots through me. She kicks the door again. ""OPEN THIS FUCKING DOOR NOW"".


I dont know what to do. I text my mom. I know she cant help. She keeps kicking the door. The door is holding great. So glad I have a bolt lock.


She stops. I feel instantly relieved. Im thinking to myself that she must have tired herself out... But I dont hear the floorboards. She hasnt left, she is still in front of the door.


Im waiting for her to leave when she starts kicking the door again. She is shouting, but I cant understand what she is saying. I can hear the wood of the door being stressed and I start panicking


I had a shotgun under my bed. It wasnt loaded. I pulled it out and I pointed it at the door. 


I shouted ""(Sister), dont fucking come in here! I have a gu-"" and the door crashes open. The bolt lock has broken right through the frame of the door, which has been splintered. My sister is standing on the other side of the door watching me


**So here I am, pointing a unloaded shotgun at my sister, hoping to use it to bluff her off. *But she takes a step forward***.


(Sister): ""What are you going to do, shoot me?"" She takes another step toward me


""Do it! Fucking shoot me, (slur)! Shoot me!"" She takes another step foward.


""(Slur) (slur)! Fucking kill me!"" Another step


Suddenly she starts sprinting at me, screaming. 


What happened is a blur in my memory, but the next thing I know, I have her pinned to the wall outside my room and the shotgun has scratched a long line in the floor from being thrown down the hallway


Adrenaline was pumping through me. My heart was beating harder than I had ever felt before. She was kicking me. I felt nothing at all. No pain. 


I grabbed her by her throat. I remember her making this terrible choking sound and scratching at her neck. With my other hand, god, forgive me, I just started beating her. I had never fought anyone, I had never thrown a real punch, I had never done anything like that.


Its hard to describe, but it felt like something primal took over. I really just started beating her. Beating her as hard as I could. She was resisting and I just pushed her against the wall harder and beat her more. I was screaming in her face. Screaming about how she was the reason my mother is suicidal, and she is the reason that I camt be happy and..


I have this image burned into my mind, I stopped hitting her for a moment and I just remember there being blood on the wall next to her face and her nose just oozing blood, and I expect to see a look of pain on her face..


.. but.. she just smiled at me. This fucking crazy, wicked, demonic smile. I felt like I was beating a literal monster. She smiled at me and I just went back to beating her. I remember her tooth cutting my finger and I remember not feeling it and just continuing to beat her.


It was the most sickening, primal feeling. It was like I lost control. It was like my body wanted her *dead*. I am not a violent person at all but this was something else entirely.


So I beat her and beat her and beat her. At some point I come to my senses and I drop her. She starts screaming the moment I release her and starts hitting my face. 


Right away, like a reflex, I tackled her back up against the wall and I just started beating her again. Again and again and again and again and again. Once again, I had this primal voice telling me to beat her until she died.


I didnt. I dropped her a second time. This time she fell on her ass. She started crying loudly and jumped out of the hallway into the kitchen and ran into her room. I could hear her crying loudly from the hallway.


I went over and picked the shotgun up off the ground and I went in my room. I sat in the corner of the room and I loaded the shotgun. I pointed it at the door and I called 911.



-----------
**Aftermath**


The police came and my mom rushed home. The police were treating it like I was the abuser to my sister - they were talking about how I was going to be charged with some kind of felony assault (dofferent rules for 'domestic violence?') and I was trying to explain myself and they just werent having it at all. 


My mom arrived and started yelling at the officers, saying I had been abused all my life and how dare they ignore that she kicked in my bolt locked door and etc.. the officers just sounded pissed that they had to take a different angle at the situation


An officer came over to me and asked me what gun I pointed at my sister. I lied to them. I told them I pointed a BB gun at my sister. I didnt. I pointed a shotgun at her.


My sister told them I threatened her with a shotgun. They said it was my word versus hers, and that if it was the shotgun, I would be charged with something or another


Well.. my mom stepped in. She said i always tell the truth and that I wouldnt have done it. She took my side even though I was lying. I could see my sister break down emotionally all over again even through her bloodied face. The police decided to go with my side of the story and literally nothing happened.


No charges. No arrest. My sister had a deviated septum and I wouldnt be blown away if i caused brain damage. But literally there were no consequences. I still dont understand why I wasnt arrested when I had obviously beat the absolute shit out of her


---------


So... Yeah. Long story I guess.


Im 21 now.. that was when I was 15. She moved out shortly after that and is dying of hepatitis in another state now. I probably should feel bad for her, but I dont. I forgive her but I dont think I will ever feel empathy for her.


Im so glad I was never charged though. That would have ruined my chances at a nursing career. I'm two years into nursing school, and despite my abuse, I think I am doing okay in life.

I probably sound all dark and edgy. Sorry guys. Im really a nice guy I think. I just cant get this out of my mind today. I think i just needed to get that memory off of my mind.

The first time, I heard lots of loud yelling, screaming, and crying. It was only the woman crying. I could also hear furniture and objects moving around loudly so I called the police. They came and as far as I'm aware, they spoke to the woman (I think the man had left the apartment by the time the police arrived).

Yesterday I heard them fighting again but this time it sounded like the situation had escalated. I definitely heard someone get slapped and based on what I could hear them saying (in Spanish), it was the woman who was slapped. She kept yelling ""respect me! Don't hurt me!"" over and over. It was extremely distressing. Called the police again and within 30 minutes I could see the cop outside my neighbour's building's door. A few minutes later the policeman calls me and says nobody is opening the door but 3 second later he says ""nevermind, someone's opened up"" and that was that/

This morning the police calls me again and says that they couldn't find the apartment yesterday. They went to the right address but couldn't find the right apartment within the building. There are max 3 apartments/flats in that building so I find this really surprising. The police said they will try and find them again today but I find it so strange that they couldn't find the apartment because 2 weeks ago they could. It's like the police aren't making a note of these things.

Anyway, I'm just wondering... is there anything else I can do in this situation to help? I've already recorded a couple of their fights on voice notes (the police seem to have no interest in this) and called the police twice. But if I keep hearing this woman getting abused, is there anything else I can do? Do I just keep calling the police? I fear for her safety and not to make this about me but it's extremely distressing to overhear domestic violence and feel like there's nothing I can do to help. The couple that I hear fighting speak Spanish and so do I... not sure if that's relevant but thought I'd mention it. I don't know this couple personally and I haven't even seen them.

I called police multiple times and made reports, they claimed they couldnt find him so it was dismissed (including a time he said I was being held captive and beat in my house to the point where a fucking police team almost knocked down my door, he got away with it). In august 2019 he summoned me to court to change the custody order, a judge denied it because he made no moves to start/finish court appointed tasks. (a 52 week batterer class and a grip of other stuff) during that hearing, I submitted a lot of evidence proving he was still a threat and none of it was addressed. After the court date, the stalking became so much I LITERALLY MOVED OUT OF TOWN for the safety of myself and my kids. All hes been doing since October 2019 is cyber stuff to which I ignore because he didnt know where I was. Got some messages yesterday from a new burner account of his. I usually just brush these off but he literally told me he worked for UPS and then told me my location, when I have made sure not to tell ANYONE. I'm constantly begging and pleading with him to leave me alone. I'm waiting on a couple calls back, so I thought I'd ask the good ol people of reddit, what can I expect out of this? I'm at the prime age of dumb fuck 19 and have no clue what to prepare myself for. Can I take this to court to prove further harassment? What good would that do me? Would this get me anywhere? God almighty, what the hell is gonna happen with my kids one this order is up? I've never thought about terminating his rights and I dont even know if its an option but considering we are almost 2 years into this and nothing has changed, I dont know what to do. I'm unsure how to post pictures on here so I'll type each text he sent (just for clarity and severity purposes-as to whether I can do anything) 

""Just so you know I'm taking care of the DV classes. We will have a court date soon. Also you're welcome for paying that child support check. You got $332 but I got 1350 and when I'm finished I'll be able to have my sons back in my life..

-also congrats on your new kid. Always knew youd let anyone shoot cum between your legs. I was just the unfortunate one
-see you soon

-I can care less if you talk to me now
now
-I dont expect behavior from someone as immature as you
-cause you will have to deal with me now
-not trying to scare you, just a heads up
-so you can stop running from me cause you're gonna need to know the court case some how
-you created this dont be upset cause you cant clean up your mess
-you knew you could never really get rid of me
-There’s nothing you can say. I have a lady now who’s family took me in and removed the toxic dysfunctional traits that I grew up around. Showing the better way to handle things. I work for ups getting paid 28 and hour
-And the best part is I even pay my child support and that wasn’t enough for you to consider being mature
-But I’ve finally gotten shit for myself but I’ll never be complete with my sons out in *my location*  not knowing who their father is.""
He sent all that before I could even respond to one message. And any message after that is blaming me for the downfall of himself. I screen shot and screen recorded the texts as they came in.

The downs were typically arguments and discussions about boundaries. I’ve worked on not sharing so much of my anxieties and they never really thought they had a problem. 

Recently they have become violent. They threw a bookshelf, some remotes and after that a wooden box down the stairs that they claimed wouldn’t had hit me. I feel overwhelmed and unsafe. 

For over two months I have tried looking for apartments with no luck in my pay bracket (everywhere I go says I don’t make enough, but I don’t qualify for assistance). Insult to injury, I was told after multiple phone calls looking for shelter that I wasn’t poor enough to get help.  I was told after being honest about the $150 I had in my bank to get a hotel. “We can’t help you till you have used all resources.” I don’t know what I am supposed to do.

I always had a hard time hiding my temper when I felt like my ex was stupid when I helped her with her studies. She hated herself during such times, and hated me for making her hate herself. Bad feelings became verbal arguments, and then escalated to her hitting me to let the anger out.

When I initiated the breakup, her very rare violent behaviors soon escalated into full blow. She slapped, bit, threw things at me, pushed me up against the wall, threatened to harm me and my family, and once pointed a knife at me.

I know that she probably has deep-seated problems, but I feel guilty because I feel like my constant put-downs and dissatisfactions in her and in the relationship somehow contributed to her bad mental state and behavior, or at least that's what she told me. She was very sweet and gentle in the beginning, but somehow it turned into this.

So I guess what I wanted to ask was, is the relationship irreversible and can only get worse if somehow we maintain our connection? And am I right in feeling guilty in this, or is her problem only something bigger and I had a very small part to play?

August 2018
I told him i was pregnant. He came to the appointment and had two shots of whiskey after. Handled it well at first. Second Prenatal appointment was awkward, refused prenatal vitamins, no smiles from either of us. He always wrestled me roughly because i was getting rid of it anyway it didnt matter. Asked me why i watched what i ate because it didnt matter. Yelled at me in the regular, avoided me.


I tried to eat a lot of parsley. It didnt work. Aspirin, didnt work. ""You cant clean a house, we arent ready for a baby what would it eat, fucking roaches?"" I cleaned the house hoping maybe i would be ready. Still, no. ""We dont have enough furniture. We need our own place, you're bad at cleaning, we need more time together alone, we need to travel""

Two years later i am still with him and we have bought a house, have furniture, I have a career, we have a car, i clean more now. Seeing a roach gives me that same flashback about why i wasn't good enough to keep my baby.

October 2018 
 i had a surgical abortion at 13 weeks, we had to drive 4 hours and stay over night to make the appointment. I was terrified as i had just gotten my car back after a car accident. I begged him that maybe we could make things work- he said they wouldn't. I covered all the mirrors in the house because i couldn't stand to look at myself, started drinking, defeated alcoholism later on and he hasnt changed a bit.

This post isn't about me; its about my sister. 

About a year ago, my eighteen year old sister brought a guy back to my house (my moms...but still, I live here) and he was alright at first. For the first month or so, he was actually a decent person. However, after that first month, everything flipped upside down. The verbal abuse began little by little. Not knowing the true scope of this abuse - I felt bad for him. He talked about how bad of a life he had, and that he suffers from mental illness. As time went on, he would blame everything on mental illness. We found out my sister was pregnant, and it only made everything so much worse. I decided to hire him at a store I was managing, just for him to mix alcohol and Xanax while on the job, causing him to black out and literally destroy my car while running around almost naked.

I am absolutely terrified that he will put his hands on my sister already. Every night, I hear her screaming and crying, while he is yelling at her while making violent threats towards my family. When we defend my sister, she denies that anything is wrong, while he continues to threaten us in a house that he lives in for free. She refuses to let us kick him out, because that's the father of her child and he apparently took her virginity, she ""loves"" him. I dont want to repeat anything that has been said because it is very triggering. My parents have no idea what is truly going on because they're deaf and can't hear the entiee context of the arguments/abuse. I absolutely cannot handle this anymore. He is SO disrespectful towards my mom - he has even said that he cheated on her because she was signing and driving at the same time?? (She was asking directions so he could sell percocets...) We have screenshots of him threatening us. Now that the baby has been born and hes a few months old, the mental abuse continues. He threatens to take the baby across the country to his family's house on a daily basis, yet leaves my mom, the same person he talks trash about every single day, to take care of the baby while my sister suffers from post partum depression. If he ever leaves, we want to move into a place that he will never find.

What do i do? How do I get him out of the house? We are all terrified of him.

Our relationship is ugly. About a few months into dating, he hit me for the first time. I don't remember the reason why he hit me, as most of the time it is over the smallest of arguments, but it happened. I have a background of child abuse and child sexual abuse and so when he was sincerely apologetic, I forgave him. We have really beautiful highs and terrible lows. There has been countless times where he has forced me to pleasure him, and he has been too rough and would hit me really hard, and wouldn't stop when I wanted him to. He has hit me many times during arguments, and has left me bruised on countless occassions. I've been choked many times, and once he did it while we were in public and going for a walk.

It was dark and there was nobody around except for people in the distance who walked past us and I pretended like nothing was happening.

I’d try to just sleep and he’d rip off the blankets and kick me onto the floor.

Well, we are still texting a few times daily, so I am not technically out of the relationship yet, and perhaps won't for some time. However I am gradually starting to see the abusive patterns in our relationship, and view things as they really were.

I wasn't really wrong when I felt frustrated she couldn't understand it when I explained programming concepts to help her study. I always tried my best to constrain the frustration when teaching her, but she would always pick it out and lash out at me in return. I realize that I wasn't wrong when I repeatedly told her I was having doubts about the relationship, it was an attempt of open communication and it wasn't a sin, or that I was putting her down and deliberately making her feel inadequate. I wasn't really wrong when I wanted out, despite the fact that she followed me to a new country when I gave her a sort of ultimatum (""If you don't come to Canada, we'll have to break up."").

She is trying to layer all these guilt upon me, and even now, I still feel guilty and responsible for the above things I did.

I went back to the island one week ago, because I missed her like hell. I missed her so much that my heart felt weak and my hands trembled. It is funny, how I had been pondering breakup for the majority of the day, but ever since I really went out, I could miss her so much. My emotional dependence on her was undeniable. Every day she waited for me in front of the fireplace. She used to be so happy when I returned, and she would care about my life and health, cook for me, and listen to all the silly and the most out-of-the-world things I had to say. I missed having someone always there for me.

But the bad times, oh they were so bad. Her opinion of me shifts drastically during those episodes where she felt she wasn't ""understood."" She gaslights me (""No I haven't said that"", ""no I didn't do it"", blatantly tells me that my feelings are unimportant to her, tells me I am too needy, that all my future partners will cheat on me because of that, says that me and all my family are psychopaths, and that I won't have any achievements in life, that my pouring out my heart to her made her feel speechless, etc. That I am selfish, fake and have a weak soul.

The days pending the breakup which I initiated were the worst. She blamed me for all her problems, and accused me of not caring about her at all. She slapped, choked, kicked, bit, threw things at me, pushed me up against walls, and once pointed a knife at me. She would stand in front of my room at night with ""that look,"" refused to let me sleep and gave me verbal threats for half an hour, sitting at my bed and staring at the wall. In the daytime she kept talking to herself. I was so scared.

She is normal at most times and in front of others, especially now which is weeks after I left. I know she misses me as well, but not to such an extent as I missed her. She easily closes off her emotions, as she herself said, and according to articles of personality disorders. She would think of me randomly during the day, but I guess that's basically it.

I realize that it's going to be an uphill battle, perhaps filled with loneliness, but also filled with freedom. I know that going back to the island where I used to, and somewhat still, feel like it's a home, isn't the answer to all this. Last time I went, I relived the sweetest times, but then triggered one of her episodes and got slapped, blamed and threatened in return. I won't contemplate going back to her again. She is not likely to change in the following months and even years to come.

My wife was on the downhill of an abusive marriage when we met.  Initially we were just friends, but I made her feel better, so she could take more of his abuse but also stand up for herself more.  He had stopped being physically violent by that point, he's 6'3 265+, so for him it was more verbal and punching walls or threats since he had established he could best her up anytime he just had to remind her.

She hid most of it, but I became a huge issue for them and I got used to him calling to threaten me ect once she grew numb.

Fast forward a few years, she left, eventually we got married, good times.  But they had joint custody and he started back up, screaming at her (after convincing  her she couldn't record), threatening and intimidating ect.  It escalated into stalking while I was deployed and that's when she finally told me the whole history and it clicked just how violent he could get.  Cops wouldn't take it seriously (NC isn't too progressive), and I started learning how little the system knows about its own laws.  I got smarter, but it takes FOREVER to build a case on someone who now knows they are being watched, dozens of reports, cops know him it's just waiting for a big blowup now.  The assumption is I'm here to protect her now, problem is they also tell me how fast I'll get arrested for doing it.

Brings us to today.  We show up to drop her daughter off, in the police station parking lot like always.  Ex gets out with his mom.  Daughter walks over to grandma, they go to get in his van.  He's still standing there.  I say nothing, no eye contact, wait until my wife is in the car, and as I'm getting in he starts coming towards us.  I pull out my phone, start trying to record and he starts bowing up saying he wants to fight ect.  She's yelling how rediculous this is, tells me to just go.  His mom grabs him, we pull off.

Wife doesn't stop yelling though because......

SHE IS YELLING AT ME!!! 

Now shes mad because she thinks I instigated it.  Same guy that called to cancel her daughters counseling appointment yesterday, same guy who immediately started blowing her phone up about me today being there, like I always am, on and on.

She knows he's dangerous and violent, and uses any excuse to not let their daughter call (1 call on his time a month, maybe) but when does reality set in for her that what he's doing is controlling and he wants to isolate her, so trying to get along with him is a no win game.  He has repeatedly tried to lure her out alone for various reasons and even shown up at times when he doesn't think I'll be there.

My father has been emotionally abusing my mother for a while now, with offs and ons, but it always resorts back to him emotionally abusing my mother. I do not wish to go into much detail, but everyone in my family (mother, myself, sister) have politely told our father how he constantly emotionally abuses my mother. At this point, it is impossible to speak to him, as no matter what you will say, no matter how polite, any constructive criticism you give him will result in him blaming you for ""attacking"" him. He will constantly start screaming at my mother when she is asking questions that a normal wife would ask her husband, like ""Hey I saw you went out for a bit, where did you go?"" in the politest, kindest manner possible. No matter what she does, says, anything, he screams at her constantly.

My family is in the lower middle class. We live in an apartment that is by far the cheapest in my area, and we cannot afford to separate. My mother works tirelessly at her job throughout the day, only to have to clean the house, clean up my father's messes, deal with his emotional abuse, care for her children. There are little opportunities for different places that we can move into. My sister is in college, and it is already hard enough to pay for that, let alone move out and go through all of the costs to do that. Since school is currently online due to COVID-19, internet is a necessity and that threatens to go away based on its cost. 

My father cannot be trusted with money. As a child, I would obtain birthday and Christmas money, and I would often save it up for years at a time, just for my father to ""borrow"" hundreds of dollars and never pay it back. He is an untrustworthy, lying, quick-to-anger, self-centered, emotionally abusing man.

Another problem is our dog. We were lucky enough to make an agreement with our landlords to even have a dog in the first place, and it will be hard to find a place that will allow dogs. We would also need to be able to afford to move our stuff.  We will also be paying for my college after next year.

This is not to say he still isn't abusive because he is, it just isn't nearly as often. It might be once a year or so.

He has beaten me, my mother, and my siblings. Mainly when we were younger but once we got older we would always step in to defend our mother and we would just kind of get hit because we were in the middle. My sister claims that he has denied that I ever even experienced any of his abuse. However, everything is so real and I was there and endured his abuse for my whole childhood. He also drinks a lot and got arrested for drunk driving last year. However, he is a functioning alcoholic and never misses a day of work because of it. He is our main provider and always has been, but in the past, he has used that to his advantage by threatening us if we ever called the police. 

I do love him. and I care for him and I want him to apologize and sincerely mean it. I am just not sure how to address this or have a conversation with him about the way his abuse has made me feel. Our family has never had this conversation. It's as if we always ignore the fact that he would become a monster at night and terrorize our home. Many nights that felt like a complete nightmare due to his actions.

My infancy was good; I was held a lot by my parents and my mom stayed home all day with me. Both of my parents have said I was a very happy and giggly baby and a joy to be around. This was all going to change, however.

When I was a year old, we got evicted from our apartment and moved in with my grandparents. My parents’ marriage crumbled and my dad had to move out. He looked at me sleeping in my crib that day, knowing he had to leave, expecting to never see me again. Through my childhood I was told my dad didn’t want to raise me anymore and it was also implied to be due to me being diagnosed with Autism.

I was diagnosed with Autism and put through ABA inspired therapies in order to function as normally as possible. My grandmother especially pushed me to make eye contact and let people hug me, no matter how I felt. I couldn’t appear to be a rude child to anyone she knew, so I let people do it. 

When I was in after school daycare, I was told by the workers that I had to share my toys with other children. It went as far as the workers allowing other children to take stuff from me/not punishing them if they did.

By the time I got to my teen years, my grandmother was still washing me in the bath when I stayed over. I had been pushing her to let me bathe on my own since I hit puberty but she refused to allow it. She thought that due to my Autism, I was incapable of bathing. She used the same rationale to justify dressing me and helping me into bathing suits long after I was capable.

I got involved with two internet predators, both of whom consumed my life. Both of them would require me to keep in constant contact, preventing me from developing a social life. 

I dated a man whose mother was especially abusive towards me. She would yell at me, threaten me, and treat me like a small child. Her son rarely ever defended me against her and often said I deserved it.

My next partner was no better. We were long distance and he was sexually aggressive very early on, demanding that I send him sexual pictures. This eventually became videos, which had to happen weekly minimum. He used sex as a punishment for any and all infractions. If I said the wrong thing, took too long coming home, or didn’t tell him about a purchase I made, he would punish me by forcing me to get naked over Skype. I would be forced to finger myself or do whatever he told. I had to inflict pain on myself for his own pleasure.

I visited him last year and his attitude towards me changed. A couple days into the visit, he got angry with me for fidgeting too much in my sleep. He spent the morning yelling at me and then apologized. He took me out for coffee to try to “repair our bond”

A few days later, I went to bed at around 2 in the morning. He was still awake so he continued to watch TV for another few minutes. He eventually came to bed and started touching me while I was trying to sleep. He felt me up under my clothes and tried to have sex with me, despite me trying to sleep. I asked him to please stop and told him I wanted to sleep. He said no and continued to touch me, also starting to remove my clothes. I started to cry and pleaded with him to stop. He got angry with me and told me to go into the bathroom. I got up and sat on the floor in his bathroom for probably 20 minutes until he grabbed me and pushed me to his bed.

Once he got me to the bed, he said he was going to give me something to cry about. He pushed me down and pulled my bottoms off. He forced himself inside me and thrusted as hard as he could. I asked him to please stop but he continued even harder. He continued for around 15 to 20 minutes as I cried, frozen. He suddenly stopped and apologized. I stayed unable to move until I coaxed myself into pulling my pants up. He said he would never do it again and I just lay there, still frozen. I did not sleep well that night.

On another occasion, we got into an argument. After yelling at me and telling me I was nothing but an arrogant brat, he placed his hands on my neck. He pressed down and choked me for a minute. Not long enough for me to lose consciousness, but long enough to let me know who was in charge. I knew then he could kill me if he wanted to.

I am pleased to say I am doing better now. My rapist and I have split up and I am now with a lovely man. He knows about all of my trauma and never uses it against me. Now, when I cry, instead of being told I’m stupid or spoiled, I get cuddles and love. My boyfriend allows and encourages me to go for walks, to have friends, etc. He’s been there through the hard times and the easy times.

I'm in a situation where from the time I was born up until I was around 16, my dad was heavily physically abusive to me, my mom, and my little brother. When I say that, I mean fits that lasted upwards of three to six hours where he would throw all of us against walls, grab our jaws so hard that it hurt to eat for several days, pull our hair, throw us on the floor and kick us, tackle us to the floor, jump on top of us and scream and spit in our face, and at times, beat our bodies with his fists. I was constantly hiding bruises at school, I remember at least one occasion where my mom hid her black eye with sunglasses from the repairman fixing our sink, and oftentimes I the abuse was so heavy I thought my dad might not realize his own strength and would accidentally kill me. I lived in constant terror.

As you can imagine, I was heavily traumatized as a kid. To make matters worse, my parents also raised me in an extremely strict religious cult, and because of the rules (particularly regarding clothing &amp; appearance), I was heavily mocked, bullied, and rejected at school and nearly every other social situation I have ever been in. When I was 12, my parents pulled me out of school because I was cutting myself (I didn't do this for attention; I did it on my thighs, which were covered at all times even in the summer due to the dress code rules, but my mom walked in on me changing), and they thought the bullying was the cause of it. Basically, they homeschooled me, except they both worked full time, so I was pretty much left alone in the house, and nearly the only social situation interaction I got until I began college was when I went to the cult church, where most of the people were mean and bullied me.

During my childhood years, my mom took 24 hours a semester and rushed to get 8 yrs of school done in 3.5 yrs, along with several certifications. What I watched her go through was brutal and intense; I watched her have so many meltdowns getting through all that school while raising my brother and I, but she was scared it might get to a point that she would have to flee for our lives, and she was terrified she wouldn't be able to support us. She went from having a few hours at a community college from years ago to being a highly educated professional and working as a controller, and making a decent amount more financially than my dad does. When that happened, she stood up to him and stopped the hours long fits and physical abuse.

Basically, I'm in a situation where the physical abuse and emotional manipulation, the years of isolation, and the bullying have created a cocktail where I'm struggling to be mentally stable, though I've mostly dealt with this by being a perfectionist. I was not educated well during the years I was isolated, however, I was already so far ahead because my parents had high standards and began teaching my brother and I upper level math in elementary, so I was able to get into community college early and didn't struggle with math until I hit pre-cal. I was always made to read a lot, too, so I tended to excel in the non-math courses. As a youth, to cope with my pain, I embraced the fantasy of being perfect, and I ended up doing things like getting up at 4 AM to work out amd teaching myself to speak a second language fluently. However, I struggle with bulimia, it's better now, but it was horrible for years, I have really bad OCD and compulsions, and while I got on Lexapro for the first time in February and it's absolutely changed my life, all the flashbacks and things I'm dealing with still make it really hard to cope.

Anyway, my parents are better now that my dad doesn't physically abuse me, but my parents are still heavily emotionally manipulative and it takes a toll on me. Tonight, they yelled at me for something I never said for five hours; I'm not exaggerating. I begged them that I just wanted to go; I'm always respectful to them. They literally ran around the room, threw things like a chair and a dip machine, my mom threw two iron weights against the floor so hard they broke, they screamed at the top of their lungs, and all of the emotional manipulation and twisted logic was just a lot. Now that I'm on anxiety meds and my boyfriend has come into my life and has actually pointed out bow twisted their logic is and validated my feelings/assured me that their insults to me are unfounded, I cope better, but it still hurts, and tonight left me so exhausted and drained. I cried to the point I was dehydrated. 

But, my problem is, back to my perfectionism, I set my sights on medical school a few years ago because I thought it would give me self worth, but I've actually come to love medicine. I'm going to be a senior after I finish my summer classes, I've gotten through most of the more difficult classes and have a high GPA, and with all the research I've done on GPA, the MCAT, ECs, etc., I genuinely believe I'll be able to get in. My parents are very financially generous, and they're paying for everything, including my education (even though I try to offer to pay for things, they won't let me). My mom is extremely controlling; she called my boss a month after I was fired for something minor where a lot of other employees agreed the boss had it out for me, but it was whatever, and chewed the boss out. That humiliated me. The idea of a parent calling their nearly 21 year old child's boss a month after that child was let go is so inappropriate and embarrassing, but both parents believe that's their right as parents because they pay the bills. My mom found out I lost my virginity last year, and she is mad I haven't apologized to her for that. I lied and said I only had sex with my boyfriend one time and am not sexually active, but she treats my boyfriend like trash now and hates him even though he's an amazing guy, and she loved him before she knew that. She was extremely angry when she found out I was in his bedroom this weekend, even though it was daytime and his parents were right outside in the living room. She questions me on everything, her control exhausts me. I spend several hours a day doing chores, I'm highly responsible, don't drink, smoke, use drugs, etc., am very respectful and don't back talk, but she will not stop seeing me as a child.

So, I have one year left until I'm done with my bachelor's. I'm scared my GPA might drop if I have to work full time while I'm taking classes like O-Chem 2, and I also need to study for the MCAT. The fact that they're paying for everything, and I don't have to pay my own way makes it easier to shadow, research, etc. I'm already on the home stretch, and I know that if by some chance I didn't get into medical school, I'd be stuck with a biology degree I can't do a lot with, and I'd have to give up my dream. I don't know what to do. It sounds silly that I legitimately fear they might beat me again some day. I keep my phone with me, so I can call 911 if that were to happen. I hate having that kind of fear in my own house. But I'm so scared of striking out on my own and not getting in and being screwed.

What would you all do in this situation? Try to hold out and keep a phone close by in case anything happens? I don't think my life is in danger, but I do think I could be decently injured (I don't predict it, but it wouldn't surprise me). They put their hands on me forcefully now, especially my mom, but they don't abuse me. Are there options where I could move out and get into medical school, too? Could I take out loans? My parents have access to my bank account and would take that, my phone, and my car. I'm going to start my own bank account for my next job and hope they don't say anything, but if I were to strike out right now, I'd essentially have nothing to my name.

Within the first few months, he had slapped me very hard a few times, the first being after I said Usher was sexy. He told me not to disrespect him like that. 
At 6 months together we moved in together, and things changed a lot. I had moved 4 hours away from my family of be with him since he moved for work. I was attending college but eventually stopped. We didn't have internet so I stayed at home pretty much all day. I would clean and do my make-up and wait for him to be home. 
When he was home, he would basically ignore me, or insist that I perform oral sex on him, which I didn't mind, but if I said I didn't want to, he would berate me, sometimes hurt me, definitely forced it a bunch of times. 
I will say that I have a kink which is being forced, but a lot of the time, I wasn't into it and asked him to stop. He didn't. And if I cried he enjoyed it even more.
If he was annoyed by my fighting sometimes he would stop and throw me to the floor, calling me useless. (This has never stopped btw, 15 years in and he still does it). 
One night he came home from being at a bar with his sister (I was 18 and couldn't go). He was in a bad mood, I could tell. I tried to be nice but because he was so drunk, he wanted to have sex. He was having... difficulties...and said it was because I was overweight. I told him he could hurt me, (I'm a masochist and he's a sadist) and that helped, but he took it too far. He raped me and beat me for 4 hours. I know because I kept focusing on the digital clock on the bedside table. Bright red numbers counting the minutes of my terror.
A month after that I left, but 4 months of being with a worse guy and basically being homeless, I begged him to come save me. He showed up, got me off the drugs I was addicted to, and held me through my withdrawals. I suffered a miscarriage also, I didn't even know I was pregnant. He was so caring and sweet, and had done a lot of maturing while we were broken up.
We get an apartment together and it's like a fairytale. We don't fight, don't argue, we were madly in love again. We lived there for a year and it was great. Then he lost his career, we moved to a different apartment, and he started drinking heavily. We had a friend living with us and he drank with him all day and night..I'm talking they finished off entire handles each, and he started being controlling again. I had to keep the house clean and cook every meal for him and our roommate. He would punch my leg and keep digging his thumb into the bruise if I didn't do what I was supposed to do. He hated when I hung out with friends, and constantly accused me of cheating. At the time, Myspace was still a thing and he had numerous girls on there who he would go spend time with...I have since found out he was cheating.
After I finally kicked out roommate out for bringing over people who would steal from us, he sobered up and his behavior stopped being so bad. He would romance me and things got better. 
We got another place since we were kicked out of that place (long story) and though he was still very controlling thing calmed down again. 
Now I want to say that I love this man with everything I have. He doesn't react with rage, he doesn't beat me into a corner, he doesn't do what I consider to be abuse. Not since that first year together. But, in the 15 years we've been together, he goes through stages of being aggressive towards me. He insults me, forces sex or sexual acts, and then it stops. For months at a time sometimes. It's gotten to the point where I don't know how to feel normal. It's almost like I want him to be like that because it feels like our normal...? Does that make sense?? Not to mention that it has severely affected my sexual pleasure, I can't seem to enjoy myself if he isn't being aggressive or at least demeaning me in some way. It's something he's always done, and I don't know how to ""get off"" without it.
Flash forward to 2011, we moved again, again away from my family and friends, and again I try to go to school, and he gets a good job. But as before, I stop going to school and stay home all day. I clean, I cook, etc. We would rarely go out to town or anything, we were always home. He started to be a little more aggressive more often. Randomly. I didn't know what would set it off. One time I had a black eye, a very mild one, but it was there. He took me out to eat and go shopping, after making me do my makeup so it wasn't visible. While out he asked me how it felt to know people had no idea that he hurt me like that since we look so happy. I didn't know what to say but he put my hand on his crotch and he was as hard as a rock. 
Later he held me down and forced himself on me while slapping me harder than before on the same side where the bruise was. 
We lived out there for almost 10 years. This behavior became more frequent and more intense. My entire life became centered around him and what he liked or didn't like. My appearance, my housekeeping, everything. But again it wasn't like what I believed abuse to be. I've seen in movies or heard about it from people and it just seemed more dramatic and violent than what he would do. What he did was always cool and calm, he did it with such ease and confidence, I kept telling myself it was a game, he did it to turn himself on, because he's a sadist. We played around with bondage, role played, all the normal BDSM stuff so I just thought it was part of it. 
He'd do it for a while, constantly, then as before, he would just stop. And again I felt myself needing it. I'd need him to hit me, or be mean to me. I found myself feeling anxious or uneasy if he wasn't being dominant and mean. So I would ask. And if I brought up that I felt he went too far and said maybe this was abuse and not good, he would laugh and say I asked for it....which I did. 
So it was something I wanted...
Here I am, almost 16 years together with him and now it's scary. Again his drinking got bad and he has been doing it more. But it's different now. Now I tell him I don't want it. I cry. I fight. I break down and he just keeps doing it. He says he doesn't care that I don't want it. I tell him I'm afraid of him and he smiles and says good. He'll get drunk and throw me to the ground if I say something he considered too sassy or bitchy. He doesn't always hit me, but he holds me down and says awful things to me. He makes me cry. He reminds me I have nowhere to go. That if I leave I would just go running back to him because I can't do anything right, (I have some issues so he's not wrong) and that no other man would ever be able to deal with my baggage and no one would want an overweight woman in her 30s. The sad thing is he's right. He uses me past against me when he wants to make me cry. 
And every time he does this he gets hard. He can't help but touch himself as he's either hurting me or demeaning me and insulting me. He loves doing it. 
I love him. I know I do because we've been through so much and we really are like best friends. We understand each other so well, we have been so close since the day we met. And I have my own problems. I take responsibility for him getting a taste for hurting me, because I was curious about BDSM and that stuff when we were first dating, but I never imagined he was actually abusive. Or is this abuse? I don't have bruises all over my body, I don't cower in a corner, although I have before, he doesn't beat me senseless... it just doesn't feel like the abuse we all know about from ads and movies, etc. 
I don't fear for my life because he doesn't lash out like that, he hasn't escalated like I assume he should have by now,... IDK what to call this. 


Honestly I'm not sure why I'm sharing this because I have no intention of leaving him, he's my world. I am happy with him. My day to day life is good, we laugh all the time.

We use to live with friends in a house then spent time at his moms. My bf and I have been together for 2 years. He has gotten physically violent by moving me or shoving me out of the way before we were in the one bedroom but never anything that crazy ridiculous. I take his stuff like his mouse or his charger and hide it when he would ignore me or stonewall me after a fight. He says I took him for granted so that's why he had to get away from me or zone out. We got a one bedroom so he could have his own space because he doesnt trust me to respect his space. It's TRUE I guess. When I wanna talk with him or discuss a fight, he just stonewalls for like a day or a week or a month. It's gotten better now he just disappears to his moms for a whole 24 hours... at one point he took my phone during a fight so I took his stuff and told him give it back or I'm gonna throw it and I did and I felt awful I havent hurt any of his thing since because I really never wanted to hurt anything of his but he had pushed me around and shoved me to the ground and said horrible things to me then took my phone and it was bad. About a 2 month ago hes got into it with his brother and his brothers friend at a a party at his moms and after he pinned his brother to the wall his brother followed him and they went back to our place so his sister gave me a ride. He texted me sorry. During the fight he got mean towards me because I was telling him to calm down. All he did was text me sorry. And when I got back the next evening I tried to talk about it with him and he was like ""why do I owe you anything"" and we got into a fight and again I wouldnt give him his space and I poked the bear as I always do and he throw me down and he covered my mouth and my nose so I couldnt breath... he also laid down on my head so my head was stuck between him and the floor btw my bf is a big guy like 250lb 6 feet tall huge linebacker. I am 5 feet tall 124lb Now here i am a few months later. I hid his keys so he couldn't leave I followed him every time he did try to leave and after all that when I wouldn't give him space in his room he shoved me he held me down hes hit me ""not that hard"" he said. Hes dragged me around by my hair or my feet he held me down and grabbed my breasts just to be disrespectful and he broke all of my art on my walls because I moved stuff around in his room to get his attention. Hes pressed my head into the ground and called me awful names and held my jaw closed so I couldnt scream. Covered my face multiple times. He kept hold me down and I always struggled and it hurt my arm and my back he stretched my leg and covered my mouth so I could cry while he pushed it upwards he grabbed me by my neck and pinned in weird backwards position .My shoulders hurt my body hurts my face hurts, not bad but it hurts. Hes left barely any Mark's but there are Mark's on my face and my neck. He kept hurting my eye while trying to cover my mouth. I called the police they showed I covered for him because none of this wouldve happened if I didnt poke the bear. I pushed his button I did whatever I knew I could to push his buttons.

He put out a lit cigarette on me about a year ago and has shaken me by the shoulders, but nothing more than that.  I can see now, though, how thoroughly he manipulates and emotionally abuses me.

I cheated early in our relationship, but have been faithful for five years.  Still, every issue we have is ""my fault"" because I destroyed him with this.

He has called me names, said really terrible things about me, and isolated me as thoroughly as he could.  He tells me that when I talk to other people about the things he says and does that I am being ""emotionally abusive"" and manipulative, because I want everyone on my side.  He says he's in charge of our marriage.  When he gets angry, it's always ""my fault"" for ""provoking"" him because ""I love drama"".  When I go away, usually for a day, ""we can't work things out if I'm ignoring him"".  He loves me so much.  He's so sorry.  He's in a really dark place.  He's just off drugs.  ""I don't love him"".  ""There's another man in my life"".  ""I am giving up"".  ""I don't really want this to work"".  

It usually works really well for him.  I'm usually back within a day or two.  The cycle starts over.  Promises made, honeymoon phase, promises broken, argument, feeling guilty, realizing it's not all my fault, leaving, feeling more guilty, and repeat.

And I still married him. Because I loved him. And because he was moving with the military to Europe. And because all attempts at leaving before were unsuccessful. 

So I moved with him. And all my hurt would come out in waves when I couldn't hold it in anymore. That's when he first hurt me by grabbing my arm, holding a hand over my face so I couldn't yell, leaving bruises in innocuous places. Flicking my nose.

""I'm so sorry. I love you so much. You just need to deal with your issues. I wouldn't have done it if you hadn't been freaking out.""

Then he took the first step to hurting me intentionally. He slapped my arm while we were cooking.

""Well you wouldn't shut up.""

Then the escalation. Putting my face between his arm and his hand because I was ""raising my voice."" Fighting him off led to me sitting on the floor where he knelt down, placed a hand around my throat and pushed. And then mocked me when I fought to get my breath back. 

""I love you. Don't leave. We can work through this. You want to stay married right? You promise?""

How could I say no. I was alone, in a foreign country, no family, no real connections yet. We hadn't even been married a year. 

""I'm tired of this petty bullshit. You stupid bitch. Fucking idiot. You're psychotic.""

He loved the mental health angle. He loved using specific words to incite my past struggles. Throwing my fight with self-harm in my face. Never praising that I had come so far and gotten so much better.

Then he finally hit me. And when I wouldn't stop bleeding, that's when he wanted to sit and talk. That's when I needed to calm down.

And I feel guilty. About *everything*. 

I called for help. Got taken away. Taken to the ER. Mandated into unrestricted reporting. Set up with interviews and Victims Advocates. Pictures were taken of my body, my face. Black eye, scratches, bruises. 

And I feel like it's not a big deal. I should just go home and apologize. I'm still in a foreign country. I have no family. I have one person willing to take me in temporarily. 

I have a job I love. I have a dog I adore. 

And I still feel guilty. I feel ashamed. I want to call him. Apologize. Over and over. Just go back. Let things blow over, move on. The world is already a dumpster fire, why should I make it harder on us. Why should I put his career and reputation in jeopardy.

He drank every night. And I just did it too. Seemed easier. It led to worse fights. But sometimes it just led to peaceful passing out. 

He is broken. Hurting. Full of pain, anger, and anguish. He has trauma he's never dealt with. I wanted to comfort him. I want to comfort him.

I always had a hard time hiding my temper when I felt like my ex was stupid when I helped her with her studies. She hated herself during such times, and hated me for making her hate herself. Bad feelings became verbal arguments, and then escalated to her hitting me to let the anger out.

When I initiated the breakup, her very rare violent behaviors soon escalated into full blow. She slapped, bit, threw things at me, pushed me up against the wall, threatened to harm me and my family, and once pointed a knife at me.

I know that she probably has deep-seated problems, but I feel guilty because I feel like my constant put-downs and dissatisfactions in her and in the relationship somehow contributed to her bad mental state and behavior, or at least that's what she told me. She was very sweet and gentle in the beginning, but somehow it turned into this.

So I guess what I wanted to ask was, is the relationship irreversible and can only get worse if somehow we maintain our connection? And am I right in feeling guilty in this, or is her problem only something bigger and I had a very small part to play?

I told him i was pregnant. He came to the appointment and had two shots of whiskey after. Handled it well at first. Second Prenatal appointment was awkward, refused prenatal vitamins, no smiles from either of us. He always wrestled me roughly because i was getting rid of it anyway it didnt matter. Asked me why i watched what i ate because it didnt matter. Yelled at me in the regular, avoided me.


I tried to eat a lot of parsley. It didnt work. Aspirin, didnt work. ""You cant clean a house, we arent ready for a baby what would it eat, fucking roaches?"" I cleaned the house hoping maybe i would be ready. Still, no. ""We dont have enough furniture. We need our own place, you're bad at cleaning, we need more time together alone, we need to travel""

Two years later i am still with him and we have bought a house, have furniture, I have a career, we have a car, i clean more now. Seeing a roach gives me that same flashback about why i wasn't good enough to keep my baby.

I covered all the mirrors in the house because i couldn't stand to look at myself, started drinking, defeated alcoholism later on and he hasnt changed a bit.

This post isn't about me; its about my sister. 

About a year ago, my eighteen year old sister brought a guy back to my house (my moms...but still, I live here) and he was alright at first. For the first month or so, he was actually a decent person. However, after that first month, everything flipped upside down. The verbal abuse began little by little. Not knowing the true scope of this abuse - I felt bad for him. He talked about how bad of a life he had, and that he suffers from mental illness. As time went on, he would blame everything on mental illness. We found out my sister was pregnant, and it only made everything so much worse. I decided to hire him at a store I was managing, just for him to mix alcohol and Xanax while on the job, causing him to black out and literally destroy my car while running around almost naked.

I am absolutely terrified that he will put his hands on my sister already. Every night, I hear her screaming and crying, while he is yelling at her while making violent threats towards my family. When we defend my sister, she denies that anything is wrong, while he continues to threaten us in a house that he lives in for free. She refuses to let us kick him out, because that's the father of her child and he apparently took her virginity, she ""loves"" him. I dont want to repeat anything that has been said because it is very triggering. My parents have no idea what is truly going on because they're deaf and can't hear the entiee context of the arguments/abuse. I absolutely cannot handle this anymore. He is SO disrespectful towards my mom - he has even said that he cheated on her because she was signing and driving at the same time?? (She was asking directions so he could sell percocets...) We have screenshots of him threatening us. Now that the baby has been born and hes a few months old, the mental abuse continues. He threatens to take the baby across the country to his family's house on a daily basis, yet leaves my mom, the same person he talks trash about every single day, to take care of the baby while my sister suffers from post partum depression. If he ever leaves, we want to move into a place that he will never find.

What do i do? How do I get him out of the house? We are all terrified of him.

Without going into too much detail I'm a citizen of a country that opresses women and living in a country that opresses women. My father makes being a woman even harder with his strict religious rules and beliefs. I have been raised to be submissive while my whole being shouts for me to escape but I don't see how.

If i ever said where i lived no one would touch me with a 10 foot pole because there is nothing that can be done that will make my situation better in this country. Only a miracle would change my situation.

There is no support for abused or opressed woman in this country

I don't know how to escape or where to escape.

While I have no physical marks or bruises my inside is filled with the scars of emotional and physiological abuse. I need help but no where to turn to, no one to go to, no one to support me, no one who would listen.

Will I stay opressed my whole life? What's the point of living a life like that? I don't see any light at the end of the tunnel.

Well, we are still texting a few times daily, so I am not technically out of the relationship yet, and perhaps won't for some time. However I am gradually starting to see the abusive patterns in our relationship, and view things as they really were.

I wasn't really wrong when I felt frustrated she couldn't understand it when I explained programming concepts to help her study. I always tried my best to constrain the frustration when teaching her, but she would always pick it out and lash out at me in return. I realize that I wasn't wrong when I repeatedly told her I was having doubts about the relationship, it was an attempt of open communication and it wasn't a sin, or that I was putting her down and deliberately making her feel inadequate. I wasn't really wrong when I wanted out, despite the fact that she followed me to a new country when I gave her a sort of ultimatum (""If you don't come to Canada, we'll have to break up."").

She is trying to layer all these guilt upon me, and even now, I still feel guilty and responsible for the above things I did.

I went back to the island one week ago, because I missed her like hell. I missed her so much that my heart felt weak and my hands trembled. It is funny, how I had been pondering breakup for the majority of the day, but ever since I really went out, I could miss her so much. My emotional dependence on her was undeniable. Every day she waited for me in front of the fireplace. She used to be so happy when I returned, and she would care about my life and health, cook for me, and listen to all the silly and the most out-of-the-world things I had to say. I missed having someone always there for me.

But the bad times, oh they were so bad. Her opinion of me shifts drastically during those episodes where she felt she wasn't ""understood."" She gaslights me (""No I haven't said that"", ""no I didn't do it"", blatantly tells me that my feelings are unimportant to her, tells me I am too needy, that all my future partners will cheat on me because of that, says that me and all my family are psychopaths, and that I won't have any achievements in life, that my pouring out my heart to her made her feel speechless, etc. That I am selfish, fake and have a weak soul.

The days pending the breakup which I initiated were the worst. She blamed me for all her problems, and accused me of not caring about her at all. She slapped, choked, kicked, bit, threw things at me, pushed me up against walls, and once pointed a knife at me. She would stand in front of my room at night with ""that look,"" refused to let me sleep and gave me verbal threats for half an hour, sitting at my bed and staring at the wall. In the daytime she kept talking to herself. I was so scared.

She is normal at most times and in front of others, especially now which is weeks after I left. I know she misses me as well, but not to such an extent as I missed her. She easily closes off her emotions, as she herself said, and according to articles of personality disorders. She would think of me randomly during the day, but I guess that's basically it.

I realize that it's going to be an uphill battle, perhaps filled with loneliness, but also filled with freedom. I know that going back to the island where I used to, and somewhat still, feel like it's a home, isn't the answer to all this. Last time I went, I relived the sweetest times, but then triggered one of her episodes and got slapped, blamed and threatened in return. I won't contemplate going back to her again. She is not likely to change in the following months and even years to come.

This is what I have been thinking about today, and I am posting this out to share with you all.",domesticviolence,Finally seeing the abuse as they really were.,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/gw165j/finally_seeing_the_abuse_as_they_really_were/,True

My wife was on the downhill of an abusive marriage when we met.  Initially we were just friends, but I made her feel better, so she could take more of his abuse but also stand up for herself more.  He had stopped being physically violent by that point, he's 6'3 265+, so for him it was more verbal and punching walls or threats since he had established he could best her up anytime he just had to remind her.

She hid most of it, but I became a huge issue for them and I got used to him calling to threaten me ect once she grew numb.

Fast forward a few years, she left, eventually we got married, good times.  But they had joint custody and he started back up, screaming at her (after convincing  her she couldn't record), threatening and intimidating ect.  It escalated into stalking while I was deployed and that's when she finally told me the whole history and it clicked just how violent he could get.  Cops wouldn't take it seriously (NC isn't too progressive), and I started learning how little the system knows about its own laws.  I got smarter, but it takes FOREVER to build a case on someone who now knows they are being watched, dozens of reports, cops know him it's just waiting for a big blowup now.  The assumption is I'm here to protect her now, problem is they also tell me how fast I'll get arrested for doing it.

Brings us to today.  We show up to drop her daughter off, in the police station parking lot like always.  Ex gets out with his mom.  Daughter walks over to grandma, they go to get in his van.  He's still standing there.  I say nothing, no eye contact, wait until my wife is in the car, and as I'm getting in he starts coming towards us.  I pull out my phone, start trying to record and he starts bowing up saying he wants to fight ect.  She's yelling how rediculous this is, tells me to just go.  His mom grabs him, we pull off.

Wife doesn't stop yelling though because......

SHE IS YELLING AT ME!!! 

Now shes mad because she thinks I instigated it.  Same guy that called to cancel her daughters counseling appointment yesterday, same guy who immediately started blowing her phone up about me today being there, like I always am, on and on.

She knows he's dangerous and violent, and uses any excuse to not let their daughter call (1 call on his time a month, maybe) but when does reality set in for her that what he's doing is controlling and he wants to isolate her, so trying to get along with him is a no win game.  He has repeatedly tried to lure her out alone for various reasons and even shown up at times when he doesn't think I'll be there.

My father has been emotionally abusing my mother for a while now, with offs and ons, but it always resorts back to him emotionally abusing my mother. I do not wish to go into much detail, but everyone in my family (mother, myself, sister) have politely told our father how he constantly emotionally abuses my mother. At this point, it is impossible to speak to him, as no matter what you will say, no matter how polite, any constructive criticism you give him will result in him blaming you for ""attacking"" him. He will constantly start screaming at my mother when she is asking questions that a normal wife would ask her husband, like ""Hey I saw you went out for a bit, where did you go?"" in the politest, kindest manner possible. No matter what she does, says, anything, he screams at her constantly.

My family is in the lower middle class. We live in an apartment that is by far the cheapest in my area, and we cannot afford to separate. My mother works tirelessly at her job throughout the day, only to have to clean the house, clean up my father's messes, deal with his emotional abuse, care for her children. There are little opportunities for different places that we can move into. My sister is in college, and it is already hard enough to pay for that, let alone move out and go through all of the costs to do that. Since school is currently online due to COVID-19, internet is a necessity and that threatens to go away based on its cost. 

My father cannot be trusted with money. As a child, I would obtain birthday and Christmas money, and I would often save it up for years at a time, just for my father to ""borrow"" hundreds of dollars and never pay it back. He is an untrustworthy, lying, quick-to-anger, self-centered, emotionally abusing man.

Another problem is our dog. We were lucky enough to make an agreement with our landlords to even have a dog in the first place, and it will be hard to find a place that will allow dogs. We would also need to be able to afford to move our stuff.  We will also be paying for my college after next year.

This is not to say he still isn't abusive because he is, it just isn't nearly as often. It might be once a year or so.

He has beaten me, my mother, and my siblings. Mainly when we were younger but once we got older we would always step in to defend our mother and we would just kind of get hit because we were in the middle. My sister claims that he has denied that I ever even experienced any of his abuse. However, everything is so real and I was there and endured his abuse for my whole childhood. He also drinks a lot and got arrested for drunk driving last year. However, he is a functioning alcoholic and never misses a day of work because of it. He is our main provider and always has been, but in the past, he has used that to his advantage by threatening us if we ever called the police. 

I do love him. and I care for him and I want him to apologize and sincerely mean it. I am just not sure how to address this or have a conversation with him about the way his abuse has made me feel. Our family has never had this conversation. It's as if we always ignore the fact that he would become a monster at night and terrorize our home.

It's been years of torment as we lived together and he has said he couldn't afford to move out (has had issues holding down a steady job throughout the years). I've kicked him out 2x before  but he ended up coming back. He never hit me but has been verbally and emotionally abusive over the years-telling me things like 'don't get me angry or I'll blow up' over the smallest things, and calling me every name in the book. He's destroyed many of my household items or he's threatened to if I don't do something he's asked right that minute. I already have issues with anxiety and he just raises it through the roof at times. I jump at loud noises because I now equate it with him blowing up and getting ready to damage something of mine. For a while I had issues with I think it's called dissociative disorder. I would look in the mirror or look at my hands and not feel like they were mine. He's even told me I should commit suicide and told me a way to do it (I am not suicidal and would never do that).

 I finally went on a domestic abuse website for help and spent 2hrs on a chat. The person sent me resources I could look over and and they helped me devise a plan to start the motions of getting him out of my apartment. Unfortunately, not even 1/2 hr later I had to text 911 for help as he threatened me, pulled a knife from the kitchen and started stabbing the couch, and then told me to keep quiet. 

He's been arrested and held. I feel relief, sadness, shock, and guilt. He definitely has some mental issues that he refused to get help with (refused to see any doctors, wouldn't go for annual check up, wouldn't even sign up for health insurance) I'm afraid of the whole process going forward and what will come next (which is why it took me so long to call, and why his sister likely never called). I'm sad that it had to come to this and wish we could've just peacefully separated. He's said off and on throughout our relationship that he wanted to leave, and then would eventually just terrorize me.

 I feel guilt because he doesn't have the means to rent and I'm not sure where he will end up. I know this is his fault and that it's not something I should worry about, but it's something the weighs on me now.

I also feel relief because I finally told my parents what's been going on.

I have since moved on and got with an amazing man who has not even a shred of abusive tendencies in him. I love him more than I thought was possible - it's made me realise I don't think I ever loved my ex, only co-dependency feelings.   
I had not liked or really even tolerated my ex partner for a very long time, but I'd given up hope and so stayed, as we have a kid together.   
Eventually I saw behaviours in our child that I did not like (clearly mirroring his dad), and so I found the strength to get rid for good. I still have to have some contact with my ex, for obvious reasons. He has much more control over my life at this point, than I expected. I have so much regret that I even met him.  


Anyway, my issue is anger. I feel so angry with him all the time. Absolutely furious. Every day, all day, I have his voice in my head insulting me, criticising me and picking arguments. I then end up arguing back or defending myself. When I say voice I don't mean as in psychosis that I think it is real - it's just my thoughts, like day dreaming. This person has caused me so so so much damage, both emotionally and practically. I don't want him to continue causing me this much pain and anger on a daily basis, but my brain seems stuck in 4F mode.

I have some grounding exercises to do, but it is often when I am doing housework or cooking, and so it's difficult to do the grounding stuff at that time. I end up in tears all the time.

Within the first few months, he had slapped me very hard a few times, the first being after I said Usher was sexy. He told me not to disrespect him like that. 
At 6 months together we moved in together, and things changed a lot. I had moved 4 hours away from my family of be with him since he moved for work. I was attending college but eventually stopped. We didn't have internet so I stayed at home pretty much all day. I would clean and do my make-up and wait for him to be home. 
When he was home, he would basically ignore me, or insist that I perform oral sex on him, which I didn't mind, but if I said I didn't want to, he would berate me, sometimes hurt me, definitely forced it a bunch of times. 
I will say that I have a kink which is being forced, but a lot of the time, I wasn't into it and asked him to stop. He didn't. And if I cried he enjoyed it even more.
If he was annoyed by my fighting sometimes he would stop and throw me to the floor, calling me useless. (This has never stopped btw, 15 years in and he still does it). 
One night he came home from being at a bar with his sister (I was 18 and couldn't go). He was in a bad mood, I could tell. I tried to be nice but because he was so drunk, he wanted to have sex. He was having... difficulties...and said it was because I was overweight. I told him he could hurt me, (I'm a masochist and he's a sadist) and that helped, but he took it too far. He raped me and beat me for 4 hours. I know because I kept focusing on the digital clock on the bedside table. Bright red numbers counting the minutes of my terror.
A month after that I left, but 4 months of being with a worse guy and basically being homeless, I begged him to come save me. He showed up, got me off the drugs I was addicted to, and held me through my withdrawals. I suffered a miscarriage also, I didn't even know I was pregnant. He was so caring and sweet, and had done a lot of maturing while we were broken up.
We get an apartment together and it's like a fairytale. We don't fight, don't argue, we were madly in love again. We lived there for a year and it was great. Then he lost his career, we moved to a different apartment, and he started drinking heavily. We had a friend living with us and he drank with him all day and night..I'm talking they finished off entire handles each, and he started being controlling again. I had to keep the house clean and cook every meal for him and our roommate. He would punch my leg and keep digging his thumb into the bruise if I didn't do what I was supposed to do. He hated when I hung out with friends, and constantly accused me of cheating. At the time, Myspace was still a thing and he had numerous girls on there who he would go spend time with...I have since found out he was cheating.
After I finally kicked out roommate out for bringing over people who would steal from us, he sobered up and his behavior stopped being so bad. He would romance me and things got better. 
We got another place since we were kicked out of that place (long story) and though he was still very controlling thing calmed down again. 
Now I want to say that I love this man with everything I have. He doesn't react with rage, he doesn't beat me into a corner, he doesn't do what I consider to be abuse. Not since that first year together. But, in the 15 years we've been together, he goes through stages of being aggressive towards me. He insults me, forces sex or sexual acts, and then it stops. For months at a time sometimes. It's gotten to the point where I don't know how to feel normal. It's almost like I want him to be like that because it feels like our normal...? Does that make sense?? Not to mention that it has severely affected my sexual pleasure, I can't seem to enjoy myself if he isn't being aggressive or at least demeaning me in some way. It's something he's always done, and I don't know how to ""get off"" without it.
Flash forward to 2011, we moved again, again away from my family and friends, and again I try to go to school, and he gets a good job. But as before, I stop going to school and stay home all day. I clean, I cook, etc. We would rarely go out to town or anything, we were always home. He started to be a little more aggressive more often. Randomly. I didn't know what would set it off. One time I had a black eye, a very mild one, but it was there. He took me out to eat and go shopping, after making me do my makeup so it wasn't visible. While out he asked me how it felt to know people had no idea that he hurt me like that since we look so happy. I didn't know what to say but he put my hand on his crotch and he was as hard as a rock. 
Later he held me down and forced himself on me while slapping me harder than before on the same side where the bruise was. 
We lived out there for almost 10 years. This behavior became more frequent and more intense. My entire life became centered around him and what he liked or didn't like. My appearance, my housekeeping, everything. But again it wasn't like what I believed abuse to be. I've seen in movies or heard about it from people and it just seemed more dramatic and violent than what he would do. What he did was always cool and calm, he did it with such ease and confidence, I kept telling myself it was a game, he did it to turn himself on, because he's a sadist. We played around with bondage, role played, all the normal BDSM stuff so I just thought it was part of it. 
He'd do it for a while, constantly, then as before, he would just stop. And again I felt myself needing it. I'd need him to hit me, or be mean to me. I found myself feeling anxious or uneasy if he wasn't being dominant and mean. So I would ask. And if I brought up that I felt he went too far and said maybe this was abuse and not good, he would laugh and say I asked for it....which I did. 
So it was something I wanted...
Here I am, almost 16 years together with him and now it's scary. Again his drinking got bad and he has been doing it more. But it's different now. Now I tell him I don't want it. I cry. I fight. I break down and he just keeps doing it. He says he doesn't care that I don't want it. I tell him I'm afraid of him and he smiles and says good. He'll get drunk and throw me to the ground if I say something he considered too sassy or bitchy. He doesn't always hit me, but he holds me down and says awful things to me. He makes me cry. He reminds me I have nowhere to go. That if I leave I would just go running back to him because I can't do anything right, (I have some issues so he's not wrong) and that no other man would ever be able to deal with my baggage and no one would want an overweight woman in her 30s. The sad thing is he's right. He uses me past against me when he wants to make me cry. 
And every time he does this he gets hard. He can't help but touch himself as he's either hurting me or demeaning me and insulting me. He loves doing it. 
I love him. I know I do because we've been through so much and we really are like best friends. We understand each other so well, we have been so close since the day we met. And I have my own problems. I take responsibility for him getting a taste for hurting me, because I was curious about BDSM and that stuff when we were first dating, but I never imagined he was actually abusive. Or is this abuse? I don't have bruises all over my body, I don't cower in a corner, although I have before, he doesn't beat me senseless... it just doesn't feel like the abuse we all know about from ads and movies, etc. 
I don't fear for my life because he doesn't lash out like that, he hasn't escalated like I assume he should have by now,... IDK what to call this. 


Honestly I'm not sure why I'm sharing this because I have no intention of leaving him, he's my world. I am happy with him. My day to day life is good, we laugh all the time. If you saw us together you'd never know that sometimes he gets rough with me or says mean things. He is normal 80% of the time.

We use to live with friends in a house then spent time at his moms. My bf and I have been together for 2 years. He has gotten physically violent by moving me or shoving me out of the way before we were in the one bedroom but never anything that crazy ridiculous. I take his stuff like his mouse or his charger and hide it when he would ignore me or stonewall me after a fight. He says I took him for granted so that's why he had to get away from me or zone out. We got a one bedroom so he could have his own space because he doesnt trust me to respect his space. It's TRUE I guess. When I wanna talk with him or discuss a fight, he just stonewalls for like a day or a week or a month. It's gotten better now he just disappears to his moms for a whole 24 hours... at one point he took my phone during a fight so I took his stuff and told him give it back or I'm gonna throw it and I did and I felt awful I havent hurt any of his thing since because I really never wanted to hurt anything of his but he had pushed me around and shoved me to the ground and said horrible things to me then took my phone and it was bad. About a 2 month ago hes got into it with his brother and his brothers friend at a a party at his moms and after he pinned his brother to the wall his brother followed him and they went back to our place so his sister gave me a ride. He texted me sorry. During the fight he got mean towards me because I was telling him to calm down. All he did was text me sorry. And when I got back the next evening I tried to talk about it with him and he was like ""why do I owe you anything"" and we got into a fight and again I wouldnt give him his space and I poked the bear as I always do and he throw me down and he covered my mouth and my nose so I couldnt breath... he also laid down on my head so my head was stuck between him and the floor btw my bf is a big guy like 250lb 6 feet tall huge linebacker. I am 5 feet tall 124lb Now here i am a few months later. I hid his keys so he couldn't leave I followed him every time he did try to leave and after all that when I wouldn't give him space in his room he shoved me he held me down hes hit me ""not that hard"" he said. Hes dragged me around by my hair or my feet he held me down and grabbed my breasts just to be disrespectful and he broke all of my art on my walls because I moved stuff around in his room to get his attention. Hes pressed my head into the ground and called me awful names and held my jaw closed so I couldnt scream. Covered my face multiple times. He kept hold me down and I always struggled and it hurt my arm and my back he stretched my leg and covered my mouth so I could cry while he pushed it upwards he grabbed me by my neck and pinned in weird backwards position .My shoulders hurt my body hurts my face hurts, not bad but it hurts. Hes left barely any Mark's but there are Mark's on my face and my neck. He kept hurting my eye while trying to cover my mouth. I called the police they showed I covered for him because none of this wouldve happened if I didnt poke the bear. I pushed his button I did whatever I knew I could to push his buttons.

He put out a lit cigarette on me about a year ago and has shaken me by the shoulders, but nothing more than that.  I can see now, though, how thoroughly he manipulates and emotionally abuses me.

I cheated early in our relationship, but have been faithful for five years.  Still, every issue we have is ""my fault"" because I destroyed him with this.

He has called me names, said really terrible things about me, and isolated me as thoroughly as he could.  He tells me that when I talk to other people about the things he says and does that I am being ""emotionally abusive"" and manipulative, because I want everyone on my side.  He says he's in charge of our marriage.  When he gets angry, it's always ""my fault"" for ""provoking"" him because ""I love drama"".  When I go away, usually for a day, ""we can't work things out if I'm ignoring him"".  He loves me so much.  He's so sorry.  He's in a really dark place.  He's just off drugs.  ""I don't love him"".  ""There's another man in my life"".  ""I am giving up"".  ""I don't really want this to work"".  

It usually works really well for him.  I'm usually back within a day or two.  The cycle starts over.  Promises made, honeymoon phase, promises broken, argument, feeling guilty, realizing it's not all my fault, leaving, feeling more guilty, and repeat.

And I still married him. Because I loved him. And because he was moving with the military to Europe. And because all attempts at leaving before were unsuccessful. 

So I moved with him. And all my hurt would come out in waves when I couldn't hold it in anymore. That's when he first hurt me by grabbing my arm, holding a hand over my face so I couldn't yell, leaving bruises in innocuous places. Flicking my nose.

""I'm so sorry. I love you so much. You just need to deal with your issues. I wouldn't have done it if you hadn't been freaking out.""

Then he took the first step to hurting me intentionally. He slapped my arm while we were cooking.

""Well you wouldn't shut up.""

Then the escalation. Putting my face between his arm and his hand because I was ""raising my voice."" Fighting him off led to me sitting on the floor where he knelt down, placed a hand around my throat and pushed. And then mocked me when I fought to get my breath back. 

""I love you. Don't leave. We can work through this. You want to stay married right? You promise?""

How could I say no. I was alone, in a foreign country, no family, no real connections yet. We hadn't even been married a year. 

""I'm tired of this petty bullshit. You stupid bitch. Fucking idiot. You're psychotic.""

He loved the mental health angle. He loved using specific words to incite my past struggles. Throwing my fight with self-harm in my face. Never praising that I had come so far and gotten so much better.

Then he finally hit me. And when I wouldn't stop bleeding, that's when he wanted to sit and talk. That's when I needed to calm down.

And I feel guilty. About *everything*. 

I called for help. Got taken away. Taken to the ER. Mandated into unrestricted reporting. Set up with interviews and Victims Advocates. Pictures were taken of my body, my face. Black eye, scratches, bruises. 

And I feel like it's not a big deal. I should just go home and apologize. I'm still in a foreign country. I have no family. I have one person willing to take me in temporarily. 

I have a job I love. I have a dog I adore. 

And I still feel guilty. I feel ashamed. I want to call him. Apologize. Over and over. Just go back. Let things blow over, move on. The world is already a dumpster fire, why should I make it harder on us. Why should I put his career and reputation in jeopardy.

He drank every night. And I just did it too. Seemed easier. It led to worse fights. But sometimes it just led to peaceful passing out. 

He is broken. Hurting. Full of pain, anger, and anguish. He has trauma he's never dealt with. I wanted to comfort him. I want to comfort him.

I always had a hard time hiding my temper when I felt like my ex was stupid when I helped her with her studies. She hated herself during such times, and hated me for making her hate herself. Bad feelings became verbal arguments, and then escalated to her hitting me to let the anger out.

When I initiated the breakup, her very rare violent behaviors soon escalated into full blow. She slapped, bit, threw things at me, pushed me up against the wall, threatened to harm me and my family, and once pointed a knife at me.

I know that she probably has deep-seated problems, but I feel guilty because I feel like my constant put-downs and dissatisfactions in her and in the relationship somehow contributed to her bad mental state and behavior, or at least that's what she told me. She was very sweet and gentle in the beginning, but somehow it turned into this.

So I guess what I wanted to ask was, is the relationship irreversible and can only get worse if somehow we maintain our connection? And am I right in feeling guilty in this, or is her problem only something bigger and I had a very small part to play?

I told him i was pregnant. He came to the appointment and had two shots of whiskey after. Handled it well at first. Second Prenatal appointment was awkward, refused prenatal vitamins, no smiles from either of us. He always wrestled me roughly because i was getting rid of it anyway it didnt matter. Asked me why i watched what i ate because it didnt matter. Yelled at me in the regular, avoided me.

I cleaned the house hoping maybe i would be ready. Still, no. ""We dont have enough furniture. We need our own place, you're bad at cleaning, we need more time together alone, we need to travel""

I covered all the mirrors in the house because i couldn't stand to look at myself, started drinking, defeated alcoholism later on and he hasnt changed a bit.

This post isn't about me; its about my sister. 

About a year ago, my eighteen year old sister brought a guy back to my house (my moms...but still, I live here) and he was alright at first. For the first month or so, he was actually a decent person. However, after that first month, everything flipped upside down. The verbal abuse began little by little. Not knowing the true scope of this abuse - I felt bad for him. He talked about how bad of a life he had, and that he suffers from mental illness. As time went on, he would blame everything on mental illness. We found out my sister was pregnant, and it only made everything so much worse. I decided to hire him at a store I was managing, just for him to mix alcohol and Xanax while on the job, causing him to black out and literally destroy my car while running around almost naked.

I am absolutely terrified that he will put his hands on my sister already. Every night, I hear her screaming and crying, while he is yelling at her while making violent threats towards my family. When we defend my sister, she denies that anything is wrong, while he continues to threaten us in a house that he lives in for free. She refuses to let us kick him out, because that's the father of her child and he apparently took her virginity, she ""loves"" him. I dont want to repeat anything that has been said because it is very triggering. My parents have no idea what is truly going on because they're deaf and can't hear the entiee context of the arguments/abuse. I absolutely cannot handle this anymore. He is SO disrespectful towards my mom - he has even said that he cheated on her because she was signing and driving at the same time?? (She was asking directions so he could sell percocets...) We have screenshots of him threatening us. Now that the baby has been born and hes a few months old, the mental abuse continues. He threatens to take the baby across the country to his family's house on a daily basis, yet leaves my mom, the same person he talks trash about every single day, to take care of the baby while my sister suffers from post partum depression. If he ever leaves, we want to move into a place that he will never find.

What do i do? How do I get him out of the house? We are all terrified of him.

My ex would binge drink about every other month, sometimes less, and verbally abuse me and or hit me.
Yes, I yelled and yeah, I broke my own things. Example: my little acoustic guitar.
Anyway, just here for support and to somehow come to terms why I allowed this person to abuse me for 5 years.
Hope I didn't break any rules and I'm glad I found this place.",domesticviolence,Anyone have an abuser say it was self defense?,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/gw0gwp/anyone_have_an_abuser_say_it_was_self_defense/,True

Without going into too much detail I'm a citizen of a country that opresses women and living in a country that opresses women. My father makes being a woman even harder with his strict religious rules and beliefs. I have been raised to be submissive while my whole being shouts for me to escape but I don't see how.

If i ever said where i lived no one would touch me with a 10 foot pole because there is nothing that can be done that will make my situation better in this country. Only a miracle would change my situation.

There is no support for abused or opressed woman in this country

I don't know how to escape or where to escape.

While I have no physical marks or bruises my inside is filled with the scars of emotional and physiological abuse. I need help but no where to turn to, no one to go to, no one to support me, no one who would listen.

Will I stay opressed my whole life? What's the point of living a life like that? I don't see any light at the end of the tunnel. It's dark all around",domesticviolence,I'm at a loss of what to do with my life,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/gw0nyu/im_at_a_loss_of_what_to_do_with_my_life/,True

Well, we are still texting a few times daily, so I am not technically out of the relationship yet, and perhaps won't for some time. However I am gradually starting to see the abusive patterns in our relationship, and view things as they really were.

I wasn't really wrong when I felt frustrated she couldn't understand it when I explained programming concepts to help her study. I always tried my best to constrain the frustration when teaching her, but she would always pick it out and lash out at me in return. I realize that I wasn't wrong when I repeatedly told her I was having doubts about the relationship, it was an attempt of open communication and it wasn't a sin, or that I was putting her down and deliberately making her feel inadequate. I wasn't really wrong when I wanted out, despite the fact that she followed me to a new country when I gave her a sort of ultimatum (""If you don't come to Canada, we'll have to break up."").

She is trying to layer all these guilt upon me, and even now, I still feel guilty and responsible for the above things I did.

I went back to the island one week ago, because I missed her like hell. I missed her so much that my heart felt weak and my hands trembled. It is funny, how I had been pondering breakup for the majority of the day, but ever since I really went out, I could miss her so much. My emotional dependence on her was undeniable. Every day she waited for me in front of the fireplace. She used to be so happy when I returned, and she would care about my life and health, cook for me, and listen to all the silly and the most out-of-the-world things I had to say. I missed having someone always there for me.

But the bad times, oh they were so bad. Her opinion of me shifts drastically during those episodes where she felt she wasn't ""understood."" She gaslights me (""No I haven't said that"", ""no I didn't do it"", blatantly tells me that my feelings are unimportant to her, tells me I am too needy, that all my future partners will cheat on me because of that, says that me and all my family are psychopaths, and that I won't have any achievements in life, that my pouring out my heart to her made her feel speechless, etc. That I am selfish, fake and have a weak soul.

The days pending the breakup which I initiated were the worst. She blamed me for all her problems, and accused me of not caring about her at all. She slapped, choked, kicked, bit, threw things at me, pushed me up against walls, and once pointed a knife at me. She would stand in front of my room at night with ""that look,"" refused to let me sleep and gave me verbal threats for half an hour, sitting at my bed and staring at the wall. In the daytime she kept talking to herself. I was so scared.

She is normal at most times and in front of others, especially now which is weeks after I left. I know she misses me as well, but not to such an extent as I missed her. She easily closes off her emotions, as she herself said, and according to articles of personality disorders. She would think of me randomly during the day, but I guess that's basically it.

I realize that it's going to be an uphill battle, perhaps filled with loneliness, but also filled with freedom. I know that going back to the island where I used to, and somewhat still, feel like it's a home, isn't the answer to all this. Last time I went, I relived the sweetest times, but then triggered one of her episodes and got slapped, blamed and threatened in return. I won't contemplate going back to her again. She is not likely to change in the following months and even years to come.

This is what I have been thinking about today, and I am posting this out to share with you all.",domesticviolence,Finally seeing the abuse as they really were.,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/gw165j/finally_seeing_the_abuse_as_they_really_were/,True

My wife was on the downhill of an abusive marriage when we met.  Initially we were just friends, but I made her feel better, so she could take more of his abuse but also stand up for herself more.  He had stopped being physically violent by that point, he's 6'3 265+, so for him it was more verbal and punching walls or threats since he had established he could best her up anytime he just had to remind her.

She hid most of it, but I became a huge issue for them and I got used to him calling to threaten me ect once she grew numb.

Fast forward a few years, she left, eventually we got married, good times.  But they had joint custody and he started back up, screaming at her (after convincing  her she couldn't record), threatening and intimidating ect.  It escalated into stalking while I was deployed and that's when she finally told me the whole history and it clicked just how violent he could get.  Cops wouldn't take it seriously (NC isn't too progressive), and I started learning how little the system knows about its own laws.  I got smarter, but it takes FOREVER to build a case on someone who now knows they are being watched, dozens of reports, cops know him it's just waiting for a big blowup now.  The assumption is I'm here to protect her now, problem is they also tell me how fast I'll get arrested for doing it.

Brings us to today.  We show up to drop her daughter off, in the police station parking lot like always.  Ex gets out with his mom.  Daughter walks over to grandma, they go to get in his van.  He's still standing there.  I say nothing, no eye contact, wait until my wife is in the car, and as I'm getting in he starts coming towards us.  I pull out my phone, start trying to record and he starts bowing up saying he wants to fight ect.  She's yelling how rediculous this is, tells me to just go.  His mom grabs him, we pull off.

Wife doesn't stop yelling though because......

SHE IS YELLING AT ME!!! 

Now shes mad because she thinks I instigated it.  Same guy that called to cancel her daughters counseling appointment yesterday, same guy who immediately started blowing her phone up about me today being there, like I always am, on and on.

She knows he's dangerous and violent, and uses any excuse to not let their daughter call (1 call on his time a month, maybe) but when does reality set in for her that what he's doing is controlling and he wants to isolate her, so trying to get along with him is a no win game.  He has repeatedly tried to lure her out alone for various reasons and even shown up at times when he doesn't think I'll be there.

It got to the point where he slammed me to the ground, the wall, and on the bed. He's choked me, pressed on my eyes, kicked and punched me. I know this all sounds ridiculous and anyone in their right mind would immediately know to switch gears and not care for this person. I don't know why I find myself still caring for this person. We had so much history together and he's tried to seek therapy himself but still repeats these behaviors. There were times where he was able to remain calm and asked that he leave so he could be in a better headspace to return and have civil conversations, but all that seem to go out the window when he snaps. 

 I don't like that I still care and miss him. I've blocked all contacts because I know that's what needs to happen because it got out of hand and he still tries to call me from an unknown number. Im afraid I might cave in one day and pick up. I know I shouldn't. Also, this is very embrassing to admit, but I can't help but desire our sexual chemistry again. I know that's not a healthy love, but i don't know how to wrap my head around why I feel the way I do. With this whole covid 19 shelter in place, it's been hard to get a support group going. I've already called the national domestic abuse hotline and they've linked me to my local group, but even they've haltered meetings and so I'm looking for any support I can get so that I don't go back into making the same mistakes again, thank you for taking the time to read this.",domesticviolence,How do I get myself to stop caring for my abuser?,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/gtn4cl/how_do_i_get_myself_to_stop_caring_for_my_abuser/,True

Yo shut the fuck up you troll! If you are really in trouble find a damn shelter. Don’t blame strangers for your mistakes. At least protect your son! If you’re with your abuser then that is your fault no one else’s! Walk to the damn gas station and get gas. You dumb bitch!""

ANOTHER PERFECT RESPONSE

""You know what lady, short of someone giving you cash, there is nothing to help your immediate situation. I’m guessing you conveniently ran out of gas far from resources.
Probably time to start waking to the nearest gas station with your kid and dog, and ask there if someone can help you. Sitting on your device arguing with people is a waste of time. Considering you have no gas, wonder what will happen when you have no access to internet? Batteries don’t last forever""

I'm posting those since the mods aren't doing shit. Trying to defend myself and everything gets locked. Rules only apply to certain people. Y'all do me a favor when the next mother/kid is killed by the abuser don't ask or say ""why didn't she just leave"". The abuser has already alienated the victim from friends and family and made sure there is no resources available to leave.

We've had serious issues here and there, I've been thrown out and left a bunch of times. She's cheated on me on Tinder 6+ times. She was always trashing me to her friends on social media. One of her friends egged her on to keep cheating on me. She almost left me for someone else once. Her adult son went crazy one morning, and threatened me with a knife, and stabbed our kitchen table.

Our issues stemmed from a bunch of different sources: her son (20) was a drug addict and a drug dealer who didn't clean up after himself. Her oldest daughter (23) was a drug addict that was also a cutter and was bulimic. Her younger daughter(18) was also a drug addict and later became a drug dealer. She had one son who was a good student in school who had no real issues. (19).

She was former Army going through a divorce with a somewhat indifferent husband who had moved on with a younger woman. I had been divorced 2 years, and was living alone, when she was involuntarily separated from the Army for high year tenure, and was about to lose her housing.

We had known each other in high school, but not well. We hung out a few times. In fact, I asked her to marry me when I was 18 and she was 16, but she said ""no"".

We began talking on Facebook Messenger, and she would go into another room and talk to me, for hours and hours. We got along great. Eventually she surprised me and came down to see me, December 26, 2014, and stayed for a while, until things got crazy back home. She bought me a car, as I had lost mine in some wrangling with my ex-wife during my divorce, an old.Buick, but hey, it was a car, and I loved her for helping me.

She left again in February,  but we reunited on Valentine's day for a Hozier concert in Seattle, which she arranged and paid for. She had gotten severance pay from the Army. She lived off this for a good while, and didn't work for around 3 months or more. 

It was a good time, and I loved her, but even then, I knew I couldn't please her. She had a huge sex drive, and I had suffered a bit from erectile dysfunction. I had some pills, but they were old, but I had underlying problems with my blood pressure and blood sugar that were causing problems.

Eventually, she moved back in with me, and we had a great life, just laughing and talking and spending time together. Her oldest daughter was living on her own in D.C., her youngest daughter and oldest son was living with her dad in San Antonio, and her younger son, the food student, came to live with us, and she brought her 3 dogs, 2 golden retrievers and a small terrier mix.

Eventually, things got bad at the exhusbands place, so the you get daughter and oldest son came to live with us in a small, 700ft 1 bedroom apartment. 

Eventually, we had to move. The daughter kept skipping school and getting the property management to let her in where they could see the 3 large dogs, so we were asked to leave, also based on occupancy. We had 5 people in there.

When we moved to the new neighborhood, my girlfriend asked her oldest daughter if she wanted to live with us, and she brought her Russian live-in boyfriend, and broke up with him on the same day, but he continued to live with us for a year. My girlfriend at this time was a nurse, so she make good money. I wasn't making very much, and I felt like such a mooch. I had paid all the bills at our old apartment, as I had when I lived alone, but I had little left over after child support was taken out. I helped where I could, I always did the dishes, the laundry, cleaning the whole house, vacuuming...I tried to make her life easier in ways that I could, since I couldn't help in financial ways. I loved her deeply, but I always felt a bit outnumbered and outvoted, and had no real say in anything.

A year or so later, I lost my job, and was unemployed for a year. I took great care of the house, but she despised my not working. She was paying for everything related to the house, and I was taking care of it, but I really wasn't that big of a burden, I was cleaning up after 4 kids that weren't mine, and one live in boyfriend, occasionally taking them to school when they missed the bus, or I would drive them to work. At some point, her oldest son began bringing drug addicts and derelicts around the house, and I had words with him about it. My girlfriend hated me disciplining her kids, but she wasn't doing it, either. She let them run all over her, cursing her out, calling her names, disrespecting her...something I put a stop to. You'd think she'd appreciate that, but she felt it was causing a problem in her relationship with her kids.

She began going on Tinder and hooking up with random guys for quickies. Once, she even let one guy watch once. She began seeing a guy named Jim, leaving me alone with her kids while she went to have sex with him. She would lie and say she was going to fo look at a table for sale or go to a thrift shop.

Things got real bad for a while, when the oldest daughter threw her boyfriend out, and turned to alcohol. She would get driven home by the bartender so they could go home. She would dump hundreds of dollars out on the ground and leave her cellphone, and new iPhone, in the street.

Her oldest son had gotten thrown out of two schools, and was now on his 3rd time as a senior. He and his friends stole a wallet from a truck at a nearby construction site, which brought the police to our home. They drew guns on me, demanding I turn him over. He wasn't even home. Our house became the bad house in the neighborhood where the cops were always called.

My girlfriend helped me find another job, and let me drive her truck, while she sold her car to her son so he could go to his academy school for special students across town. She was a nurse for the same company I worked for, though in different cities. We could communicate on Skype to one another all day. It was beautiful. I still didn't make enough ro support her, but I would come home, and clean, and do car repairs, and build projects for her. Anything she asked for.

Eventually, the youngest daughter became a problem, with drugs and alcohol and skipping school, and one got her boyfriend to try and run me over with his car,...and she moved back with her father. She moved back 6 months later, with a new drug habit, and was even worse. She was climbing in and out of windows, lying about working, and staying gone days at a time. The oldest daughter had herself committed, met a friend inside, tried to convince us the friend should move in, and got a job as a waitress in a strip club.  The oldest son kept bringing trashy friends over in the middle of the night, making our house smell like pot, and sneaking his younger sister out for parties. The oldest sister gave her alcohol and she almost killed herself with alcohol poisoning, and the police came, having been called because she had been drinking on Facebook Live.

The oldest son came home high, and shit in the backyard. My girlfriend confronted him, and he started acting like he was going to hit her. I shouted from upstairs, and he came up the steps at me with a knife. My girlfriend called the police, and he was arrested. She bailed him out, which caused a fight. We worked through that, she got him his own place, the youngest daughter found some drug counselor to live with, and my girlfriend had a fight with the oldest daughter when she came home drunk again, and the oldest daughter moved out, too, leaving just the good student son, who then found a friend to move out with, leaving just the two of us again.

My girlfriend had quit her job, and went back to college to be a doctor. It was hard and stressful. The truck died, and I had built up enough credit to buy a new car. My girlfriend bought two more cars, whixh i fixed up for her, was in accidents in both, and got one more last car.

Things were okay. She had too much time on her hands, and began starting fights when I came home because she wanted to do something and I was just trying to relax. I still couldn't match her libido. 

Eventually I come home, and she tells me she has started talking to a cousin she hadn't spoken to in 10 years. I don't think much of it at first, but she's going into closed rooms to talk to him. I catch a few screens of their chats online, and they're really suggestive for cousins. I mentioned it, and she said there was nothing to worry about.

She had been repairing her credit. She wanted to buy a house. Waived in an HOA, and the rent was terrible. She got her VA home loan, and we were preparing to move. We had found this house she loved because it was on a lot of land for her plants and dogs, and it had a handicap accessible bathroom off of the master bedroom, which she said she selected for me, because I have bad knees. It wasn't one floor, like we had talked about, but it was nice. It was older, and the wiring was crazy, and there were lots of things that needed to be done. It was a good project house, and I would be kept busy.

We're in the midst of moving and packing, and she's hiding in other rooms, talking to this ""cousin"". I eventually open the door, and ask just what is going on. This was similar to the way I was talking to her when she was about to move on from her ex-husband, so my suspicion was going off. 

For the scene I started, she broke up with me, and I was told it was over, that she didn't want me to move with her, al.ost like it was planned that way. She had a meeting with her kids, and had a chat with her friend that was always pushing her to leave me, that she was either going to not buy the house and just move in with her cousin, or buy the house and all the kids could move back in because apparently I was the problem, and now I was out of the picture. 

Her kids expressed interest, especially the older waitress daughter and the drug addict son. They hadn't had particularly successful stints living on their own.

I made one last ditch effort to save the relationship, and she relented. I was back in. She made the announcement to the kids, and the oldest waitress daughter flat out said it was a mistake, according to the relationship advice she read on Tumblr. 

We moved. Some days the kids would help. Most days they didn't. I unloaded 2 Uhaul trucks by myself. I was trying to do all the things my girlfriend always wanted me to do. I took my Viagra, even though it used to make me feel bad, and we started having sex 3 to 4 times a day. We were making bold plans for this new house. Her drug addict son moved in. The waitress daughter, too. I tried to make peace. They made their plans when I wasn't going to be here.

We were doing really great, except she was still talking to this cousin an awful lot, even talking calls when we were eating together or having a conversation. 

She had made some plans to visit this cousin and the rest of her family, supposedly. She wasn't forthcoming with the date, but apparently it was a plan put in motion in the brief period we were broken up.

About two weeks before the visit, she starts to go cold. She doesn't want sex anymore, because I had satisfied that craving. She didn't want to kiss me if I was too sweaty. She was pushing me away, and talking to him more. Evey time I said something about it, she said I was being insecure. 

Last Saturday, I ask when she was leaving. She said June 3rd. She said she didn't know when she was coming back. That was how it was when she came to stay with me, too. I said something about it. I asked if she was going to unblock me on Facebook (she had blocked me when we broke up), so I could chat with her all the time when she was with him, like he was foing when she was with me, or if I was her dirty little secret.

She got up and left for an hour. Then she suggested we unpack some boxes in the bedroom together. She starts saying she never goes out, never gets to wear these pretty dresses. I don't take her anywhere nice. She leaves again for four hours this time. She comes back and tells me not to bother unpacking my things. ""There's no trust, no respect, and you hate my kids"".

I was floored. It wasn't even an argument. It was if her mind was made up by someone else. She was dead cold, and wanted nothing to do with me. I began packing my things back up again.

I try to make peace. Nothing. I try to ask her daughter what I should do, and I notice her daughter is saying the same things her mother said. I had accused her of a crime, of incest, and that was insulting. 

It gets to a point where I'm ready to leave, apparently for good. My ex-girlfriend says she was going to offer for me to stay until I found a place, if i fixed up her house with all the things i had planned to while she was gone, and maybe she would miss me, and maybe we could talk when she got back, whenever that was. Her oldest daughter was hiing to move out in a month, her oldest son was going to move in with his dad in two months, she needed someone to watch her dogs.

I agreed. At least it was a small glimmer of hope, and I had a place to stay, and didn't have to drastically alter my life. I was still heartbroken she was going to leave with our relationship in shambles.

There were little hints she still cared. She cracked jokes with me. I collect Transformers and she still went down the aisle and would tell me what they had. She had watched on our Ring cam and saw me throw away a McDonald's bag, so she knew I was eating, despite being heartbroken. 

I had made about of changes last time we broke up. I was making more now. I changed my debit pin to her birthday, like she always wanted. I made my Facebook profile pic a pic of us together. I was going to a therapist. I was looking into getting my disability pay increased. I was in line for a transfer and a promotion. I had found a program that would pay me to take care of her for her disability, that would make up in the money she was losing from college. She was using the GI Bill, but Covid was keeping her home in a virtual class, and that gave her extra time, and she spent that extra time talking to her cousin. I had told her I had some paperwork to fill out, and I had an interview the next day, and they money would be enough to cover the mortgage or my half of the combined bills. Finally, I was going to be able to contribute in a meaningful way. I had given her sex, and she still canned me. Now I was about to give her a large amount of money. 

I came home, and she was mowing the grass. She was looking very sexy, wearing this black top I always thought looked good. I told her I needed to talk to her, she said she'd come inside when she was finished. I thought for sure shed be happy, and consider taking me back. When we had talked earlier about all they ways I helped her, it almost seemed like she had gone soft again, and realised I really did love and care for her, and showed it in the best ways I could. 

I went upstairs and saw her laptop was open. I moved the mouse, it was on Facebook. I looked at the chat. There it was.

A lurid sex chat with her cousin. She was talking about it gushing like Hoover dam, and about how she couldn't wait to be with him. There were nudes exchanged. A video chat. He said she went three deep. She said it tasted great. It was perverse. It was dirty. It was very much like the sex we had the month before.

Her daughter had told me there was nobody else and I was an asshole for accusing her of a crime, something my girlfriend echoed later, letting me know the daughter had planted the seeds of the breakup. She had even said she wanted all of her mother's attention and felt she couldn't get that when we were doing well together, but here it was: she was chatting with someone else, and that someone else was her cousin, and it was incest. 

I wasn't crazy. I knew it all along. She just kept me for the move. She just kept me for the labor. Now she was going to go fuck her cousin after breaking up with me so she could justify and legitimize it and say it wasn't cheating because we weren't together. 

I called her into the kitchen and confronted her with what I saw. She immediately grew irate. She demanded I delete it from my phone. I refused. She said ""You're going to ruin me! Destroy me!""

She went into the bedroom. I took this chance to leave. When she came out of the bedroom, she had her gun in her hand. I went into the garage. She locked and loaded the gun behind me. It was a Walther PPX. There was no safety. That gun was ready to fire.

She shoved my back, forcing me into the dryer. I shoved her away, and went for the door...I went out and through the gate and felt the gun in my back. I spun around to get by her and close to my car. She stopped me, and kicked at my bad knee twice, then thrust her knees toward my knee or groin. She grabbed at the pocket for my phone. I dodged all her attacks, and was holding the gun back with one hand. She kept saying my name. I asked what she was afraid of. She shoved the barrel of the gun into my chest, I felt the barrel was right at my heart. There was anger and evil in her eyes. I heard her say my name through pursed lips and clenched teeth. I heard her finger on the trigger.

We were now at the end of the driveway. I had always told her, she or her son was one day going to kill me, and to save jail time, say it was suicide. It would be believable. I've been depressed since our breakup, and everyone knew that.

I couldn't get to my car. It was too far to go anywhere by foot to be out of range. I had accepted it: I was about to die.

Then i saw a young woman on the sidewalk across the street, and shouted out ""Please hell.me, she's going to kill me, she has a gun! Please call 911!"" and the young woman did, and reported what she saw.

The police came, and arrested my ex-girlfriend for aggravated assault with weapon, and battery, and I left alone, heartbroken, and confused.",domesticviolence,"Caught girlfriend cheating in chat, she pulled a gun",https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/gtrna2/caught_girlfriend_cheating_in_chat_she_pulled_a/,True

Mason County, WV

Thursday, March 12, 2020
10:05 PM

I went to hangout with Chad. Just to have a good time, hang out.
Little did I know I was walking into the story of my own attempted murder.
Everything was going great. We were having a great time. For the first week anyway.
He kept trying to get me to message his ex. He thought I knew where she was at. He thought I had his phone tapped and that I was working for the feds, and was trying to set him up. I couldn't give him any answers either and that started pissing him off. My last week with him was pure hell.. torture. Literally.
It started one morning, he'd been up all night. Picked me up by my throat, started choking me. Hit me a few good times. Then while I was down started pressing his knee into my chest. Told me he'd just keep doing that until I stopped breathing. That it would look like I had a heart attack. No one would know any different.
He wouldn't let me leave at this point. Threatened my family. Took my phone. Even started messaging my friends and everyone. That night he was supposed to go see his mom at the hospital and made me go.
Going down Route 2 he continued hitting me. So I opened my door and tried to jump out but he grabbed my hair and pulled me back in. I kicked and fought but he was stronger than me. That's when he took me down by the river. Saying everything would be fine and he'd let me live if I would just tell him the truth and answer his questions.
But I didn't have his answers. So I was beat some more. He was going to kill me and throw me in the river.
Then he said that would be too easy. No, he was gonna keep me alive and torture me until I gave him answers.
So we went back to his house.
Monday, March 9, 2020 is the day he slipped. One small mistake.
He took me to St. Mary's in Huntington, WV with him so he could visit his mom. Told me to wait in the truck.
Soon as he turned the corner and was out of sight I took off. Ran to the emergency room while I had 911 on the phone telling them what was going on.
I'm safe for the time being. But I'm terrified.. if he finds me, I'm dead.

I’m not sure how to start this but I’ll give a bit of background. Basically I’m a male and I met my ex in my final year of uni and I think I was swept away by the fact that she was smart, wealthy, etc etc and couldn’t believe that she actually wanted to be with me. She was great with my friends at first and when I graduated and wanted to stay in the city, I was happy to take up her offer of living with her until I found my own place and the following year we would move closer to my hometown where she would study for her masters degree. This is where it all changed...

(Sorry guys, on reread this is quite long so feel free to just skip to the last paragraph if you want to see my question)

Over the next two years she became increasingly violent and aggressive. She would dig her nails into my arm and punched me in the head on several occasions. Once, I put my arm up in self defence and it caused a bruise on her wrist which she would constantly use against me to make me feel like a bad person. My friends who she liked at first became “bad influences” and just the mention of them would flare up arguments so eventually it became easier not to see/mention them to avoid this. She changed the plan to move near to my hometown without telling me by enrolling for her masters at the same uni. Near the end of the relationship my mental health was struggling, especially following the death of my grandad and I wanted to seek counselling which she wouldn’t allow me to because I’d be a “weirdo”. I finally found the strength to leave her when she said she was going for dinner with friends and by chance I spotted her having a romantic meal with another guy.

I have too many instances of abuse and those are just some that I can pull from the top of my mind and I know that they’re not half as bad as what some have experienced on this thread. I’ve since moved back to my hometown and my friends have welcomed me back with open arms which I don’t deserve. I’ve also met the girl of my dreams who is the most intelligent person I’ve ever met, so understanding, supportive and exactly what I’ve always wanted in a partner. We own a house together and are due to be married next year.

The point I’m trying to make is that I often find myself feeling bitter towards my ex and all of those years that she has taken from me. I often think about the fact that she is free to do what she wants and that some poor guy is probably being abused by her right now and that could be down to me. I’m not sure that there’s much I can do now and I’ve tried to help friends who seem to show signs of being in controlling relationships but it never seems to scratch the itch. I also want to stop feeling like my friends secretly hate me for abandoning them. I thought that this would subside over the years but I find myself here after 5 years just as bitter as ever and wondering what I can do to move forward.",domesticviolence,5 years on and the abuse from my ex still affects me?,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/gtvalb/5_years_on_and_the_abuse_from_my_ex_still_affects/,True

Since the lockdown, victims of domestic violence have become even more vulnerable. Have you ever considered what abuse does to a child’s soul? What it is like to survive years of abuse, and process the trauma to become able to live a balanced adult life?
While Hungarian politicians keep humiliating women in public, Hungary has recently said no to the Istanbul Convention, which protects women and children from abuse. The real reason behind this decision is not that the country is completely prepared to help victims and prevent violent acts, nor is it the foreign policy (migration) arguments the government proposes, but their total indifference to the problem.
However, this is a problem that knows no country borders and appears everywhere. Come with us on May 31st, children’s day – let’s stand up for those who need protection the most!

He's schizophrenic but also violent and would assume my other brother Tony or my dad would be hooking up with his wife.  

One of my other brother's Tony was outside throwing some trash away at night and my brother Luis started shouting at him saying that my brother fucked his wife, even though Tony has a girlfriend. They ended up fighting and Tony had bloody cuts on him from the fight. They stopped once my dad pulled them apart.

The day after my brother ended up chocking his wife and almost killing her. He left bruises on her arm. She said she would call the cops and he ended up running away into the street.

He came back later threatening us if we called the cops and saying his wife was reading our minds. I ended up kicking him because he was getting close to me.

The police came by because someone called. I ran to them and told them my brother had abused and almost killed his wife. They talked to me and asked me what had been going on. My brother's wife denied the abuse and the bruise, but I told them that it was in fact caused by my brother. They took him away, although my brother did try fighting the police at some point.

They have 3 kids who have witnessed the violence going on, who will be telling the court what they witnessed. 

My brother is in jail for a bit before they do the court stuff but I'm really scared as he now is out to get me. 
I'm glad I told the police because my mom and my brother's wife kept denying the abuse.

I just hope he goes to jail forever. 
He's on parole and has 2 strikes already, so hopefully if he's charged with domestic abuse I don't have to fear him coming to kill me.

This has been so stressful and even though I wasn't being abused, I know how violent my brother is and how mad he was when my mom told him that the police talked to me.

I am very confused right now. My bf (26) of two years threw a clothes horse at me (23) two weeks ago.

 I have met this guy at my university in a very depressing time of my life. I grew up with my grandparents, my parents left me alone as a child, my dad abandoning me two times for two years. My grandpa had just passed away. I started going to therapy, which I am still doing and it helped me a lot, but he also helped me and was there for me, then I needed to cry and was very caring and empathetic. In fact he helped me heel a lot.

I really fell in love with him and wanted to become the best version of my self, kind and mindfull and empathetic. I was ready to work on every issue we had, learn to communicate better, meet his needs and be there for him...

So here is the thing, he always gets very upset and angry over small things. He starts crying then he has to do something in the household, so I end up doing it. I think he is a workaholic. He works up to ten hours every single day... In our two years of relationship he took like three weeks off. He says he feels empty and depressed then he is not working. He can't fight. Every time we have an argument, he rather leaves the room or stares at his phone. Two times he had punched a wall in front of me, blaming me for it. ""I push his buttons"". Then he started throwing stuff against the wall. He won't talk to me until I apologize for the argument (It is normally just me pointing out small things, that hurt or bother me). 

This time it was about my grandmothers birthday. I wanted to visit her and for him to come along. He struggled a said, that he would rather work. I got really sad and told him that it makes me said he doesn't care and he had an outburst and threw the clothes horse at me. I raised my arm and it left a scratch. Then he went silend and I packed my things and went away.

He then wrote a really long letter apologizing and we agreed to talk again a few weeks from then, after cooling down. And I don't know what to do. If I should try to work things out, find another way to solve our problems or just leave it and suffer a bit. I know that no relationship is perfect and that everthing needs work...

So here is the thing. I kind of know he can be very kind and creative and playfull and he really helped me. I don't want to hurt him and a part of me is excusing all this I guess. Like he is very stressed, works very hard, his mom has a depression and his parents really are always fighting, even getting violent... And I really have compassion for him and don't want things to end. On the other hand... It is not only this. He is so disrespectfull with my creative work, insulted my believes... One time he wanted me to write a two page essay, explaining why my policial opinion on a topic is wrong (It wasn't just the same as his). 

He cares a lot about what people think and gets upset then I am joking around with my friends and having fun, like just dancing around with my best friend Eva. He sais that this embarases him. 

Don't know... Could it all just get worse? Am I co-depended? Don't know... A part of me believes it is all my fault, that I am being to harsh, then expressing my concerns... I can get very sad sometimes, too and just lie in bed a cry. I also get angry, then he insults me... But I never try to harm him on purpose and I am trying to grow as a person and communicate better every time... Also noting that my dad is a narcissist and he wrecked my judgedment of people and situations... I feel so brainwashed.",domesticviolence,My boyfriend threw a clothes horse at me,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/gu1mrq/my_boyfriend_threw_a_clothes_horse_at_me/,True

How can I help her?

Background -
We used to work together but have gone on to work for different companies. I have seen bruises and various cuts on her face, she said the abuse started with a ""playful"" dead arm or dead leg when arguing, then gradually got worse to a slap and then punches and kicks and even household items being used. 

This lady has 3 young children, one of the main reasons why she wont tell the police is the fear of her children being taken away from her.

I want to help, I don't know how to help.
What can I do? Are there any resources I could give to her to help?

It's been years of torment as we lived together and he has said he couldn't afford to move out (has had issues holding down a steady job throughout the years). I've kicked him out 2x before  but he ended up coming back. He never hit me but has been verbally and emotionally abusive over the years-telling me things like 'don't get me angry or I'll blow up' over the smallest things, and calling me every name in the book. He's destroyed many of my household items or he's threatened to if I don't do something he's asked right that minute. I already have issues with anxiety and he just raises it through the roof at times. I jump at loud noises because I now equate it with him blowing up and getting ready to damage something of mine. For a while I had issues with I think it's called dissociative disorder. I would look in the mirror or look at my hands and not feel like they were mine. He's even told me I should commit suicide and told me a way to do it (I am not suicidal and would never do that).

 I finally went on a domestic abuse website for help and spent 2hrs on a chat. The person sent me resources I could look over and and they helped me devise a plan to start the motions of getting him out of my apartment. Unfortunately, not even 1/2 hr later I had to text 911 for help as he threatened me, pulled a knife from the kitchen and started stabbing the couch, and then told me to keep quiet. 

He's been arrested and held. I feel relief, sadness, shock, and guilt. He definitely has some mental issues that he refused to get help with (refused to see any doctors, wouldn't go for annual check up, wouldn't even sign up for health insurance) I'm afraid of the whole process going forward and what will come next (which is why it took me so long to call, and why his sister likely never called). I'm sad that it had to come to this and wish we could've just peacefully separated. He's said off and on throughout our relationship that he wanted to leave, and then would eventually just terrorize me.

 I feel guilt because he doesn't have the means to rent and I'm not sure where he will end up. I know this is his fault and that it's not something I should worry about, but it's something the weighs on me now.

I also feel relief because I finally told my parents what's been going on. They don't live in the area but they offered to drive up to make sure I was ok (we had plans set for mid-june and that was when I was hoping to work on his moving out process).",domesticviolence,Abusive boyfriend arrested.

I have since moved on and got with an amazing man who has not even a shred of abusive tendencies in him. I love him more than I thought was possible - it's made me realise I don't think I ever loved my ex, only co-dependency feelings.   
I had not liked or really even tolerated my ex partner for a very long time, but I'd given up hope and so stayed, as we have a kid together.   
Eventually I saw behaviours in our child that I did not like (clearly mirroring his dad), and so I found the strength to get rid for good. I still have to have some contact with my ex, for obvious reasons. He has much more control over my life at this point, than I expected. I have so much regret that I even met him.  


Anyway, my issue is anger. I feel so angry with him all the time. Absolutely furious. Every day, all day, I have his voice in my head insulting me, criticising me and picking arguments. I then end up arguing back or defending myself. When I say voice I don't mean as in psychosis that I think it is real - it's just my thoughts, like day dreaming. This person has caused me so so so much damage, both emotionally and practically. I don't want him to continue causing me this much pain and anger on a daily basis, but my brain seems stuck in 4F mode.   


How on earth do I calm this anger?   
I have some grounding exercises to do, but it is often when I am doing housework or cooking, and so it's difficult to do the grounding stuff at that time. I end up in tears all the time. I have had severe depression for a very long time now, mostly due to certain things he controls in my life. I've tried to use music for distraction when I have to do these things, but it's not really doing much.

Within the first few months, he had slapped me very hard a few times, the first being after I said Usher was sexy. He told me not to disrespect him like that. 
At 6 months together we moved in together, and things changed a lot. I had moved 4 hours away from my family of be with him since he moved for work. I was attending college but eventually stopped. We didn't have internet so I stayed at home pretty much all day. I would clean and do my make-up and wait for him to be home. 
When he was home, he would basically ignore me, or insist that I perform oral sex on him, which I didn't mind, but if I said I didn't want to, he would berate me, sometimes hurt me, definitely forced it a bunch of times. 
I will say that I have a kink which is being forced, but a lot of the time, I wasn't into it and asked him to stop. He didn't. And if I cried he enjoyed it even more.
If he was annoyed by my fighting sometimes he would stop and throw me to the floor, calling me useless. (This has never stopped btw, 15 years in and he still does it). 
One night he came home from being at a bar with his sister (I was 18 and couldn't go). He was in a bad mood, I could tell. I tried to be nice but because he was so drunk, he wanted to have sex. He was having... difficulties...and said it was because I was overweight. I told him he could hurt me, (I'm a masochist and he's a sadist) and that helped, but he took it too far. He raped me and beat me for 4 hours. I know because I kept focusing on the digital clock on the bedside table. Bright red numbers counting the minutes of my terror.
A month after that I left, but 4 months of being with a worse guy and basically being homeless, I begged him to come save me. He showed up, got me off the drugs I was addicted to, and held me through my withdrawals. I suffered a miscarriage also, I didn't even know I was pregnant. He was so caring and sweet, and had done a lot of maturing while we were broken up.
We get an apartment together and it's like a fairytale. We don't fight, don't argue, we were madly in love again. We lived there for a year and it was great. Then he lost his career, we moved to a different apartment, and he started drinking heavily. We had a friend living with us and he drank with him all day and night..I'm talking they finished off entire handles each, and he started being controlling again. I had to keep the house clean and cook every meal for him and our roommate. He would punch my leg and keep digging his thumb into the bruise if I didn't do what I was supposed to do. He hated when I hung out with friends, and constantly accused me of cheating. At the time, Myspace was still a thing and he had numerous girls on there who he would go spend time with...I have since found out he was cheating.
After I finally kicked out roommate out for bringing over people who would steal from us, he sobered up and his behavior stopped being so bad. He would romance me and things got better. 
We got another place since we were kicked out of that place (long story) and though he was still very controlling thing calmed down again. 
Now I want to say that I love this man with everything I have. He doesn't react with rage, he doesn't beat me into a corner, he doesn't do what I consider to be abuse. Not since that first year together. But, in the 15 years we've been together, he goes through stages of being aggressive towards me. He insults me, forces sex or sexual acts, and then it stops. For months at a time sometimes. It's gotten to the point where I don't know how to feel normal. It's almost like I want him to be like that because it feels like our normal...? Does that make sense?? Not to mention that it has severely affected my sexual pleasure, I can't seem to enjoy myself if he isn't being aggressive or at least demeaning me in some way. It's something he's always done, and I don't know how to ""get off"" without it.
Flash forward to 2011, we moved again, again away from my family and friends, and again I try to go to school, and he gets a good job. But as before, I stop going to school and stay home all day. I clean, I cook, etc. We would rarely go out to town or anything, we were always home. He started to be a little more aggressive more often. Randomly. I didn't know what would set it off. One time I had a black eye, a very mild one, but it was there. He took me out to eat and go shopping, after making me do my makeup so it wasn't visible. While out he asked me how it felt to know people had no idea that he hurt me like that since we look so happy. I didn't know what to say but he put my hand on his crotch and he was as hard as a rock. 
Later he held me down and forced himself on me while slapping me harder than before on the same side where the bruise was. 
We lived out there for almost 10 years. This behavior became more frequent and more intense. My entire life became centered around him and what he liked or didn't like. My appearance, my housekeeping, everything. But again it wasn't like what I believed abuse to be. I've seen in movies or heard about it from people and it just seemed more dramatic and violent than what he would do. What he did was always cool and calm, he did it with such ease and confidence, I kept telling myself it was a game, he did it to turn himself on, because he's a sadist. We played around with bondage, role played, all the normal BDSM stuff so I just thought it was part of it. 
He'd do it for a while, constantly, then as before, he would just stop. And again I felt myself needing it. I'd need him to hit me, or be mean to me. I found myself feeling anxious or uneasy if he wasn't being dominant and mean. So I would ask. And if I brought up that I felt he went too far and said maybe this was abuse and not good, he would laugh and say I asked for it....which I did. 
So it was something I wanted...
Here I am, almost 16 years together with him and now it's scary. Again his drinking got bad and he has been doing it more. But it's different now. Now I tell him I don't want it. I cry. I fight. I break down and he just keeps doing it. He says he doesn't care that I don't want it. I tell him I'm afraid of him and he smiles and says good. He'll get drunk and throw me to the ground if I say something he considered too sassy or bitchy. He doesn't always hit me, but he holds me down and says awful things to me. He makes me cry. He reminds me I have nowhere to go. That if I leave I would just go running back to him because I can't do anything right, (I have some issues so he's not wrong) and that no other man would ever be able to deal with my baggage and no one would want an overweight woman in her 30s. The sad thing is he's right. He uses me past against me when he wants to make me cry. 
And every time he does this he gets hard. He can't help but touch himself as he's either hurting me or demeaning me and insulting me. He loves doing it. 
I love him. I know I do because we've been through so much and we really are like best friends. We understand each other so well, we have been so close since the day we met. And I have my own problems. I take responsibility for him getting a taste for hurting me, because I was curious about BDSM and that stuff when we were first dating, but I never imagined he was actually abusive. Or is this abuse? I don't have bruises all over my body, I don't cower in a corner, although I have before, he doesn't beat me senseless... it just doesn't feel like the abuse we all know about from ads and movies, etc. 
I don't fear for my life because he doesn't lash out like that, he hasn't escalated like I assume he should have by now,... IDK what to call this. 


Honestly I'm not sure why I'm sharing this because I have no intention of leaving him, he's my world. I am happy with him. My day to day life is good, we laugh all the time.

We use to live with friends in a house then spent time at his moms. My bf and I have been together for 2 years. He has gotten physically violent by moving me or shoving me out of the way before we were in the one bedroom but never anything that crazy ridiculous. I take his stuff like his mouse or his charger and hide it when he would ignore me or stonewall me after a fight. He says I took him for granted so that's why he had to get away from me or zone out. We got a one bedroom so he could have his own space because he doesnt trust me to respect his space. It's TRUE I guess. When I wanna talk with him or discuss a fight, he just stonewalls for like a day or a week or a month. It's gotten better now he just disappears to his moms for a whole 24 hours... at one point he took my phone during a fight so I took his stuff and told him give it back or I'm gonna throw it and I did and I felt awful I havent hurt any of his thing since because I really never wanted to hurt anything of his but he had pushed me around and shoved me to the ground and said horrible things to me then took my phone and it was bad. About a 2 month ago hes got into it with his brother and his brothers friend at a a party at his moms and after he pinned his brother to the wall his brother followed him and they went back to our place so his sister gave me a ride. He texted me sorry. During the fight he got mean towards me because I was telling him to calm down. All he did was text me sorry. And when I got back the next evening I tried to talk about it with him and he was like ""why do I owe you anything"" and we got into a fight and again I wouldnt give him his space and I poked the bear as I always do and he throw me down and he covered my mouth and my nose so I couldnt breath... he also laid down on my head so my head was stuck between him and the floor btw my bf is a big guy like 250lb 6 feet tall huge linebacker. I am 5 feet tall 124lb Now here i am a few months later. I hid his keys so he couldn't leave I followed him every time he did try to leave and after all that when I wouldn't give him space in his room he shoved me he held me down hes hit me ""not that hard"" he said. Hes dragged me around by my hair or my feet he held me down and grabbed my breasts just to be disrespectful and he broke all of my art on my walls because I moved stuff around in his room to get his attention. Hes pressed my head into the ground and called me awful names and held my jaw closed so I couldnt scream. Covered my face multiple times. He kept hold me down and I always struggled and it hurt my arm and my back he stretched my leg and covered my mouth so I could cry while he pushed it upwards he grabbed me by my neck and pinned in weird backwards position .My shoulders hurt my body hurts my face hurts, not bad but it hurts. Hes left barely any Mark's but there are Mark's on my face and my neck. He kept hurting my eye while trying to cover my mouth. I called the police they showed I covered for him because none of this wouldve happened if I didnt poke the bear. I pushed his button I did whatever I knew I could to push his buttons. Idk why...idk why I do these things to trigger him I just want his attention I want him to care...idk oh I gave him his keys he left but all his stuff is here.",domesticviolence,It's my fault I poked the bear,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/guvkmg/its_my_fault_i_poked_the_bear/,True

But the last time we had an argument, it wasn’t even over anything important, he grabbed me and pulled me to the floor by my hair twice, covered my mouth and nose so I couldn’t breath, I bit my lip somewhere in all this so hard it was bleeding, and then he broke through the door to a locked room when I was trying to leave the situation.

I know this isn’t good and I need to leave, I haven’t been able to sleep since this has happened because all I can think about is what do I do? I feel like I have nowhere to go. We’ve been together about 4 years and we live in a house his family owns, which he doesn’t let me forget, he says it’s his house, when we argue he screams at me to leave when he knows I’ve got nowhere to go. I pay my share of the bills and do all housework because he refuses, I buy pretty much everything for the house. There are multiple holes in the walls where he has punched them in the past, I keep trying to patch them up.

When he’s finished arguing he will go back to saying how much he loves me and how he didn’t mean anything he said. 

Just after the above happened he said if he found out I told anyone what happened he would kill me. When we weren’t arguing he said he hopes I never tell anyone because in his words ‘there’d be lynch mobs going after him’ this came up after someone on Facebook invited him to like a page that was showing support for a girl who’s boyfriend had killed her .. he didn’t like that, he tried to justify what he does and says how he isn’t abusive. He was just trying to stop me screaming, or i shouldn’t have done something. 

I’ve been thinking about leaving and how I would do it but I feel like I can’t leave and rent somewhere because I have pets that’s I don’t want to leave behind, I’d have to wait until I can get enough money together anyway. should I tell someone I trust what’s happened in case it gets worse while I find somewhere else to live? What about when I do find somewhere to live, how do I tell him? Is this something I can report or have I left it too long, it’s been just over a week? I haven’t slept properly since this happened because I’m just worrying constantly. I feel like the whole situation is so much worse because we can’t really go anywhere at the minute and it’s so overwhelming.",domesticviolence,"Just need to get this off my chest really, could use some advice..

I haven't told anyone this but I suspect I was/am in an abusive relationship. Everything was fine the first three months but I spent a lot of time with him due to me recently having a sexual trauma and his bed was the only place I felt safe. He always told me it was fine and he was happy with me being there all the time, but there were small red flags. Blaming me for ""having sex"" before him (he was a virgin and before we were official, I had told him I wasn't even though now I don't see it as me having had sex before since it was coerced). He would punch the wall and get unnecessarily angry. He's had a rough childhood (experiencing neglect and I suspect he may have witnessed abuse too) so I just thought he was justified. I stopped hanging out with my friends and going out because he would make me feel bad and ignore my calls if I went out or give me the silent treatment when I came back after a night out, and he would shame me into wearing less revealing clothes. Some of the stuff that happened early on I can't remember because I think I tend to repress the arguments and verbal abuse because they happened often. Anyways, as we got closer and our relationship got older, he stopped liking me being around all the time and said he needed space. I should have complied, but it really hurt me to see a 180 from wanting me there 24/7 to not much at all. One night he went out with his friends without me and some girl kissed him (thats the story...idk what really happened and his friends are totally fine with cheating as he made me aware). After that I had trouble trusting him, but he had exhibited trust issues even before I did because within the first day of us dating he fought with me because I wouldn't let him go through my phone. I (and I know this is not ok behavior I'm not saying it is) started going through his phone after that because I felt a loss of security in our relationship and he was no longer really paying me compliments, being affectionate, expressing interest in sex, etc. I became depressed (I also suspect I have BPD and strong abandonment issues) and I told him, but he was not really supportive of me getting help or recognizing my trauma. He always thought I had no reason to be sad as I was financially comfortable and came from what appears on the outside to be a semi-normal family whereas he has struggled. We started to argue as he no longer tried to make an effort in our relationship and stopped seeming to care about me which really upset me. I really can't remember the first time he got physical with me as we used to ""play fight"" but sometimes he was a little more aggressive than I could handle (I'm a pretty small girl for reference like 100-110 pounds) but would apologize immediately after if I was hurt. Then one time he got angry in my car about something and slapped or punched me (again I think I blocked it out because all I remember was holding my face after and being hurt but with no real visible injury). After that, when he would get aggressive with me or really verbally mean I would slap him on the back almost as hard as I could (which again I feel ashamed of). Our fights became really frequent (sometimes 2-4 a week) where he would tell me to shut up or insult me and I would cry my eyes out so much that he would put a pillow over my head or cover my mouth so his roommate didn't hear me. The most escalated incident happened 2 months ago where he came home from going out with his friends and I was upset that he didn't check in on me and cuddle with me like he promised he would when he got back and I kept calling and texting him while he was in his roommates room because I was feeling anxious and depressed so I walked over to the roommates room and he (what I feel) humiliated me telling me to go away. I then went back to his room and attempted to cut myself for the first time and when I revealed to him that I did it, he told me I was psychotic and had no reason to do so, then when I cried he covered my mouth and neck with his hands, called me a dumbass, then told me he was going to sleep and didn't want to deal with my craziness. I was upset and so I shined my flashlight on him from beside the bed and he picked me up and threw me across the bed so hard it left a bruise because I hit a doorframe where my eyebrow bone is. He did not apologize or offer help after this and when I asked him for ice he screamed at me no. I kept crying until he got me ice and then when I realized it was wrong and wanted to document what happened and seek help, he took my phone, deleted the pictures, then held my phone overnight under his pillow and would not let me have it. I never sought medical attention for that and now I have headaches every day, and even though he took me on a date and told me it was an accident the next day, I still don't forgive him. I know I've engaged in some not healthy behavior probably some from my BPD such as tracking his location, going through his phone, and asking him to hang out with me instead of his friends (ones that told him it was ok to cheat on me). Do you think we're both at fault for this? He's all I have and I'm too ashamed to tell anyone what happened because they would just tell me to leave. I'm so attached to him though and even though we've broken up multiple times and gotten back together, I can't physically get myself to leave without wanting to die. What is wrong with me. If you asked me a few years ago if I thought this would ever be my life, I'd say hell no. I guess some of this is just daddy issues. Any comfort or opinions would be appreciated. Sorry again.

I also feel confused because he goes back and forth saying he doesn't love me anymore and doesn't want to be with me, to basically saying that didn't happen or he only says ""xyz"" because he's angry? I feel like I've been gaslit a lot as he's called me crazy at least 5 times and a cry baby almost every day. I know some of my behaviors were wrong, and I'm currently in therapy trying to work through my abandonment issues. But anything I ask him to do to help me he just ""can't"". Even something as simple as texting me once a day just to say hi or that he loves me. He's a terrible communicator. I hate him and I love him and I hate that I love him and that the person who makes me feel safe also makes me feel unsafe.",domesticviolence,I would like some help or insight...

He spent 89 days in the NICU where he was air lifted soon as he was born. They wanted to air lift me before I delivered so he would have been born with all the NICU staff and doctor's there but I delivered WAY to fast. He made it after a long LONG hard battle in the NICU with breathing and lung complications and heart problems he has to have surgery soon to repair a hole in his heart. He also has a umbilical hernia but that's not super important yet.  They released him 13 days ago to go home and I was completely shocked because we were told it would be June before they considered it..but at 9:00am I got a call from his nurse saying the neonatologist decided to release him with a heart monitor. 

LONG STORY SHORT I was so excited to get my baby boy home so no more traveling three hours to the hospital to see him. I went and got my boy and bring him home And my three older kids were so happy to see their brother and meet him because they haven't got to get because of the coronavirus. 

Well that night my husband got home from work and I thought he would be excited about our baby being home but NO he seemed ill and as the night went on he got so upset and I had no clue why but he started yelling at me because I had not cooked supper instead I picked up take out because I was traveling to get our son and didn't have time. He got louder and louder and he grabbed me and hit me in my left jaw and then when I failed he kicked me 3 times in my belly and the just walked off got in his truck and left. I called the police and made a report and went to hospital for evidence and safety. They caught him later that night driving drunk.

My mom and dad have been together for over twenty years. Every one of those twenty years, my mom has paid the price for seeing good in a damaged person.

My dad came from a broken family and a background of poverty. His dad died when he was a kid, and his mom remarried. Her husband left them after a few years and my dad had to support his mom and two stepbrothers by himself. Left home when he was 15 to work for them. Even after he came to Australia, he'd been sending money home, usually in thousands. This resulted in many arguments, yelling matches and physical abuse. My mom had been tolerating this because she had nowhere to go, no family in the country we live in. This happened up until last year when he promised to never lay a hand on her, and his mom died, so we thought it was over. 

It wasn't. I became the victim of his physical abuse, and mum was now being tortured emotionally. She defended me against him, and he kicked her out of her bedroom and she now has to sleep on a double bed with my other two siblings. Just last week, we went to get help, but mom doesn't want to separate. Mom's holding out, hoping we could get him to change. She reckons he's not a bad person, just doesn't have any control. She's waiting for an apology and an invite back to her own bedroom. It's been four weeks. I think dad wants an apology for her defending me.

I don't know how much more of this I can take. My sisters are innocent and their childhood is being ripped out from under their feet while I can only watch. My mom blames us three for her predicament.  She takes her bitterness out on us. She doesn't know the pain she's causing them from her statements and I'm completely torn. I already have anxiety from my own childhood and I don't want it to happen to them. I'm a good student and I can't concentrate on my schoolwork, and the worst part is that I don't think she's gonna give up on dad. I want out but I can't because mom will expect me to stay, whether she separates with dad or not. It hurts me to see my siblings like this and every time I try to defend or protect them, she ignores me. My family life is destroying me. Seeing my mom and siblings like this is destroying me. I want out.

This was the first time he’d ever hit me, although he was probably emotionally and verbally abusive. A difference I see between my situation and many others is he immediately wanted to get divorced and for me and my daughter to move away, which now makes sense because he wanted to control the narrative and how many people found out about it. He told me he didn’t love me and didn’t want me, so on top of the assault I felt complete rejection. I’m glad on some level, because I didn’t have the option to stay and put up with more abuse, but it still hurts and makes me feel alone as a survivor. 
We lived in a town of 1000 people, I was a hairstylist for many of the people there and very active in the community. We were both from a different city where we knew even more mutual people. We have about 130 mutual friends on Facebook and many more in the small town. After I was able to get what I needed from him in our separation agreement and move to my mother’s, I posted a carefully written statement about my experience on social media. I also personally told many people in our community of friends, and my many clients who wanted to know where I was and when they could get a haircut. I had a huge response, people writing support and telling their own stories. It was really incredible. But the dust has settled and there are many people who never said a word, or acknowledged what happened. They continue to support him, or they say nothing at all. 
Our group of friends is one I would have considered violence-intolerant. They post about me too and believing women, they are liberal and outspoken. But when I went public a lot of them stayed silent. Now they’re posting about police brutality, specifically George Floyd. I watched the video of what happened to him and was triggered into a panic attack, remembering what it was like to not be able to breathe. I’m just as angry about what is happening to black people in America, and I never want to compare my experience, but isn’t it comparable? Isn’t women being abused by men as prevalent as people of color being abused by law enforcement? And I mean this on a very personal level, not just a global one. Why are these people posting constantly about the injustice of what happened to George Floyd, and staying silent about what happened to me? 
I’m so angry and I don’t have anywhere to put it. I posted two things to my IG story yesterday pretty much saying what I’ve said here, but regretted it and took them down. I need support in this and my poor friends are so fatigued, I feel horrible for them. They empathize but can’t relate to what it’s like to be beaten and strangled, kicked out of your home with your child in a pandemic, and to speak out about it and be ignored. I know I’m focusing on the people ignoring me rather than the supportive ones, but it’s like a knife in my heart. This liberal “woke” group of people will speak up for someone they don’t know, but when their voice will actually have an impact they’re silent. And he’ll get away with this and never be held accountable by anyone and I’m sitting here with this horrible pain.

Yo shut the fuck up you troll! If you are really in trouble find a damn shelter. Don’t blame strangers for your mistakes. At least protect your son! If you’re with your abuser then that is your fault no one else’s! Walk to the damn gas station and get gas. You dumb bitch!""

ANOTHER PERFECT RESPONSE

""You know what lady, short of someone giving you cash, there is nothing to help your immediate situation. I’m guessing you conveniently ran out of gas far from resources.
Probably time to start waking to the nearest gas station with your kid and dog, and ask there if someone can help you. Sitting on your device arguing with people is a waste of time. Considering you have no gas, wonder what will happen when you have no access to internet? Batteries don’t last forever""

I'm posting those since the mods aren't doing shit. Trying to defend myself and everything gets locked. Rules only apply to certain people. Y'all do me a favor when the next mother/kid is killed by the abuser don't ask or say ""why didn't she just leave"". The abuser has already alienated the victim from friends and family and made sure there is no resources available to leave. There are cities being burned to the ground humanity is nonexistent and nobody is equal.",domesticviolence,How to assist a victim?,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/gtq15z/how_to_assist_a_victim/,True
563,Dickfitswell1138,t2_1ozsyt4o,1590895091,gtrna2,6,/r/domesticviolence/comments/gtrna2/caught_girlfriend_cheating_in_chat_she_pulled_a/,1,"I was dating my now 43 year old ex-girlfriend for 5+ years. We've had serious issues here and there, I've been thrown out and left a bunch of times. She's cheated on me on Tinder 6+ times. She was always trashing me to her friends on social media. One of her friends egged her on to keep cheating on me. She almost left me for someone else once. Her adult son went crazy one morning, and threatened me with a knife, and stabbed our kitchen table.

Our issues stemmed from a bunch of different sources: her son (20) was a drug addict and a drug dealer who didn't clean up after himself. Her oldest daughter (23) was a drug addict that was also a cutter and was bulimic. Her younger daughter(18) was also a drug addict and later became a drug dealer. She had one son who was a good student in school who had no real issues. (19).

She was former Army going through a divorce with a somewhat indifferent husband who had moved on with a younger woman. I had been divorced 2 years, and was living alone, when she was involuntarily separated from the Army for high year tenure, and was about to lose her housing.

We had known each other in high school, but not well. We hung out a few times. In fact, I asked her to marry me when I was 18 and she was 16, but she said ""no"".

We began talking on Facebook Messenger, and she would go into another room and talk to me, for hours and hours. We got along great. Eventually she surprised me and came down to see me, December 26, 2014, and stayed for a while, until things got crazy back home. She bought me a car, as I had lost mine in some wrangling with my ex-wife during my divorce, an old.Buick, but hey, it was a car, and I loved her for helping me.

She left again in February,  but we reunited on Valentine's day for a Hozier concert in Seattle, which she arranged and paid for. She had gotten severance pay from the Army. She lived off this for a good while, and didn't work for around 3 months or more. 

It was a good time, and I loved her, but even then, I knew I couldn't please her. She had a huge sex drive, and I had suffered a bit from erectile dysfunction. I had some pills, but they were old, but I had underlying problems with my blood pressure and blood sugar that were causing problems.

Eventually, she moved back in with me, and we had a great life, just laughing and talking and spending time together. Her oldest daughter was living on her own in D.C., her youngest daughter and oldest son was living with her dad in San Antonio, and her younger son, the food student, came to live with us, and she brought her 3 dogs, 2 golden retrievers and a small terrier mix.

Eventually, things got bad at the exhusbands place, so the you get daughter and oldest son came to live with us in a small, 700ft 1 bedroom apartment. 

Eventually, we had to move. The daughter kept skipping school and getting the property management to let her in where they could see the 3 large dogs, so we were asked to leave, also based on occupancy. We had 5 people in there.

When we moved to the new neighborhood, my girlfriend asked her oldest daughter if she wanted to live with us, and she brought her Russian live-in boyfriend, and broke up with him on the same day, but he continued to live with us for a year. My girlfriend at this time was a nurse, so she make good money. I wasn't making very much, and I felt like such a mooch. I had paid all the bills at our old apartment, as I had when I lived alone, but I had little left over after child support was taken out. I helped where I could, I always did the dishes, the laundry, cleaning the whole house, vacuuming...I tried to make her life easier in ways that I could, since I couldn't help in financial ways. I loved her deeply, but I always felt a bit outnumbered and outvoted, and had no real say in anything.

A year or so later, I lost my job, and was unemployed for a year. I took great care of the house, but she despised my not working. She was paying for everything related to the house, and I was taking care of it, but I really wasn't that big of a burden, I was cleaning up after 4 kids that weren't mine, and one live in boyfriend, occasionally taking them to school when they missed the bus, or I would drive them to work. At some point, her oldest son began bringing drug addicts and derelicts around the house, and I had words with him about it. My girlfriend hated me disciplining her kids, but she wasn't doing it, either. She let them run all over her, cursing her out, calling her names, disrespecting her...something I put a stop to. You'd think she'd appreciate that, but she felt it was causing a problem in her relationship with her kids.

She began going on Tinder and hooking up with random guys for quickies. Once, she even let one guy watch once. She began seeing a guy named Jim, leaving me alone with her kids while she went to have sex with him. She would lie and say she was going to fo look at a table for sale or go to a thrift shop.

Things got real bad for a while, when the oldest daughter threw her boyfriend out, and turned to alcohol. She would get driven home by the bartender so they could go home. She would dump hundreds of dollars out on the ground and leave her cellphone, and new iPhone, in the street.

Her oldest son had gotten thrown out of two schools, and was now on his 3rd time as a senior. He and his friends stole a wallet from a truck at a nearby construction site, which brought the police to our home. They drew guns on me, demanding I turn him over. He wasn't even home. Our house became the bad house in the neighborhood where the cops were always called.

My girlfriend helped me find another job, and let me drive her truck, while she sold her car to her son so he could go to his academy school for special students across town. She was a nurse for the same company I worked for, though in different cities. We could communicate on Skype to one another all day. It was beautiful. I still didn't make enough ro support her, but I would come home, and clean, and do car repairs, and build projects for her. Anything she asked for.

Eventually, the youngest daughter became a problem, with drugs and alcohol and skipping school, and one got her boyfriend to try and run me over with his car,...and she moved back with her father. She moved back 6 months later, with a new drug habit, and was even worse. She was climbing in and out of windows, lying about working, and staying gone days at a time. The oldest daughter had herself committed, met a friend inside, tried to convince us the friend should move in, and got a job as a waitress in a strip club.  The oldest son kept bringing trashy friends over in the middle of the night, making our house smell like pot, and sneaking his younger sister out for parties. The oldest sister gave her alcohol and she almost killed herself with alcohol poisoning, and the police came, having been called because she had been drinking on Facebook Live.

The oldest son came home high, and shit in the backyard. My girlfriend confronted him, and he started acting like he was going to hit her. I shouted from upstairs, and he came up the steps at me with a knife. My girlfriend called the police, and he was arrested. She bailed him out, which caused a fight. We worked through that, she got him his own place, the youngest daughter found some drug counselor to live with, and my girlfriend had a fight with the oldest daughter when she came home drunk again, and the oldest daughter moved out, too, leaving just the good student son, who then found a friend to move out with, leaving just the two of us again.

My girlfriend had quit her job, and went back to college to be a doctor. It was hard and stressful. The truck died, and I had built up enough credit to buy a new car. My girlfriend bought two more cars, whixh i fixed up for her, was in accidents in both, and got one more last car.

Things were okay. She had too much time on her hands, and began starting fights when I came home because she wanted to do something and I was just trying to relax. I still couldn't match her libido. 

Eventually I come home, and she tells me she has started talking to a cousin she hadn't spoken to in 10 years. I don't think much of it at first, but she's going into closed rooms to talk to him. I catch a few screens of their chats online, and they're really suggestive for cousins. I mentioned it, and she said there was nothing to worry about.

She had been repairing her credit. She wanted to buy a house. Waived in an HOA, and the rent was terrible. She got her VA home loan, and we were preparing to move. We had found this house she loved because it was on a lot of land for her plants and dogs, and it had a handicap accessible bathroom off of the master bedroom, which she said she selected for me, because I have bad knees. It wasn't one floor, like we had talked about, but it was nice. It was older, and the wiring was crazy, and there were lots of things that needed to be done. It was a good project house, and I would be kept busy.

We're in the midst of moving and packing, and she's hiding in other rooms, talking to this ""cousin"". I eventually open the door, and ask just what is going on. This was similar to the way I was talking to her when she was about to move on from her ex-husband, so my suspicion was going off. 

For the scene I started, she broke up with me, and I was told it was over, that she didn't want me to move with her, al.ost like it was planned that way. She had a meeting with her kids, and had a chat with her friend that was always pushing her to leave me, that she was either going to not buy the house and just move in with her cousin, or buy the house and all the kids could move back in because apparently I was the problem, and now I was out of the picture. 

Her kids expressed interest, especially the older waitress daughter and the drug addict son. They hadn't had particularly successful stints living on their own.

I made one last ditch effort to save the relationship, and she relented. I was back in. She made the announcement to the kids, and the oldest waitress daughter flat out said it was a mistake, according to the relationship advice she read on Tumblr. 

We moved. Some days the kids would help. Most days they didn't. I unloaded 2 Uhaul trucks by myself. I was trying to do all the things my girlfriend always wanted me to do. I took my Viagra, even though it used to make me feel bad, and we started having sex 3 to 4 times a day. We were making bold plans for this new house. Her drug addict son moved in. The waitress daughter, too. I tried to make peace. They made their plans when I wasn't going to be here.

We were doing really great, except she was still talking to this cousin an awful lot, even talking calls when we were eating together or having a conversation. 

She had made some plans to visit this cousin and the rest of her family, supposedly. She wasn't forthcoming with the date, but apparently it was a plan put in motion in the brief period we were broken up.

About two weeks before the visit, she starts to go cold. She doesn't want sex anymore, because I had satisfied that craving. She didn't want to kiss me if I was too sweaty. She was pushing me away, and talking to him more. Evey time I said something about it, she said I was being insecure. 

Last Saturday, I ask when she was leaving. She said June 3rd. She said she didn't know when she was coming back. That was how it was when she came to stay with me, too. I said something about it. I asked if she was going to unblock me on Facebook (she had blocked me when we broke up), so I could chat with her all the time when she was with him, like he was foing when she was with me, or if I was her dirty little secret.

She got up and left for an hour. Then she suggested we unpack some boxes in the bedroom together. She starts saying she never goes out, never gets to wear these pretty dresses. I don't take her anywhere nice. She leaves again for four hours this time. She comes back and tells me not to bother unpacking my things. ""There's no trust, no respect, and you hate my kids"".

I was floored. It wasn't even an argument. It was if her mind was made up by someone else. She was dead cold, and wanted nothing to do with me. I began packing my things back up again.

I try to make peace. Nothing. I try to ask her daughter what I should do, and I notice her daughter is saying the same things her mother said. I had accused her of a crime, of incest, and that was insulting. 

It gets to a point where I'm ready to leave, apparently for good. My ex-girlfriend says she was going to offer for me to stay until I found a place, if i fixed up her house with all the things i had planned to while she was gone, and maybe she would miss me, and maybe we could talk when she got back, whenever that was. Her oldest daughter was hiing to move out in a month, her oldest son was going to move in with his dad in two months, she needed someone to watch her dogs.

I agreed. At least it was a small glimmer of hope, and I had a place to stay, and didn't have to drastically alter my life. I was still heartbroken she was going to leave with our relationship in shambles.

There were little hints she still cared. She cracked jokes with me. I collect Transformers and she still went down the aisle and would tell me what they had. She had watched on our Ring cam and saw me throw away a McDonald's bag, so she knew I was eating, despite being heartbroken. 

I had made about of changes last time we broke up. I was making more now. I changed my debit pin to her birthday, like she always wanted. I made my Facebook profile pic a pic of us together. I was going to a therapist. I was looking into getting my disability pay increased. I was in line for a transfer and a promotion. I had found a program that would pay me to take care of her for her disability, that would make up in the money she was losing from college. She was using the GI Bill, but Covid was keeping her home in a virtual class, and that gave her extra time, and she spent that extra time talking to her cousin. I had told her I had some paperwork to fill out, and I had an interview the next day, and they money would be enough to cover the mortgage or my half of the combined bills. Finally, I was going to be able to contribute in a meaningful way. I had given her sex, and she still canned me. Now I was about to give her a large amount of money. 

I came home, and she was mowing the grass. She was looking very sexy, wearing this black top I always thought looked good. I told her I needed to talk to her, she said she'd come inside when she was finished. I thought for sure shed be happy, and consider taking me back. When we had talked earlier about all they ways I helped her, it almost seemed like she had gone soft again, and realised I really did love and care for her, and showed it in the best ways I could. 

I went upstairs and saw her laptop was open. I moved the mouse, it was on Facebook. I looked at the chat. There it was.

A lurid sex chat with her cousin. She was talking about it gushing like Hoover dam, and about how she couldn't wait to be with him. There were nudes exchanged. A video chat. He said she went three deep. She said it tasted great. It was perverse. It was dirty. It was very much like the sex we had the month before.

Her daughter had told me there was nobody else and I was an asshole for accusing her of a crime, something my girlfriend echoed later, letting me know the daughter had planted the seeds of the breakup. She had even said she wanted all of her mother's attention and felt she couldn't get that when we were doing well together, but here it was: she was chatting with someone else, and that someone else was her cousin, and it was incest. 

I wasn't crazy. I knew it all along. She just kept me for the move. She just kept me for the labor. Now she was going to go fuck her cousin after breaking up with me so she could justify and legitimize it and say it wasn't cheating because we weren't together. 

I called her into the kitchen and confronted her with what I saw. She immediately grew irate. She demanded I delete it from my phone. I refused. She said ""You're going to ruin me! Destroy me!""

She went into the bedroom. I took this chance to leave. When she came out of the bedroom, she had her gun in her hand. I went into the garage. She locked and loaded the gun behind me. It was a Walther PPX. There was no safety. That gun was ready to fire.

She shoved my back, forcing me into the dryer. I shoved her away, and went for the door...I went out and through the gate and felt the gun in my back. I spun around to get by her and close to my car. She stopped me, and kicked at my bad knee twice, then thrust her knees toward my knee or groin. She grabbed at the pocket for my phone. I dodged all her attacks, and was holding the gun back with one hand. She kept saying my name. I asked what she was afraid of. She shoved the barrel of the gun into my chest, I felt the barrel was right at my heart. There was anger and evil in her eyes. I heard her say my name through pursed lips and clenched teeth. I heard her finger on the trigger.

We were now at the end of the driveway. I had always told her, she or her son was one day going to kill me, and to save jail time, say it was suicide. It would be believable. I've been depressed since our breakup, and everyone knew that.

I couldn't get to my car. It was too far to go anywhere by foot to be out of range. I had accepted it: I was about to die.

Then i saw a young woman on the sidewalk across the street, and shouted out ""Please hell.me, she's going to kill me, she has a gun! Please call 911!"" and the young woman did, and reported what she saw.

The police came, and arrested my ex-girlfriend for aggravated assault with weapon, and battery, and I left alone, heartbroken, and confused.",domesticviolence,"Caught girlfriend cheating in chat, she pulled a gun",https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/gtrna2/caught_girlfriend_cheating_in_chat_she_pulled_a/,True

I went to hangout with Chad. Just to have a good time, hang out.
Little did I know I was walking into the story of my own attempted murder.
Everything was going great. We were having a great time. For the first week anyway.
He kept trying to get me to message his ex. He thought I knew where she was at. He thought I had his phone tapped and that I was working for the feds, and was trying to set him up. I couldn't give him any answers either and that started pissing him off. My last week with him was pure hell.. torture. Literally.
It started one morning, he'd been up all night. Picked me up by my throat, started choking me. Hit me a few good times. Then while I was down started pressing his knee into my chest. Told me he'd just keep doing that until I stopped breathing. That it would look like I had a heart attack. No one would know any different.
He wouldn't let me leave at this point. Threatened my family. Took my phone. Even started messaging my friends and everyone. That night he was supposed to go see his mom at the hospital and made me go.
Going down Route 2 he continued hitting me. So I opened my door and tried to jump out but he grabbed my hair and pulled me back in. I kicked and fought but he was stronger than me. That's when he took me down by the river. Saying everything would be fine and he'd let me live if I would just tell him the truth and answer his questions.
But I didn't have his answers. So I was beat some more. He was going to kill me and throw me in the river.
Then he said that would be too easy. No, he was gonna keep me alive and torture me until I gave him answers.
So we went back to his house.
Monday, March 9, 2020 is the day he slipped. One small mistake.
He took me to St. Mary's in Huntington, WV with him so he could visit his mom. Told me to wait in the truck.
Soon as he turned the corner and was out of sight I took off. Ran to the emergency room while I had 911 on the phone telling them what was going on.
I'm safe for the time being. But I'm terrified.. if he finds me, I'm dead.

I’m not sure how to start this but I’ll give a bit of background. Basically I’m a male and I met my ex in my final year of uni and I think I was swept away by the fact that she was smart, wealthy, etc etc and couldn’t believe that she actually wanted to be with me. She was great with my friends at first and when I graduated and wanted to stay in the city, I was happy to take up her offer of living with her until I found my own place and the following year we would move closer to my hometown where she would study for her masters degree. This is where it all changed...

(Sorry guys, on reread this is quite long so feel free to just skip to the last paragraph if you want to see my question)

Over the next two years she became increasingly violent and aggressive. She would dig her nails into my arm and punched me in the head on several occasions. Once, I put my arm up in self defence and it caused a bruise on her wrist which she would constantly use against me to make me feel like a bad person. My friends who she liked at first became “bad influences” and just the mention of them would flare up arguments so eventually it became easier not to see/mention them to avoid this. She changed the plan to move near to my hometown without telling me by enrolling for her masters at the same uni. Near the end of the relationship my mental health was struggling, especially following the death of my grandad and I wanted to seek counselling which she wouldn’t allow me to because I’d be a “weirdo”. I finally found the strength to leave her when she said she was going for dinner with friends and by chance I spotted her having a romantic meal with another guy.

I have too many instances of abuse and those are just some that I can pull from the top of my mind and I know that they’re not half as bad as what some have experienced on this thread. I’ve since moved back to my hometown and my friends have welcomed me back with open arms which I don’t deserve. I’ve also met the girl of my dreams who is the most intelligent person I’ve ever met, so understanding, supportive and exactly what I’ve always wanted in a partner. We own a house together and are due to be married next year.

The point I’m trying to make is that I often find myself feeling bitter towards my ex and all of those years that she has taken from me. I often think about the fact that she is free to do what she wants and that some poor guy is probably being abused by her right now and that could be down to me. I’m not sure that there’s much I can do now and I’ve tried to help friends who seem to show signs of being in controlling relationships but it never seems to scratch the itch. I also want to stop feeling like my friends secretly hate me for abandoning them. I thought that this would subside over the years but I find myself here after 5 years just as bitter as ever and wondering what I can do to move forward.",domesticviolence,5 years on and the abuse from my ex still affects me?,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/gtvalb/5_years_on_and_the_abuse_from_my_ex_still_affects/,True

Since the lockdown, victims of domestic violence have become even more vulnerable. Have you ever considered what abuse does to a child’s soul? What it is like to survive years of abuse, and process the trauma to become able to live a balanced adult life?
While Hungarian politicians keep humiliating women in public, Hungary has recently said no to the Istanbul Convention, which protects women and children from abuse. The real reason behind this decision is not that the country is completely prepared to help victims and prevent violent acts, nor is it the foreign policy (migration) arguments the government proposes, but their total indifference to the problem.
However, this is a problem that knows no country borders and appears everywhere. Come with us on May 31st, children’s day – let’s stand up for those who need protection the most!

He's schizophrenic but also violent and would assume my other brother Tony or my dad would be hooking up with his wife.  

One of my other brother's Tony was outside throwing some trash away at night and my brother Luis started shouting at him saying that my brother fucked his wife, even though Tony has a girlfriend. They ended up fighting and Tony had bloody cuts on him from the fight. They stopped once my dad pulled them apart.

The day after my brother ended up chocking his wife and almost killing her. He left bruises on her arm. She said she would call the cops and he ended up running away into the street.

He came back later threatening us if we called the cops and saying his wife was reading our minds. I ended up kicking him because he was getting close to me.

The police came by because someone called. I ran to them and told them my brother had abused and almost killed his wife. They talked to me and asked me what had been going on. My brother's wife denied the abuse and the bruise, but I told them that it was in fact caused by my brother. They took him away, although my brother did try fighting the police at some point.

They have 3 kids who have witnessed the violence going on, who will be telling the court what they witnessed. 

My brother is in jail for a bit before they do the court stuff but I'm really scared as he now is out to get me. 
I'm glad I told the police because my mom and my brother's wife kept denying the abuse.

I just hope he goes to jail forever. 
He's on parole and has 2 strikes already, so hopefully if he's charged with domestic abuse I don't have to fear him coming to kill me.

This has been so stressful and even though I wasn't being abused, I know how violent my brother is and how mad he was when my mom told him that the police talked to me.

I am very confused right now. My bf (26) of two years threw a clothes horse at me (23) two weeks ago.

 I have met this guy at my university in a very depressing time of my life. I grew up with my grandparents, my parents left me alone as a child, my dad abandoning me two times for two years. My grandpa had just passed away. I started going to therapy, which I am still doing and it helped me a lot, but he also helped me and was there for me, then I needed to cry and was very caring and empathetic. In fact he helped me heel a lot.

I really fell in love with him and wanted to become the best version of my self, kind and mindfull and empathetic. I was ready to work on every issue we had, learn to communicate better, meet his needs and be there for him...

So here is the thing, he always gets very upset and angry over small things. He starts crying then he has to do something in the household, so I end up doing it. I think he is a workaholic. He works up to ten hours every single day... In our two years of relationship he took like three weeks off. He says he feels empty and depressed then he is not working. He can't fight. Every time we have an argument, he rather leaves the room or stares at his phone. Two times he had punched a wall in front of me, blaming me for it. ""I push his buttons"". Then he started throwing stuff against the wall. He won't talk to me until I apologize for the argument (It is normally just me pointing out small things, that hurt or bother me). 

This time it was about my grandmothers birthday. I wanted to visit her and for him to come along. He struggled a said, that he would rather work. I got really sad and told him that it makes me said he doesn't care and he had an outburst and threw the clothes horse at me. I raised my arm and it left a scratch. Then he went silend and I packed my things and went away.

He then wrote a really long letter apologizing and we agreed to talk again a few weeks from then, after cooling down. And I don't know what to do. If I should try to work things out, find another way to solve our problems or just leave it and suffer a bit. I know that no relationship is perfect and that everthing needs work...

So here is the thing. I kind of know he can be very kind and creative and playfull and he really helped me. I don't want to hurt him and a part of me is excusing all this I guess. Like he is very stressed, works very hard, his mom has a depression and his parents really are always fighting, even getting violent... And I really have compassion for him and don't want things to end. On the other hand... It is not only this. He is so disrespectfull with my creative work, insulted my believes... One time he wanted me to write a two page essay, explaining why my policial opinion on a topic is wrong (It wasn't just the same as his). 

He cares a lot about what people think and gets upset then I am joking around with my friends and having fun, like just dancing around with my best friend Eva. He sais that this embarases him. 

Don't know... Could it all just get worse? Am I co-depended? Don't know... A part of me believes it is all my fault, that I am being to harsh, then expressing my concerns... I can get very sad sometimes, too and just lie in bed a cry. I also get angry, then he insults me... But I never try to harm him on purpose and I am trying to grow as a person and communicate better every time... Also noting that my dad is a narcissist and he wrecked my judgedment of people and situations...

How can I help her?

Background -
We used to work together but have gone on to work for different companies. I have seen bruises and various cuts on her face, she said the abuse started with a ""playful"" dead arm or dead leg when arguing, then gradually got worse to a slap and then punches and kicks and even household items being used. 

This lady has 3 young children, one of the main reasons why she wont tell the police is the fear of her children being taken away from her.

I want to help, I don't know how to help.
What can I do? Are there any resources I could give to her to help?

I don’t even know where to start. I just feel like I shouldn’t be as bothered by this as I am. I’ve been raped three times in my life, as well as sex trafficked. I feel if I call rape again, people are going to just stop believing me, I’M going to stop believing me. I feel there’s only so many times you can say you were raped before people stop believing you.

To give a little bit of backstory, I have a very turbulent relationship with my parents. Last month, I (19 female) got into a huge argument with them, and my boyfriend (23, male, let’s call him Ryan) picked me up to stay with him in his basement apartment a few cities over.

I wouldn’t say my relationship with Ryan is the greatest. He is totally uncommunicative and it’s like pulling teeth trying to get him to explain his emotions towards me. He never cleans up after himself, always makes me do household chores (his laundry, his dishes, his cleaning of his room and stuff, in addition to my own chores).

I am also in school full time online (and have been for a couple weeks now) and haven’t even opened any of my courses because I’ve been so busy. 
I also have no money coming in and have to apply for Ontario Works (social assistance).
In addition to that, my grandpa was just released from the hospital on palliative care with cancer and has very little time left, but I can’t see him because I’m sick (my doctor though it was covid but it’s actually a kidney infection that could lead to kidney failure. I’m on antibiotics right now).

Ryan and I broke up about a week ago after I (very difficultly) pulled out of him that he doesn’t enjoy spending time with me and would rather spend time alone. He sleeps till 4pm, wakes up, wants alone time from me so he goes for a walk, we have dinner while he looks at cars on his phone or watches tv, then he plays video games while I clean up after him. I fall asleep around 12pm and he stays up till 4am because he “needs a bit more alone time” (his words). 

So once Ryan and I broke up last week, he decided he wanted to go back home to his town a few cities over to see his mom and his dog. He was leaving Tuesday and said I can stay till Friday at the latest in his apartment. So I was scrambling to find an apartment quickly, get on Ontario Works, try to work on school work, send email updates to my grandpa, communicate with my therapist, and clean the apartment, all with a very painful kidney infection. 

Fast forward to last night, Ryan and I decide to have some edibles because I’m in a lot of kidney pain and very stressed out. 

To give some backstory on this, I don’t do well with weed. I suffer from something called cannabis-induced psychosis (it doesn’t happen every time though). The first time I ever had marijuana, it was shatter and I severely greened out, because I had waaaay too much. I was also sexually assaulted when I greened out. I think that, along with the fact that all of my sexual assaults have involved marijuana, just fucked up my tolerance. 

I took half a caramel edible last night. One caramel was 5 mg thc/cbd balance. I split it in half so that it was only 2.5mg. That’s not a lot at all, that’s a minuscule amount. Still, less than an hour later, I was forgetting every couple of seconds where I was, absolutely mind blown that there was a wall I could lean on behind me, felt like I could feel every molecule in the sheets I was sitting on, and amazed that I could coordinate my body to get a spoonful of ice cream from my cup to my mouth. I can’t believe how high I was on so little thc and cbd. It felt like I had the whole package. 

At some point, I remember becoming so freaked out by the fact that my body could move from sitting up to lying down. I’d be lying beside Ryan and then I’d sit up, become so freaked out, and then 3 seconds later, totally forget how I got from lying down to sitting up. I remember lying face-up on my back on the bed, leaning my head against the wall, and slowly slipping into a comatose-like state.

Ryan would poke me and tickle my feet, but I wouldn’t respond to any of it. If he tried tickling me, my brain would feel it, and my body too, but I couldn’t move to react to it. I could make small movements with my hands, but they were balled up into fists and my leg muscles felt so tight. I was squeezing all my muscles and when I would actively try to relax them, they would spasm and twitch and go back to being tight. 

I was staring at the ceiling. At some point, I remember my eyes rolling into the back of my head, and then closing my eyes and becoming aware of the fact that I was breathing, and controlling my breathing. I thought that if I stopped thinking about breathing, it wouldn’t happen naturally and I’d just suffocate. 

Ryan laid down beside me and asked if I was okay. He roughly pulled my eye open with his fingers and I couldn’t see anything. It felt like my eyes were in the back of my skull. All I could do at that point was move my mouth by smiling, even if I was freaking out in my head. My outside body and smile didn’t match the inside of my body and my mind. 

Even though I could hear everything going on and feel everything at the point, I couldn’t react to it or move or speak. I felt Ryan pushing my body around. Everything was weak. My arms felt heavy and my whole body was limp. He started grabbing me and I remember him saying “you’re just like a toy doll, I can do whatever I want to you”. I remember him taking my underwear off and fucking me. I wasn’t able to move or say anything but he was manhandling me, grabbing me hard, strangling me, and at one point he pushed me over and I forcefully hit my head against the cannot beside the bed. I still didn’t react and it didn’t hurt, but I remember feeling the pressure of the hit. 

At some point, he finished, and got up to go to the bathroom. I remember still being unable to move but freaking out in my head that I needed to call someone, anyone, to ask for help. 

When I was finally able to start moving and open my eyes, I stumbled around and slowly walked around the apartment, looking for my headphones and forgetting what I was doing every couple seconds. I couldn’t really talk or communicate, except say small sentences like “I’m going walking”. 

He gave me his pocket knife and seemed genuinely worried about me going out at 3 in the morning by myself, high. I just wanted to get away to think. 

When I called a friend, she got mad at me and told me I should’ve known I couldn’t handle weed. She said “that’s what happens when you do shit like that. Bad stuff will happen”. I felt like it was all my fault and felt guilty. So I went back home (it didn’t help that I was feeling very paranoid, like someone was following me). 

I got back home and, despite feeling like I had been gone for an hour, Ryan said I was gone maybe 10-15 minutes max. I don’t really remember the rest of the night, but I’m pretty sure we went to bed shortly after that.

The next morning, I woke up and felt so shitty about myself. I remember most of what happened, and my head was killing me from the forceful hit. When Ryan woke up, I asked him if he knew why my head was hurting so much, knowing full well he wouldn’t say anything. He couldn’t give me an answer, and said maybe it was my medications causing it. 

All day, I made casual comments about my head and my eye hurting, my arms hurting as though there were bruises developing, but nothing. He wouldn’t admit anything. It was only that night that he said with a laugh “do you remember us having sex last night?”. I said no and asked him to explain what happened, but he brushed it off and changed the subject. Fast forward a day, I wake up with swelling in my eyelid where he forced it open with his (probably dirty) fingers. Over the past couple days, the swelling has been getting worse, to the point where I can barely see out of my eye while I’m writing this.

Ryan has gone back home so I’m in the apartment by myself, with a lot of anxiety.

I thought I’d write this post basically to ask if this was wrong in any way? I know it’s a stupid question but, we were kind of still together (he’s my ex but it’s complicated. We still kiss, hug, have sex), and I just feel like there’s a reasonable explanation for why he did this. I’m pretty pissed about my eye though, especially because he won’t admit that he pried open my eye with his dirty hands day’s earlier. 

I think I’m just stunned right now that someone I trusted so much could do something like this. It makes me not want to trust anyone again :(

He appeared to be asleep but lots of his behaviours didn’t add up and eventually I just believe what he said due to not being able to prove otherwise. 

He would have sex with me and I would wake up, get him off of me and then he would do a dramatic wake up usually because getting him off of me involved me kicking him in the shin due to him being literally over twice my size. After begging him to see a doctor and him telling me he was too scared to get into trouble I believed maybe it was just a sleep thing. It continued to the point in which I would wake up and be ontop and he would say that I instigated but I can’t recall at all and wasn’t in the mood ever when I woke up?

I actually went to see my doctor because I’ve been sexually abused a lot though life and I didn’t want to do something that made me very upset. Well even my doctor asked if I was sure I was instigating it and I believed what he told me was happening?

Last night after dinner my boyfriend called me a bitch because he thought i was having an attitude towards him and i felt very offended by that, but almost immediately our friend came to visit and we didn't have time to talk about what happened or why he felt compelled to be mean to me. So at 4am when our friend left i was trying to ask him what happened and get a sincere apology from him but he kept shutting me down saying ""i'm tired"" and very minimal bland ""sorry"". I felt extremely frustrated by him because i needed to talk it out before we went to bed.

So after about 5 minutes of this i got up and he was still ignoring me when i kept pressing him about why he can't just understand how he hurt my feelings. I (vigorously) grabbed the pillows he was laying on and threw them on the ground just to make a point, and then took his covers off so he couldn't just be sleeping (as context we were both slightly drunk and i get i was being immature at this point). So he begins to laugh at me which makes me even more mad and calls me a stupid c*nt bitch, or something along those lines. At this point i'm SO fed up so i grab his laptop and say ""i'm taking your laptop and mine"". I did this because i knew he would at least have to look at me and i thought at this point he would just concede for the moment and realize i just need a solid apology in order to go to bed.

so the moment i grab his laptop he jumps out of bed and pushes me to the ground, gets on top of me and puts his hand on my neck and is choking me (not extremely hard but like my airway was definitely restricted), he slaps my face and says ""don't you ever fucking do that again or i'm gonna fucking kill you"" 

at that moment he says ""what.... what's going on... why did i say that"" and i start screaming and run out of the house because i feared for my life. thankfully i am okay and my only injury is around my hip area where he tackled me to the floor.

If anyone has advice or has been in a similar

so to sum up to events that happened me and my boyfriend have been on and off for years ... we were friends for a while, me and his family were close so i used to spend nights.. we used to mess around alot sex was amazing and i ended up pregnant with my second child. 1st born turned out wasn't his but we worked things out eventually both said  that friendships/benefits the best. 

we were careless , i ended up keeping baby and not telling him about it until 2 months before my due date. which caused hella confusion between him and his (now ex) leading him to kicked out. 

month went by we would talk here and then , he would always help me when i needed help or advice. even at my lowest point he would pick me back up. he is the most kindest , purest person you will ever meet and i was lucky to have that. waking up to him and just having  him around was the best.

but i guess that wasn't enough for me we moved in together with both kids,he stepped up to be a dad to my 1st born. we were back in a relationship again. i got caught up with texting other guys , he finds out and looses it because he loves me dearly and our family.i felt guilty i didnt need to do that.everything on my end was uncalled for. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since that day, every argument has gotten physical , from a black eye , to a swollen foot , bruises all over my face and body. i know this is all my fault i wouldnt call it domestic violence , i would call it a reaction i put this man through alot , i never understood his anger even though i would feel we would be on good terms but i would always fuck it up by doing something small like having an aditude and not commuicating things that needed to be. 

today was the last straw for it all , i have a cut on my end i bled due to an argument over nonsense like having an abortion

Im 16 and during these 16 years i have seen him treat her like an animal, My mother cant even bring up a point without being hit ,His brothers are equally educated but they live a normal sane life 
But in the other hand my father’s like a maniac,He doesn’t care if she dies one day,he will still blame it on her, back in the day he was involved in shady stuff and mother was always worried and she used to ask him about his whereabouts but he wouldn’t comply and instead it would turn into an argument.
He apparently also cheats on my mother as i hear them argue over him talking to girls secretly, he denies everything and proceeds to hit her 
as i grew up i was never happy i was always broken, i was depressed , i even thought of killing myself when i was 12-13, My mother is so oppressed in her own house its just mad,its not normal My Mother is for sure depressed but she cant seek help as she’s too scared of my father , i see my friends playing with their dads like friends but i never got close with my father as im too scared and im mentally scarred,
I dont respect him but i gotta act like i do so that i dont get beaten up but he’s good dad he does provide to the family ,he buys me stuff and i got good things But that doesn’t change the fact that he’s an abuser ,
He’s over 50 and even had a cardiac arrest once but still tries to cheat on the women who sat there in the hospital all day all night praying for him but he still doesn’t respect her enough, Yes my mother is at fault too for instigating the arguments but my father is at fault too for creating the problem first of all.
I’m from Bangladesh, and what can i possibly do to help my mother? I wanted to call the police but im too scared of the consequences, i also step into their arguments and stop him from hitting her ,but for how long can i possibly do that?

But the last time we had an argument, it wasn’t even over anything important, he grabbed me and pulled me to the floor by my hair twice, covered my mouth and nose so I couldn’t breath, I bit my lip somewhere in all this so hard it was bleeding, and then he broke through the door to a locked room when I was trying to leave the situation.

I know this isn’t good and I need to leave, I haven’t been able to sleep since this has happened because all I can think about is what do I do? I feel like I have nowhere to go. We’ve been together about 4 years and we live in a house his family owns, which he doesn’t let me forget, he says it’s his house, when we argue he screams at me to leave when he knows I’ve got nowhere to go. I pay my share of the bills and do all housework because he refuses, I buy pretty much everything for the house. There are multiple holes in the walls where he has punched them in the past, I keep trying to patch them up.

When he’s finished arguing he will go back to saying how much he loves me and how he didn’t mean anything he said. 

Just after the above happened he said if he found out I told anyone what happened he would kill me. When we weren’t arguing he said he hopes I never tell anyone because in his words ‘there’d be lynch mobs going after him’ this came up after someone on Facebook invited him to like a page that was showing support for a girl who’s boyfriend had killed her .. he didn’t like that, he tried to justify what he does and says how he isn’t abusive. He was just trying to stop me screaming, or i shouldn’t have done something. 

I’ve been thinking about leaving and how I would do it but I feel like I can’t leave and rent somewhere because I have pets that’s I don’t want to leave behind, I’d have to wait until I can get enough money together anyway. should I tell someone I trust what’s happened in case it gets worse while I find somewhere else to live? What about when I do find somewhere to live, how do I tell him? Is this something I can report or have I left it too long, it’s been just over a week?

I haven't told anyone this but I suspect I was/am in an abusive relationship. Everything was fine the first three months but I spent a lot of time with him due to me recently having a sexual trauma and his bed was the only place I felt safe. He always told me it was fine and he was happy with me being there all the time, but there were small red flags. Blaming me for ""having sex"" before him (he was a virgin and before we were official, I had told him I wasn't even though now I don't see it as me having had sex before since it was coerced). He would punch the wall and get unnecessarily angry. He's had a rough childhood (experiencing neglect and I suspect he may have witnessed abuse too) so I just thought he was justified. I stopped hanging out with my friends and going out because he would make me feel bad and ignore my calls if I went out or give me the silent treatment when I came back after a night out, and he would shame me into wearing less revealing clothes. Some of the stuff that happened early on I can't remember because I think I tend to repress the arguments and verbal abuse because they happened often. Anyways, as we got closer and our relationship got older, he stopped liking me being around all the time and said he needed space. I should have complied, but it really hurt me to see a 180 from wanting me there 24/7 to not much at all. One night he went out with his friends without me and some girl kissed him (thats the story...idk what really happened and his friends are totally fine with cheating as he made me aware). After that I had trouble trusting him, but he had exhibited trust issues even before I did because within the first day of us dating he fought with me because I wouldn't let him go through my phone. I (and I know this is not ok behavior I'm not saying it is) started going through his phone after that because I felt a loss of security in our relationship and he was no longer really paying me compliments, being affectionate, expressing interest in sex, etc. I became depressed (I also suspect I have BPD and strong abandonment issues) and I told him, but he was not really supportive of me getting help or recognizing my trauma. He always thought I had no reason to be sad as I was financially comfortable and came from what appears on the outside to be a semi-normal family whereas he has struggled. We started to argue as he no longer tried to make an effort in our relationship and stopped seeming to care about me which really upset me. I really can't remember the first time he got physical with me as we used to ""play fight"" but sometimes he was a little more aggressive than I could handle (I'm a pretty small girl for reference like 100-110 pounds) but would apologize immediately after if I was hurt. Then one time he got angry in my car about something and slapped or punched me (again I think I blocked it out because all I remember was holding my face after and being hurt but with no real visible injury). After that, when he would get aggressive with me or really verbally mean I would slap him on the back almost as hard as I could (which again I feel ashamed of). Our fights became really frequent (sometimes 2-4 a week) where he would tell me to shut up or insult me and I would cry my eyes out so much that he would put a pillow over my head or cover my mouth so his roommate didn't hear me. The most escalated incident happened 2 months ago where he came home from going out with his friends and I was upset that he didn't check in on me and cuddle with me like he promised he would when he got back and I kept calling and texting him while he was in his roommates room because I was feeling anxious and depressed so I walked over to the roommates room and he (what I feel) humiliated me telling me to go away. I then went back to his room and attempted to cut myself for the first time and when I revealed to him that I did it, he told me I was psychotic and had no reason to do so, then when I cried he covered my mouth and neck with his hands, called me a dumbass, then told me he was going to sleep and didn't want to deal with my craziness. I was upset and so I shined my flashlight on him from beside the bed and he picked me up and threw me across the bed so hard it left a bruise because I hit a doorframe where my eyebrow bone is. He did not apologize or offer help after this and when I asked him for ice he screamed at me no. I kept crying until he got me ice and then when I realized it was wrong and wanted to document what happened and seek help, he took my phone, deleted the pictures, then held my phone overnight under his pillow and would not let me have it. I never sought medical attention for that and now I have headaches every day, and even though he took me on a date and told me it was an accident the next day, I still don't forgive him. I know I've engaged in some not healthy behavior probably some from my BPD such as tracking his location, going through his phone, and asking him to hang out with me instead of his friends (ones that told him it was ok to cheat on me). Do you think we're both at fault for this? He's all I have and I'm too ashamed to tell anyone what happened because they would just tell me to leave. I'm so attached to him though and even though we've broken up multiple times and gotten back together, I can't physically get myself to leave without wanting to die. What is wrong with me. If you asked me a few years ago if I thought this would ever be my life, I'd say hell no. I guess some of this is just daddy issues. Any comfort or opinions would be appreciated. Sorry again.

I also feel confused because he goes back and forth saying he doesn't love me anymore and doesn't want to be with me, to basically saying that didn't happen or he only says ""xyz"" because he's angry? I feel like I've been gaslit a lot as he's called me crazy at least 5 times and a cry baby almost every day. I know some of my behaviors were wrong, and I'm currently in therapy trying to work through my abandonment issues. But anything I ask him to do to help me he just ""can't"". Even something as simple as texting me once a day just to say hi or that he loves me. He's a terrible communicator. I hate him and I love him and I hate that I love him and that the person who makes me feel safe also makes me feel unsafe.",domesticviolence,I would like some help or insight...

My mom and dad have been together for over twenty years. Every one of those twenty years, my mom has paid the price for seeing good in a damaged person.

My dad came from a broken family and a background of poverty. His dad died when he was a kid, and his mom remarried. Her husband left them after a few years and my dad had to support his mom and two stepbrothers by himself. Left home when he was 15 to work for them. Even after he came to Australia, he'd been sending money home, usually in thousands. This resulted in many arguments, yelling matches and physical abuse. My mom had been tolerating this because she had nowhere to go, no family in the country we live in. This happened up until last year when he promised to never lay a hand on her, and his mom died, so we thought it was over. 

It wasn't. I became the victim of his physical abuse, and mum was now being tortured emotionally. She defended me against him, and he kicked her out of her bedroom and she now has to sleep on a double bed with my other two siblings. Just last week, we went to get help, but mom doesn't want to separate. Mom's holding out, hoping we could get him to change. She reckons he's not a bad person, just doesn't have any control. She's waiting for an apology and an invite back to her own bedroom. It's been four weeks. I think dad wants an apology for her defending me.

I don't know how much more of this I can take. My sisters are innocent and their childhood is being ripped out from under their feet while I can only watch. My mom blames us three for her predicament.  She takes her bitterness out on us. She doesn't know the pain she's causing them from her statements and I'm completely torn. I already have anxiety from my own childhood and I don't want it to happen to them. I'm a good student and I can't concentrate on my schoolwork, and the worst part is that I don't think she's gonna give up on dad. I want out but I can't because mom will expect me to stay, whether she separates with dad or not. It hurts me to see my siblings like this and every time I try to defend or protect them, she ignores me. My family life is destroying me. Seeing my mom and siblings like this is destroying me.

This was the first time he’d ever hit me, although he was probably emotionally and verbally abusive. A difference I see between my situation and many others is he immediately wanted to get divorced and for me and my daughter to move away, which now makes sense because he wanted to control the narrative and how many people found out about it. He told me he didn’t love me and didn’t want me, so on top of the assault I felt complete rejection. I’m glad on some level, because I didn’t have the option to stay and put up with more abuse, but it still hurts and makes me feel alone as a survivor. 
We lived in a town of 1000 people, I was a hairstylist for many of the people there and very active in the community. We were both from a different city where we knew even more mutual people. We have about 130 mutual friends on Facebook and many more in the small town. After I was able to get what I needed from him in our separation agreement and move to my mother’s, I posted a carefully written statement about my experience on social media. I also personally told many people in our community of friends, and my many clients who wanted to know where I was and when they could get a haircut. I had a huge response, people writing support and telling their own stories. It was really incredible. But the dust has settled and there are many people who never said a word, or acknowledged what happened. They continue to support him, or they say nothing at all. 
Our group of friends is one I would have considered violence-intolerant. They post about me too and believing women, they are liberal and outspoken. But when I went public a lot of them stayed silent. Now they’re posting about police brutality, specifically George Floyd. I watched the video of what happened to him and was triggered into a panic attack, remembering what it was like to not be able to breathe. I’m just as angry about what is happening to black people in America, and I never want to compare my experience, but isn’t it comparable? Isn’t women being abused by men as prevalent as people of color being abused by law enforcement? And I mean this on a very personal level, not just a global one. Why are these people posting constantly about the injustice of what happened to George Floyd, and staying silent about what happened to me? 
I’m so angry and I don’t have anywhere to put it. I posted two things to my IG story yesterday pretty much saying what I’ve said here, but regretted it and took them down. I need support in this and my poor friends are so fatigued, I feel horrible for them. They empathize but can’t relate to what it’s like to be beaten and strangled, kicked out of your home with your child in a pandemic, and to speak out about it and be ignored. I know I’m focusing on the people ignoring me rather than the supportive ones, but it’s like a knife in my heart. This liberal “woke” group of people will speak up for someone they don’t know, but when their voice will actually have an impact they’re silent. And he’ll get away with this and never be held accountable by anyone and I’m sitting here with this horrible pain. 
I don’t know what I need from this group but I’m glad to at least have a place to share this sadness and frustration.",domesticviolence,Ignored by Social Justice Warrior “Friends”,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/gtei84/ignored_by_social_justice_warrior_friends/,True

Spouse showed up at my work trying to get in and wanting to see me. He left because I wasn't there. When he was served with VPO he took his guns and left the house.

He returned within 24 hours to get all of his stuff (no proof it was him)

She moved to the city her boyfriend lives in a few months ago and lives with him, his mother and sister. 

She told me today, and doesn’t want to let her family know because she knows they’ll call the police and she doesn’t want that. (her family and all her friends, including me live in the capital city)

She works but currently doesn’t have enough to pay a deposit, 1 month rent AND rent on top of that. She was planning on leaving months ago but didn’t expect this to happen this soon. 

She doesn’t want to come back to the capital city because she loves her current job but it worries me knowing that she’s in a city where the only person she knows well is her abuser. 

I don’t think she would want to go to a women’s shelter. What should I do? I’m SO worried about her right now, I also want her to visit a doctor since she was complaining about pain.

It got to the point where he slammed me to the ground, the wall, and on the bed. He's choked me, pressed on my eyes, kicked and punched me. I know this all sounds ridiculous and anyone in their right mind would immediately know to switch gears and not care for this person. I don't know why I find myself still caring for this person. We had so much history together and he's tried to seek therapy himself but still repeats these behaviors. There were times where he was able to remain calm and asked that he leave so he could be in a better headspace to return and have civil conversations, but all that seem to go out the window when he snaps. 

 I don't like that I still care and miss him. I've blocked all contacts because I know that's what needs to happen because it got out of hand and he still tries to call me from an unknown number. Im afraid I might cave in one day and pick up. I know I shouldn't. Also, this is very embrassing to admit, but I can't help but desire our sexual chemistry again. I know that's not a healthy love, but i don't know how to wrap my head around why I feel the way I do. With this whole covid 19 shelter in place, it's been hard to get a support group going. I've already called the national domestic abuse hotline and they've linked me to my local group, but even they've haltered meetings and so I'm looking for any support I can get so that I don't go back into making the same mistakes again, thank you for taking the time to read this.",domesticviolence,How do I get myself to stop caring for my abuser?,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/gtn4cl/how_do_i_get_myself_to_stop_caring_for_my_abuser/,True

Yo shut the fuck up you troll! If you are really in trouble find a damn shelter. Don’t blame strangers for your mistakes. At least protect your son! If you’re with your abuser then that is your fault no one else’s! Walk to the damn gas station and get gas. You dumb bitch!""

ANOTHER PERFECT RESPONSE

""You know what lady, short of someone giving you cash, there is nothing to help your immediate situation. I’m guessing you conveniently ran out of gas far from resources.
Probably time to start waking to the nearest gas station with your kid and dog, and ask there if someone can help you. Sitting on your device arguing with people is a waste of time. Considering you have no gas, wonder what will happen when you have no access to internet? Batteries don’t last forever""

I'm posting those since the mods aren't doing shit. Trying to defend myself and everything gets locked. Rules only apply to certain people. Y'all do me a favor when the next mother/kid is killed by the abuser don't ask or say ""why didn't she just leave"". The abuser has already alienated the victim from friends and family and made sure there is no resources available to leave.

Our issues stemmed from a bunch of different sources: her son (20) was a drug addict and a drug dealer who didn't clean up after himself. Her oldest daughter (23) was a drug addict that was also a cutter and was bulimic. Her younger daughter(18) was also a drug addict and later became a drug dealer. She had one son who was a good student in school who had no real issues. (19).

She was former Army going through a divorce with a somewhat indifferent husband who had moved on with a younger woman. I had been divorced 2 years, and was living alone, when she was involuntarily separated from the Army for high year tenure, and was about to lose her housing.

We had known each other in high school, but not well. We hung out a few times. In fact, I asked her to marry me when I was 18 and she was 16, but she said ""no"".

We began talking on Facebook Messenger, and she would go into another room and talk to me, for hours and hours. We got along great. Eventually she surprised me and came down to see me, December 26, 2014, and stayed for a while, until things got crazy back home. She bought me a car, as I had lost mine in some wrangling with my ex-wife during my divorce, an old.Buick, but hey, it was a car, and I loved her for helping me.

She left again in February,  but we reunited on Valentine's day for a Hozier concert in Seattle, which she arranged and paid for. She had gotten severance pay from the Army. She lived off this for a good while, and didn't work for around 3 months or more. 

It was a good time, and I loved her, but even then, I knew I couldn't please her. She had a huge sex drive, and I had suffered a bit from erectile dysfunction. I had some pills, but they were old, but I had underlying problems with my blood pressure and blood sugar that were causing problems.

Eventually, she moved back in with me, and we had a great life, just laughing and talking and spending time together. Her oldest daughter was living on her own in D.C., her youngest daughter and oldest son was living with her dad in San Antonio, and her younger son, the food student, came to live with us, and she brought her 3 dogs, 2 golden retrievers and a small terrier mix.

Eventually, things got bad at the exhusbands place, so the you get daughter and oldest son came to live with us in a small, 700ft 1 bedroom apartment. 

Eventually, we had to move. The daughter kept skipping school and getting the property management to let her in where they could see the 3 large dogs, so we were asked to leave, also based on occupancy. We had 5 people in there.

When we moved to the new neighborhood, my girlfriend asked her oldest daughter if she wanted to live with us, and she brought her Russian live-in boyfriend, and broke up with him on the same day, but he continued to live with us for a year. My girlfriend at this time was a nurse, so she make good money. I wasn't making very much, and I felt like such a mooch. I had paid all the bills at our old apartment, as I had when I lived alone, but I had little left over after child support was taken out. I helped where I could, I always did the dishes, the laundry, cleaning the whole house, vacuuming...I tried to make her life easier in ways that I could, since I couldn't help in financial ways. I loved her deeply, but I always felt a bit outnumbered and outvoted, and had no real say in anything.

A year or so later, I lost my job, and was unemployed for a year. I took great care of the house, but she despised my not working. She was paying for everything related to the house, and I was taking care of it, but I really wasn't that big of a burden, I was cleaning up after 4 kids that weren't mine, and one live in boyfriend, occasionally taking them to school when they missed the bus, or I would drive them to work. At some point, her oldest son began bringing drug addicts and derelicts around the house, and I had words with him about it. My girlfriend hated me disciplining her kids, but she wasn't doing it, either. She let them run all over her, cursing her out, calling her names, disrespecting her...something I put a stop to. You'd think she'd appreciate that, but she felt it was causing a problem in her relationship with her kids.

She began going on Tinder and hooking up with random guys for quickies. Once, she even let one guy watch once. She began seeing a guy named Jim, leaving me alone with her kids while she went to have sex with him. She would lie and say she was going to fo look at a table for sale or go to a thrift shop.

Things got real bad for a while, when the oldest daughter threw her boyfriend out, and turned to alcohol. She would get driven home by the bartender so they could go home. She would dump hundreds of dollars out on the ground and leave her cellphone, and new iPhone, in the street.

Her oldest son had gotten thrown out of two schools, and was now on his 3rd time as a senior. He and his friends stole a wallet from a truck at a nearby construction site, which brought the police to our home. They drew guns on me, demanding I turn him over. He wasn't even home. Our house became the bad house in the neighborhood where the cops were always called.

My girlfriend helped me find another job, and let me drive her truck, while she sold her car to her son so he could go to his academy school for special students across town. She was a nurse for the same company I worked for, though in different cities. We could communicate on Skype to one another all day. It was beautiful. I still didn't make enough ro support her, but I would come home, and clean, and do car repairs, and build projects for her. Anything she asked for.

Eventually, the youngest daughter became a problem, with drugs and alcohol and skipping school, and one got her boyfriend to try and run me over with his car,...and she moved back with her father. She moved back 6 months later, with a new drug habit, and was even worse. She was climbing in and out of windows, lying about working, and staying gone days at a time. The oldest daughter had herself committed, met a friend inside, tried to convince us the friend should move in, and got a job as a waitress in a strip club.  The oldest son kept bringing trashy friends over in the middle of the night, making our house smell like pot, and sneaking his younger sister out for parties. The oldest sister gave her alcohol and she almost killed herself with alcohol poisoning, and the police came, having been called because she had been drinking on Facebook Live.

The oldest son came home high, and shit in the backyard. My girlfriend confronted him, and he started acting like he was going to hit her. I shouted from upstairs, and he came up the steps at me with a knife. My girlfriend called the police, and he was arrested. She bailed him out, which caused a fight. We worked through that, she got him his own place, the youngest daughter found some drug counselor to live with, and my girlfriend had a fight with the oldest daughter when she came home drunk again, and the oldest daughter moved out, too, leaving just the good student son, who then found a friend to move out with, leaving just the two of us again.

My girlfriend had quit her job, and went back to college to be a doctor. It was hard and stressful. The truck died, and I had built up enough credit to buy a new car. My girlfriend bought two more cars, whixh i fixed up for her, was in accidents in both, and got one more last car.

Things were okay. She had too much time on her hands, and began starting fights when I came home because she wanted to do something and I was just trying to relax. I still couldn't match her libido. 

Eventually I come home, and she tells me she has started talking to a cousin she hadn't spoken to in 10 years. I don't think much of it at first, but she's going into closed rooms to talk to him. I catch a few screens of their chats online, and they're really suggestive for cousins. I mentioned it, and she said there was nothing to worry about.

She had been repairing her credit. She wanted to buy a house. Waived in an HOA, and the rent was terrible. She got her VA home loan, and we were preparing to move. We had found this house she loved because it was on a lot of land for her plants and dogs, and it had a handicap accessible bathroom off of the master bedroom, which she said she selected for me, because I have bad knees. It wasn't one floor, like we had talked about, but it was nice. It was older, and the wiring was crazy, and there were lots of things that needed to be done. It was a good project house, and I would be kept busy.

We're in the midst of moving and packing, and she's hiding in other rooms, talking to this ""cousin"". I eventually open the door, and ask just what is going on. This was similar to the way I was talking to her when she was about to move on from her ex-husband, so my suspicion was going off. 

For the scene I started, she broke up with me, and I was told it was over, that she didn't want me to move with her, al.ost like it was planned that way. She had a meeting with her kids, and had a chat with her friend that was always pushing her to leave me, that she was either going to not buy the house and just move in with her cousin, or buy the house and all the kids could move back in because apparently I was the problem, and now I was out of the picture. 

Her kids expressed interest, especially the older waitress daughter and the drug addict son. They hadn't had particularly successful stints living on their own.

I made one last ditch effort to save the relationship, and she relented. I was back in. She made the announcement to the kids, and the oldest waitress daughter flat out said it was a mistake, according to the relationship advice she read on Tumblr. 

We moved. Some days the kids would help. Most days they didn't. I unloaded 2 Uhaul trucks by myself. I was trying to do all the things my girlfriend always wanted me to do. I took my Viagra, even though it used to make me feel bad, and we started having sex 3 to 4 times a day. We were making bold plans for this new house. Her drug addict son moved in. The waitress daughter, too. I tried to make peace. They made their plans when I wasn't going to be here.

We were doing really great, except she was still talking to this cousin an awful lot, even talking calls when we were eating together or having a conversation. 

She had made some plans to visit this cousin and the rest of her family, supposedly. She wasn't forthcoming with the date, but apparently it was a plan put in motion in the brief period we were broken up.

About two weeks before the visit, she starts to go cold. She doesn't want sex anymore, because I had satisfied that craving. She didn't want to kiss me if I was too sweaty. She was pushing me away, and talking to him more. Evey time I said something about it, she said I was being insecure. 

Last Saturday, I ask when she was leaving. She said June 3rd. She said she didn't know when she was coming back. That was how it was when she came to stay with me, too. I said something about it. I asked if she was going to unblock me on Facebook (she had blocked me when we broke up), so I could chat with her all the time when she was with him, like he was foing when she was with me, or if I was her dirty little secret.

She got up and left for an hour. Then she suggested we unpack some boxes in the bedroom together. She starts saying she never goes out, never gets to wear these pretty dresses. I don't take her anywhere nice. She leaves again for four hours this time. She comes back and tells me not to bother unpacking my things. ""There's no trust, no respect, and you hate my kids"".

I was floored. It wasn't even an argument. It was if her mind was made up by someone else. She was dead cold, and wanted nothing to do with me. I began packing my things back up again.

I try to make peace. Nothing. I try to ask her daughter what I should do, and I notice her daughter is saying the same things her mother said. I had accused her of a crime, of incest, and that was insulting. 

It gets to a point where I'm ready to leave, apparently for good. My ex-girlfriend says she was going to offer for me to stay until I found a place, if i fixed up her house with all the things i had planned to while she was gone, and maybe she would miss me, and maybe we could talk when she got back, whenever that was. Her oldest daughter was hiing to move out in a month, her oldest son was going to move in with his dad in two months, she needed someone to watch her dogs.

I agreed. At least it was a small glimmer of hope, and I had a place to stay, and didn't have to drastically alter my life. I was still heartbroken she was going to leave with our relationship in shambles.

There were little hints she still cared. She cracked jokes with me. I collect Transformers and she still went down the aisle and would tell me what they had. She had watched on our Ring cam and saw me throw away a McDonald's bag, so she knew I was eating, despite being heartbroken. 

I had made about of changes last time we broke up. I was making more now. I changed my debit pin to her birthday, like she always wanted. I made my Facebook profile pic a pic of us together. I was going to a therapist. I was looking into getting my disability pay increased. I was in line for a transfer and a promotion. I had found a program that would pay me to take care of her for her disability, that would make up in the money she was losing from college. She was using the GI Bill, but Covid was keeping her home in a virtual class, and that gave her extra time, and she spent that extra time talking to her cousin. I had told her I had some paperwork to fill out, and I had an interview the next day, and they money would be enough to cover the mortgage or my half of the combined bills. Finally, I was going to be able to contribute in a meaningful way. I had given her sex, and she still canned me. Now I was about to give her a large amount of money. 

I came home, and she was mowing the grass. She was looking very sexy, wearing this black top I always thought looked good. I told her I needed to talk to her, she said she'd come inside when she was finished. I thought for sure shed be happy, and consider taking me back. When we had talked earlier about all they ways I helped her, it almost seemed like she had gone soft again, and realised I really did love and care for her, and showed it in the best ways I could. 

I went upstairs and saw her laptop was open. I moved the mouse, it was on Facebook. I looked at the chat. There it was.

A lurid sex chat with her cousin. She was talking about it gushing like Hoover dam, and about how she couldn't wait to be with him. There were nudes exchanged. A video chat. He said she went three deep. She said it tasted great. It was perverse. It was dirty. It was very much like the sex we had the month before.

Her daughter had told me there was nobody else and I was an asshole for accusing her of a crime, something my girlfriend echoed later, letting me know the daughter had planted the seeds of the breakup. She had even said she wanted all of her mother's attention and felt she couldn't get that when we were doing well together, but here it was: she was chatting with someone else, and that someone else was her cousin, and it was incest. 

I wasn't crazy. I knew it all along. She just kept me for the move. She just kept me for the labor. Now she was going to go fuck her cousin after breaking up with me so she could justify and legitimize it and say it wasn't cheating because we weren't together. 

I called her into the kitchen and confronted her with what I saw. She immediately grew irate. She demanded I delete it from my phone. I refused. She said ""You're going to ruin me! Destroy me!""

She went into the bedroom. I took this chance to leave. When she came out of the bedroom, she had her gun in her hand. I went into the garage. She locked and loaded the gun behind me. It was a Walther PPX. There was no safety. That gun was ready to fire.

She shoved my back, forcing me into the dryer. I shoved her away, and went for the door...I went out and through the gate and felt the gun in my back. I spun around to get by her and close to my car. She stopped me, and kicked at my bad knee twice, then thrust her knees toward my knee or groin. She grabbed at the pocket for my phone. I dodged all her attacks, and was holding the gun back with one hand. She kept saying my name. I asked what she was afraid of. She shoved the barrel of the gun into my chest, I felt the barrel was right at my heart. There was anger and evil in her eyes. I heard her say my name through pursed lips and clenched teeth. I heard her finger on the trigger.

We were now at the end of the driveway. I had always told her, she or her son was one day going to kill me, and to save jail time, say it was suicide. It would be believable. I've been depressed since our breakup, and everyone knew that.

I couldn't get to my car. It was too far to go anywhere by foot to be out of range. I had accepted it: I was about to die.

Then i saw a young woman on the sidewalk across the street, and shouted out ""Please hell.me, she's going to kill me, she has a gun! Please call 911!"" and the young woman did, and reported what she saw.

The police came, and arrested my ex-girlfriend for aggravated assault with weapon, and battery, and I left alone, heartbroken, and confused.",domesticviolence,"Caught girlfriend cheating in chat, she pulled a gun",https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/gtrna2/caught_girlfriend_cheating_in_chat_she_pulled_a/,True

I went to hangout with Chad. Just to have a good time, hang out.
Little did I know I was walking into the story of my own attempted murder.
Everything was going great. We were having a great time. For the first week anyway.
He kept trying to get me to message his ex. He thought I knew where she was at. He thought I had his phone tapped and that I was working for the feds, and was trying to set him up. I couldn't give him any answers either and that started pissing him off. My last week with him was pure hell.. torture. Literally.
It started one morning, he'd been up all night. Picked me up by my throat, started choking me. Hit me a few good times. Then while I was down started pressing his knee into my chest. Told me he'd just keep doing that until I stopped breathing. That it would look like I had a heart attack. No one would know any different.
He wouldn't let me leave at this point. Threatened my family. Took my phone. Even started messaging my friends and everyone. That night he was supposed to go see his mom at the hospital and made me go.
Going down Route 2 he continued hitting me. So I opened my door and tried to jump out but he grabbed my hair and pulled me back in. I kicked and fought but he was stronger than me. That's when he took me down by the river. Saying everything would be fine and he'd let me live if I would just tell him the truth and answer his questions.
But I didn't have his answers. So I was beat some more. He was going to kill me and throw me in the river.
Then he said that would be too easy. No, he was gonna keep me alive and torture me until I gave him answers.
So we went back to his house.
Monday, March 9, 2020 is the day he slipped. One small mistake.
He took me to St. Mary's in Huntington, WV with him so he could visit his mom. Told me to wait in the truck.
Soon as he turned the corner and was out of sight I took off. Ran to the emergency room while I had 911 on the phone telling them what was going on.
I'm safe for the time being. But I'm terrified.. if he finds me, I'm dead.

I’m not sure how to start this but I’ll give a bit of background. Basically I’m a male and I met my ex in my final year of uni and I think I was swept away by the fact that she was smart, wealthy, etc etc and couldn’t believe that she actually wanted to be with me. She was great with my friends at first and when I graduated and wanted to stay in the city, I was happy to take up her offer of living with her until I found my own place and the following year we would move closer to my hometown where she would study for her masters degree. This is where it all changed...

(Sorry guys, on reread this is quite long so feel free to just skip to the last paragraph if you want to see my question)

Over the next two years she became increasingly violent and aggressive. She would dig her nails into my arm and punched me in the head on several occasions. Once, I put my arm up in self defence and it caused a bruise on her wrist which she would constantly use against me to make me feel like a bad person. My friends who she liked at first became “bad influences” and just the mention of them would flare up arguments so eventually it became easier not to see/mention them to avoid this. She changed the plan to move near to my hometown without telling me by enrolling for her masters at the same uni. Near the end of the relationship my mental health was struggling, especially following the death of my grandad and I wanted to seek counselling which she wouldn’t allow me to because I’d be a “weirdo”. I finally found the strength to leave her when she said she was going for dinner with friends and by chance I spotted her having a romantic meal with another guy.

I have too many instances of abuse and those are just some that I can pull from the top of my mind and I know that they’re not half as bad as what some have experienced on this thread. I’ve since moved back to my hometown and my friends have welcomed me back with open arms which I don’t deserve. I’ve also met the girl of my dreams who is the most intelligent person I’ve ever met, so understanding, supportive and exactly what I’ve always wanted in a partner. We own a house together and are due to be married next year.

The point I’m trying to make is that I often find myself feeling bitter towards my ex and all of those years that she has taken from me. I often think about the fact that she is free to do what she wants and that some poor guy is probably being abused by her right now and that could be down to me. I’m not sure that there’s much I can do now and I’ve tried to help friends who seem to show signs of being in controlling relationships but it never seems to scratch the itch. I also want to stop feeling like my friends secretly hate me for abandoning them. I thought that this would subside over the years but I find myself here after 5 years just as bitter as ever and wondering what I can do to move forward.",domesticviolence,5 years on and the abuse from my ex still affects me?,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/gtvalb/5_years_on_and_the_abuse_from_my_ex_still_affects/,True

To make a long story short, I was abused physically/sexually/emotionally long term by my husband. There is a lot of evidence of this thanks to a therapist who was excellent at documentation and recommendations to keep me as safe as possible until I was hopefully no longer brainwashed enough to stay. However, before I ever reached this point, cops were called by a witness, and there is a huge pending trial post-stay at home order that has been continued for over a year. 

I am extremely fearful for my life. As trial approaches, my anxiety is insurmountable. I don’t want to look at him, though I’m sure I will be asked. I’ve been told by my attorneys that his (expensive) attorney is known to be brutal and preys on the abuser-victim dynamic/mentality to win their case. 

Last night I stupidly ventured into our old messages. I wanted to know if I was better, or if his words could still make me believe I deserved every beating, unforgivable comments, etc. 

When he thought I had reason to call the cops or when I said his physical violence upset me, he would later text me that I beat him. Even though I’ve never laid a hand on anyone in my life. I only ever ducked and covered, I was never able to fight back. I completely froze in every incident. 

I am terrified as he was so calculated and the jury or judge will favor him because of his attempts to cover his tracks. Despite audio evidence of him admitting to abusing me. During which, when I would remind him abuse is illegal and he could lose his military job, he would say “you beat me I don’t know what you’re talking about”. 

Will a jury understand that manipulation is part of the abuse I endured or will I be torn apart on the stand in attempt to protect myself/others from him? 

I am utterly petrified. I am on the verge of a panic attack just thinking about trial which is a considerable amount of time away. I’ve read that to a judge or jury, anxiety behaviors such as fidgeting, looking down, etc. can make you look dishonest but being in the same room with him or seeing his face could throw me into flight or fight mode and I’m afraid I will not be able to appear any more brave, put together, or sincere. 

I feel as if I “lose” no matter the outcome. I convicted, he warned me he would ruin my life, kill me, etc. if this affected his job, family, what have you. On the other hand, he is so calculated I fear no one would ever believe me no matter how many photos, videos, etc. I had. 

There is also the fact that it’s been postponed for so long, details have become fuzzy and I am afraid if my memory doesn’t serve me perfectly and consistently, my testimony will be irrelevant despite the hours of trauma I will revisit and yet again, endure. 

Anyone with advice about getting through this, or experience with bench trials, ideas for coping skills before/during the trial, etc. are extremely appreciated.",domesticviolence,Please help- trial,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/grsxzc/please_help_trial/,True

-Does it matter that the objects probably would not have hurt you?

-Why would you give your SO another chance?

-Would you tell anyone about your SO’s behavior, like their family? (Other than law enforcement).

I originally posted this in r/relationships but it was removed by moderators to avoid trolling. 

Background: I am interested in everyone’s perspective based on a recent event in my life. My girlfriend (27F) threw objects at me (28M) out of anger after I told her I did not see a future with her based on her emotionally abusive behavior (we have had this conversation before).  She missed, and they weren’t things that necessarily would have hurt me or caused significant damage. She stopped throwing things after I threatened to call the police. 

To add, the conversation preceding this revolved around her trying to convince me to move back and how I was not comfortable doing so. 

We separated earlier this year, and she has since attended therapy. She believes attending therapy for a few months should be enough for me to return to live with her, and that I have to live with her to see how she has changed. 

She has never done this before, but has had issues in the past controlling her anger. She was somewhat apologetic after the incident, but said it was both of our faults and one of us should have de-escalated the situation.  (I don’t buy it)

Frankly, prior to the incident I was not comfortable returning to live with her. Now, I’m not quite sure if I even want to *see* her again, let alone share a living space. 

And in case anyone is wondering, I have *never* thrown anything at her out of anger. Her behavior was not an act of self-defense. 

Of course, I love her and hope she gets better. That’s why this has been difficult for me.

TL;DR: Estranged girlfriend threw things at me out of anger. I didn’t get hurt (she missed), she is a little apologetic.

I tried to get by and he started shoving me. I forcibly moved him out of the way and was walking to my room when my wife hit me in the back with a glass bottle. I asked her to just let me go and let’s calm down. She grabbed me by the neck. I started to film her and she immediately let go. 

A little background: I’ve had a really bad last few years. I was laid off and unemployed. I became seriously depressed and tried antidepressant medication as well as psilocybin mushrooms. I have been quite upset and angry at moments. It was probably emotionally abusive. I have been seeing a therapist. My wife went twice but she stopped saying the problems are mine. I still go. 

I don’t know what to do. I told my wife it was not ok but she said she should have hit me harder because I deserved it and that I’m a big ninny.

&amp;#x200B;

I broke up with M at the beginning of this year and several trying years of trying to break it off and being taken seriously (6 years regretfully together). For much of the relationship, we had a dead bedroom. When I would threaten break up and talk about how I was suffering, suddenly my complaints would be addressed, but maybe just for that day or few days. We'd have sex and M would finally do the chores (or pay his long awaited month's rest -- just for that month's rent -- after on and off months of him not paying). However, other times when I tried to force a breakup, M would have a suicidal breakdown and then I would freak out. M would also ignore and tell me that we not broken up even if we discussed it. This time, however, things were different. M finally agreed to a break up and agreed to be out by March (we are both on the lease). Well, March passed, then April, and now May. They have only managed to save up $1200 within that time as they have told me that they blew it on drugs and video games (and I know other things).

They agreed to end of July, but when I brought it up today they said that they ""hoped"" to move out by then. I then suggested that they could have the apartment as it would allow for them not to have to pay many of the fees and deposits. They got incredibly upset, told me they couldn't afford them, and that my goal was to financially ruin them since they felt the apartment @ $1200/month (not including utilities) was too expensive for them (they make the same amount as me, but purchased a used luxury car, ran up credit, and have student loans). I told them that I just wanted to separate and that I had hoped that by them having the apartment, it would be easier on them. They could then pay the remaining 5 months and go elsewhere, if they'd like. During that discussion, they began giving me the silent treatment and wouldn't even look at me. After several hours, they then came back and said that they would agree to keep the apartment if they could do so at the end of July and I told M that that would defeat the purpose.

Even more hours later, they calmed down, and started acting affectionate. I have been stuck in quarantine with them for the last two months. I go out just to the store and see no one else. I have been going to Zoom meetups and trying to call friends, but am so incredibly lonely and miss the in-person connection. I finished school recently, so I have less to occupy myself with and distract me from the loneliness. I feel like, despite being broken-up and 100% wanting M to move-out, it's hard not to be friendly and affectionate. I am lonely and I just want someone I can talk to and curl up next to. It's so stupid. When I am greyrocking, they take away my personal items like my phone and computer (even made like they were going to destroy my computer), scream at me, kick things, and so on.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no place to escape to as they are able and do unlock all of the doors that I try to hide behind. It's at such a hot, unsafe temperature that it isn't safe to just take a walk outside and none of my friends live close to me. I am never given any privacy and when M starts a fight, M will continuously badger me until I scream at them or react. Then, they will smirk and tell me I am the abuser.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do.  I am tired of being screamed at, belittled, having slurs thrown at me, lied to, left to a dirty house, and without privacy. What are my best courses of action? They have said they will sue me if I try to move-out. I have been journaling the events, but I feel like this whole thing is hopeless. I hate that I still seek attention and affection, too. I feel so disgusted with myself. I also feel like M jumps between hot and cold to punish me and demonstrate that they have control in the relationship. Is this why abuser will seem really angry and/or distant one moment, super affectionate the next, and then angry/belittling?",domesticviolence,How to deal with situation where I am stuck living with abusive ex who won't leave?,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/grvv1v/how_to_deal_with_situation_where_i_am_stuck/,True

I have a few questions I was hoping you might be able to provide me!

I just want to start by saying that this is (barely) an app idea but I wanted to check if it was worth it for victims. I'll briefly explain what I've thought of so far...

Firstly I presume that there is a lot of surveillance in these situations and was wondering how far does it go. E.g. social media for example.
I thought that for safety's sake having a skin (for example a duplication of some boring app like calculator) that can be only removed with a password
- is this likely to work? Do you think that person will notice a duplication of an app they don't use often?

Secondly the app itself... I was going to try and see to make it more of a ""collection of evidence"" so when that person manages to break the cycle they have the proof, I've seen a few posts about the police's limitations/lack of interest and I thought perhaps this would help? So things I thought you could store in here
- photos (not accessible from gallery) or videos/voice recordings, maybe pdfs of any hospital visits that would record this?
- a diary of some sort, either for your own use or to note attacks/incidences
- if possible some sort of secret bank account, but I can see some limitations of this happening due to potential surveillance on bank statements. 
- resources/advice 

Any comments on what I have listed or further ideas?

I wish I had the opportunity to leave the house way before, but I couldn't live alone since I had seizures on a daily basis. Now I feel better and with a change of medication I have gone from several seizures a day to absolutely no seizures.

My parents are extremely traditional. Traditional, overprotective and maybe... abusive? I still feel guilty calling them abusive. Why? They are extremely protective and worried about my health. When I was at the hospital they were very caring. Nurses and doctors told me ""You have a very supportive and loving family, unlike most people we see on a regular basis unfortunately"".  When I was ill, my mother would come everyday even at night (even when she was not on holidays), and all I could do at the time was complaining about my health issue and crying a lot. My dad would bring me nice food almost everyday because the hospital food was not so great as you would expect. Even friends and extended family find my parents ""overprotective"" but adorable and extremely loving.

**However, I still don't understand most of their behavior :**

\- When I was younger my parents would argue everyday at night, I would hear them throwing dishes against the wall, yelling in another room, slamming doors... I was confused and scared. I was also scared for my mother, I thought that my dad would be able to kill my mother if he wanted to. Once my dad went absolutely furious because of my mother's ""manipulative and disrespectful behavior"" and he made violent threats. It was terrible for my siblings and we had to leave the house with my mother for a few hours, just in case.

I have tried several times to talk about these events to my mother years later and she told me ""he's just furious at the moment but two hours later he forgets about it"". That's true. And to be fair he is not always like that. Most of the time he's just very kind and funny. But he completely has anger issues with me and my mother. My other siblings do everything to please him so he never really has any issues with them, I was always the ""rebel"" one according to both of my parents because I have some insight about their behavior and yes I do have a ... controversial temperament, I am the only one among my siblings. Otherwise every single person I have met see me as extremely polite and not an argumentative person.

But... yesterday, many years later... he did exactly the same thing with me. I was wearing a beanie in hot weather because I didn't have time to blow dry my hair properly. I know that it's not the right time to wear a beanie but I don't think I caused him prejudice by wearing my beanie. He went completely furious, yelled in front of me and said ""Now just SHUT UP or I am going to humiliate you in front of everyone in the street and in public places"", which he almost did in front of someone before I left and cry.

I told my mother about what happened, she said I was ""oversensitive"", and that this event was ""created by my own imagination"", ""you know I have always known that you were extremely creative, even as a child"", (I must admit that I was extremely sensitive as a child but I would never lie or make false statements about events which truly happened and I don't have any history of pathological lying). Once she even said that I was ""oversensitive"" and ""giving to much importance to bad people"" when I tried to confess about things that happened to me in school, such as extreme bullying including repeated rape threats.

**Another event :**

I cannot date anyone besides the context of marriage, so when my parents learnt that I was dating someone (I was 17) and lied for the first time about seeing a female friend instead of my boyfriend they also went furious, started to beat me, bite me, pulled my hair. It was **extremely violent**. They called me names ""slut"", ""shame to the family"", ""in our family dating without marriage is FORBIDDEN every woman here knows that, you're the only one, you don't respect your own father"" They also locked me in a room, took my mobile phone and more, I couldn't even call the cops. But several years later this even was completely forgotten. I believe that the reason why they stopped being so mean with me is that they knew I would speak against them to other family members. And I have decided to forgive them for that event. I was too kind. The beanie event was way too much.

&amp;#x200B;

**Other events**

\- Trying to make me feel like a ""spoiled child"" for having food and water. I had to take extremely cold showers for years because my parents just didn't care at all about it. The only time I was ""spoiled"" (I wasn't *really* spoiled but they cared about me) was after being in the emergency room at the hospital, so it was way later.  But despite that I still think my parents worked hard for me for me and my siblings.

\- My mother was calling me names as a child

\- When my grades were not good enough, I was beaten and yelled at, **because most of the time** I had excellent grades, **except when I was ill and bullied**

\- Cannot leave the house alone or even with friends in the evening and at night, my father has to be there to drive me at the place. ""For my own safety"", ""to avoid getting raped or murdered"".

**What I want to do now**

Leave in a few months ""for my studies"" officially, because I am done living with them exactly. I might have an apartment after summer. I am not even doing therapy for two reasons.  I have a bad experience with a therapist who couldn't admit that the issue was more than ""overprotective parenting"" and I want to save money for the next few months. If they won't let me leave (I don't want to have the police involved) I will have to go on my own without them noticing the day I leave, just with a backpack. Since I won't have anyone in my family to help me with the apartment moving stuff, I am probably going to leave a lot of belongings in my parents' house. Since I might cut contact with them if things don't turn well it will probably be lost. But my safety and well-being are more important and I realize I have been in denial my whole life.

But now I feel completely lost. My entire life has been a lie : my ""parents"" are not the ""kind"" people I thought they were and I don't feel safe anymore. I want to stop confessing stuff to my mother because she makes me feel like a complete ungrateful liar, which I am not. And when I talk to other people about my parents, either they think I am overreacting because ""it's obvious that they love me despite all the bad stuff"", either they believe me but think I just have to ""disobey"", ""you're an adult after all"". Yes, an adult, but terrified of my own parents and their reactions.

Tl;dr: I feel completely ungrateful for calling my parents ""abusive"" (when they can actually be violent, for innocent things like dating or wearing a beanie in hot weather, which can be seen as a lack of respect in my parents' eyes), because they make me feel like a spoiled person for having access to decent housing and food.

612,Smil1ng1,t2_46neuktw,1590691289,gsbzrm,3,/r/domesticviolence/comments/gsbzrm/assistance_for_text_based_safety_planning_question/,1,"I am in need of assistance for safety planning via email or text. I am newly hearing impaired. I'm also a client of vocational rehabilitation and a University student.

I am in touch with my local domestic violence agency. I have not signed any contract with them yet.

Does anyone know about resources concerning text based safety planning? I contacted the deaf women's domestic violence and they seem to be regional. They also directed me to my local organization.

Does anyone know why safety planning is so difficult to do via email or text? I guess I'll start there. I understand the confidentiality issues. Has anyone ever done safety planning with a hearing-impaired survivor that has auditory processing issues due to hearing impairment, in a written form?

The reason I'm asking is that I am in urgent need of this and I am feeling like I'm bothering my local agency by asking them repeated questions. 

My therapist through the agency also told me that people don't usually fill out the forms on their own. Due to covid-19 restrictions requiring me to email the agency and not do the intake in person, I'm  concerned about sending the information about my abuser across email. Even if it is encrypted and tracked. Even if I send it through my cell phone used as a router. This is because I do not have time to check if my ex has monitored my cell phone. I have a burner phone but it is very cheap. It does not allow me to use it as a mobile hotspot. I have no way of physically getting out at the moment. Does anyone know if burner phones are still available? Can one still purchase a cell phone at Walmart/BestBuy/Target with cash? Or do contact tracing regulations cancel all of that?

Also, unfortunately due to hearing impairment I did not communicate flawlessly to my counselor or to the agency. As a result they seem to have mistakenly diagnosed me with autism. I truly love people with autism, have worked in research for 20 years, and have no discrimination against them. But I have no history of being diagnosed with such a label. I'm very concerned about this and I'm concerned about signing a contract because I'm afraid that I will be institutionalized inappropriately. I have read horror stories from Evan Stark about survivors accumulating labels and increasing their risk.
to add to my confusion, in my last session my therapist told me that the agency does not use labels, and does not write anything down, yet in my email requesting my advocate, he indicated that I had PTSD. Additionally, it was communicated in an email from the intake person that said that my therapist indicated that I had autism. All these emails were transmitted to me.

This risk of institutionalization due to mistaken incompetency is magnified for someone with a physical disability. Stating that it is the PTSD talking causing me to ask these questions does not address the confidentiality risks as well as my responsibilities to maintain confidentiality via rules. in addition I think it's relevant to mention that my abuser constantly threatens me stating that I will be institutionalized due to my disability causing me to look ""demented"" when people don't understand my hearing impairment. What tends to happen specifically is people can see that I can physically hear but I just can't understand the consonants in language anymore, especially on the phone. So phone conversations, including with my therapist, enabled me to hear 50 to 75% of what is said by the other person. In a life-threatening situation this is not constructive. I was referred to the domestic violence agency by my primary care physician and the abuse is documented in my medical records. 

I'm waiting for ear surgery and my hearing disability is well-documented. I also have captioning accommodations for my University. My abuser destroyed my captioning phone.

This well-intentioned attempt at labeling me may be because the domestic violence tactics were very severe and life-threatening, and the agency may want to protect me. But being hearing impaired running one's own business and being a full-time University student as well as holding another job does not indicate a label that could increase my risk. So I'm a little concerned and frightened and hesitant about signing any contract especially when I'm only able to communicate via the telephone that is captioned inaccurately, or via doxy me which could be a lower level of confidentiality due to the relaxation of HIPAA rules.

I don’t even know where to start. I just feel like I shouldn’t be as bothered by this as I am. I’ve been raped three times in my life, as well as sex trafficked. I feel if I call rape again, people are going to just stop believing me, I’M going to stop believing me. I feel there’s only so many times you can say you were raped before people stop believing you.

To give a little bit of backstory, I have a very turbulent relationship with my parents. Last month, I (19 female) got into a huge argument with them, and my boyfriend (23, male, let’s call him Ryan) picked me up to stay with him in his basement apartment a few cities over.

I wouldn’t say my relationship with Ryan is the greatest. He is totally uncommunicative and it’s like pulling teeth trying to get him to explain his emotions towards me. He never cleans up after himself, always makes me do household chores (his laundry, his dishes, his cleaning of his room and stuff, in addition to my own chores).

I am also in school full time online (and have been for a couple weeks now) and haven’t even opened any of my courses because I’ve been so busy. 
I also have no money coming in and have to apply for Ontario Works (social assistance).
In addition to that, my grandpa was just released from the hospital on palliative care with cancer and has very little time left, but I can’t see him because I’m sick (my doctor though it was covid but it’s actually a kidney infection that could lead to kidney failure. I’m on antibiotics right now).

Ryan and I broke up about a week ago after I (very difficultly) pulled out of him that he doesn’t enjoy spending time with me and would rather spend time alone. He sleeps till 4pm, wakes up, wants alone time from me so he goes for a walk, we have dinner while he looks at cars on his phone or watches tv, then he plays video games while I clean up after him. I fall asleep around 12pm and he stays up till 4am because he “needs a bit more alone time” (his words). 

So once Ryan and I broke up last week, he decided he wanted to go back home to his town a few cities over to see his mom and his dog. He was leaving Tuesday and said I can stay till Friday at the latest in his apartment. So I was scrambling to find an apartment quickly, get on Ontario Works, try to work on school work, send email updates to my grandpa, communicate with my therapist, and clean the apartment, all with a very painful kidney infection. 

Fast forward to last night, Ryan and I decide to have some edibles because I’m in a lot of kidney pain and very stressed out. 

To give some backstory on this, I don’t do well with weed. I suffer from something called cannabis-induced psychosis (it doesn’t happen every time though). The first time I ever had marijuana, it was shatter and I severely greened out, because I had waaaay too much. I was also sexually assaulted when I greened out. I think that, along with the fact that all of my sexual assaults have involved marijuana, just fucked up my tolerance. 

I took half a caramel edible last night. One caramel was 5 mg thc/cbd balance. I split it in half so that it was only 2.5mg. That’s not a lot at all, that’s a minuscule amount. Still, less than an hour later, I was forgetting every couple of seconds where I was, absolutely mind blown that there was a wall I could lean on behind me, felt like I could feel every molecule in the sheets I was sitting on, and amazed that I could coordinate my body to get a spoonful of ice cream from my cup to my mouth. I can’t believe how high I was on so little thc and cbd. It felt like I had the whole package. 

At some point, I remember becoming so freaked out by the fact that my body could move from sitting up to lying down. I’d be lying beside Ryan and then I’d sit up, become so freaked out, and then 3 seconds later, totally forget how I got from lying down to sitting up. I remember lying face-up on my back on the bed, leaning my head against the wall, and slowly slipping into a comatose-like state.

Ryan would poke me and tickle my feet, but I wouldn’t respond to any of it. If he tried tickling me, my brain would feel it, and my body too, but I couldn’t move to react to it. I could make small movements with my hands, but they were balled up into fists and my leg muscles felt so tight. I was squeezing all my muscles and when I would actively try to relax them, they would spasm and twitch and go back to being tight. 

I was staring at the ceiling. At some point, I remember my eyes rolling into the back of my head, and then closing my eyes and becoming aware of the fact that I was breathing, and controlling my breathing. I thought that if I stopped thinking about breathing, it wouldn’t happen naturally and I’d just suffocate. 

Ryan laid down beside me and asked if I was okay. He roughly pulled my eye open with his fingers and I couldn’t see anything. It felt like my eyes were in the back of my skull. All I could do at that point was move my mouth by smiling, even if I was freaking out in my head. My outside body and smile didn’t match the inside of my body and my mind. 

Even though I could hear everything going on and feel everything at the point, I couldn’t react to it or move or speak. I felt Ryan pushing my body around. Everything was weak. My arms felt heavy and my whole body was limp. He started grabbing me and I remember him saying “you’re just like a toy doll, I can do whatever I want to you”. I remember him taking my underwear off and fucking me. I wasn’t able to move or say anything but he was manhandling me, grabbing me hard, strangling me, and at one point he pushed me over and I forcefully hit my head against the cannot beside the bed. I still didn’t react and it didn’t hurt, but I remember feeling the pressure of the hit. 

At some point, he finished, and got up to go to the bathroom. I remember still being unable to move but freaking out in my head that I needed to call someone, anyone, to ask for help. 

When I was finally able to start moving and open my eyes, I stumbled around and slowly walked around the apartment, looking for my headphones and forgetting what I was doing every couple seconds. I couldn’t really talk or communicate, except say small sentences like “I’m going walking”. 

He gave me his pocket knife and seemed genuinely worried about me going out at 3 in the morning by myself, high. I just wanted to get away to think. 

When I called a friend, she got mad at me and told me I should’ve known I couldn’t handle weed. She said “that’s what happens when you do shit like that. Bad stuff will happen”. I felt like it was all my fault and felt guilty. So I went back home (it didn’t help that I was feeling very paranoid, like someone was following me). 

I got back home and, despite feeling like I had been gone for an hour, Ryan said I was gone maybe 10-15 minutes max. I don’t really remember the rest of the night, but I’m pretty sure we went to bed shortly after that.

The next morning, I woke up and felt so shitty about myself. I remember most of what happened, and my head was killing me from the forceful hit. When Ryan woke up, I asked him if he knew why my head was hurting so much, knowing full well he wouldn’t say anything. He couldn’t give me an answer, and said maybe it was my medications causing it. 

All day, I made casual comments about my head and my eye hurting, my arms hurting as though there were bruises developing, but nothing. He wouldn’t admit anything. It was only that night that he said with a laugh “do you remember us having sex last night?”. I said no and asked him to explain what happened, but he brushed it off and changed the subject. Fast forward a day, I wake up with swelling in my eyelid where he forced it open with his (probably dirty) fingers. Over the past couple days, the swelling has been getting worse, to the point where I can barely see out of my eye while I’m writing this.

Ryan has gone back home so I’m in the apartment by myself, with a lot of anxiety.

I thought I’d write this post basically to ask if this was wrong in any way? I know it’s a stupid question but, we were kind of still together (he’s my ex but it’s complicated. We still kiss, hug, have sex), and I just feel like there’s a reasonable explanation for why he did this. I’m pretty pissed about my eye though, especially because he won’t admit that he pried open my eye with his dirty hands day’s earlier. 

I think I’m just stunned right now that someone I trusted so much could do something like this. It makes me not want to trust anyone again :(

He appeared to be asleep but lots of his behaviours didn’t add up and eventually I just believe what he said due to not being able to prove otherwise. 

He would have sex with me and I would wake up, get him off of me and then he would do a dramatic wake up usually because getting him off of me involved me kicking him in the shin due to him being literally over twice my size. After begging him to see a doctor and him telling me he was too scared to get into trouble I believed maybe it was just a sleep thing. It continued to the point in which I would wake up and be ontop and he would say that I instigated but I can’t recall at all and wasn’t in the mood ever when I woke up?

I actually went to see my doctor because I’ve been sexually abused a lot though life and I didn’t want to do something that made me very upset. Well even my doctor asked if I was sure I was instigating it and I believed what he told me was happening?

Last night after dinner my boyfriend called me a bitch because he thought i was having an attitude towards him and i felt very offended by that, but almost immediately our friend came to visit and we didn't have time to talk about what happened or why he felt compelled to be mean to me. So at 4am when our friend left i was trying to ask him what happened and get a sincere apology from him but he kept shutting me down saying ""i'm tired"" and very minimal bland ""sorry"". I felt extremely frustrated by him because i needed to talk it out before we went to bed.

So after about 5 minutes of this i got up and he was still ignoring me when i kept pressing him about why he can't just understand how he hurt my feelings. I (vigorously) grabbed the pillows he was laying on and threw them on the ground just to make a point, and then took his covers off so he couldn't just be sleeping (as context we were both slightly drunk and i get i was being immature at this point). So he begins to laugh at me which makes me even more mad and calls me a stupid c*nt bitch, or something along those lines. At this point i'm SO fed up so i grab his laptop and say ""i'm taking your laptop and mine"". I did this because i knew he would at least have to look at me and i thought at this point he would just concede for the moment and realize i just need a solid apology in order to go to bed.

so the moment i grab his laptop he jumps out of bed and pushes me to the ground, gets on top of me and puts his hand on my neck and is choking me (not extremely hard but like my airway was definitely restricted), he slaps my face and says ""don't you ever fucking do that again or i'm gonna fucking kill you"" 

at that moment he says ""what.... what's going on... why did i say that"" and i start screaming and run out of the house because i feared for my life. thankfully i am okay and my only injury is around my hip area where he tackled me to the floor.

If anyone has advice or has been in a similar
situation please let me know, this is someone i have been completely in love with and we have plans to get married and everything.

so to sum up to events that happened me and my boyfriend have been on and off for years ... we were friends for a while, me and his family were close so i used to spend nights.. we used to mess around alot sex was amazing and i ended up pregnant with my second child. 1st born turned out wasn't his but we worked things out eventually both said  that friendships/benefits the best. 

we were careless , i ended up keeping baby and not telling him about it until 2 months before my due date. which caused hella confusion between him and his (now ex) leading him to kicked out. 

month went by we would talk here and then , he would always help me when i needed help or advice. even at my lowest point he would pick me back up. he is the most kindest , purest person you will ever meet and i was lucky to have that. waking up to him and just having  him around was the best.

but i guess that wasn't enough for me we moved in together with both kids,he stepped up to be a dad to my 1st born. we were back in a relationship again. i got caught up with texting other guys , he finds out and looses it because he loves me dearly and our family.i felt guilty i didnt need to do that.everything on my end was uncalled for. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since that day, every argument has gotten physical , from a black eye , to a swollen foot , bruises all over my face and body. i know this is all my fault i wouldnt call it domestic violence , i would call it a reaction i put this man through alot , i never understood his anger even though i would feel we would be on good terms but i would always fuck it up by doing something small like having an aditude and not commuicating things that needed to be. 

today was the last straw for it all , i have a cut on my end i bled due to an argument over nonsense like having an abortion

Im 16 and during these 16 years i have seen him treat her like an animal, My mother cant even bring up a point without being hit ,His brothers are equally educated but they live a normal sane life 
But in the other hand my father’s like a maniac,He doesn’t care if she dies one day,he will still blame it on her, back in the day he was involved in shady stuff and mother was always worried and she used to ask him about his whereabouts but he wouldn’t comply and instead it would turn into an argument.
He apparently also cheats on my mother as i hear them argue over him talking to girls secretly, he denies everything and proceeds to hit her 
as i grew up i was never happy i was always broken, i was depressed , i even thought of killing myself when i was 12-13, My mother is so oppressed in her own house its just mad,its not normal My Mother is for sure depressed but she cant seek help as she’s too scared of my father , i see my friends playing with their dads like friends but i never got close with my father as im too scared and im mentally scarred,
I dont respect him but i gotta act like i do so that i dont get beaten up but he’s good dad he does provide to the family ,he buys me stuff and i got good things But that doesn’t change the fact that he’s an abuser ,
He’s over 50 and even had a cardiac arrest once but still tries to cheat on the women who sat there in the hospital all day all night praying for him but he still doesn’t respect her enough, Yes my mother is at fault too for instigating the arguments but my father is at fault too for creating the problem first of all.
I’m from Bangladesh, and what can i possibly do to help my mother? I wanted to call the police but im too scared of the consequences, i also step into their arguments and stop him from hitting her ,but for how long can i possibly do that?

But the last time we had an argument, it wasn’t even over anything important, he grabbed me and pulled me to the floor by my hair twice, covered my mouth and nose so I couldn’t breath, I bit my lip somewhere in all this so hard it was bleeding, and then he broke through the door to a locked room when I was trying to leave the situation.

I know this isn’t good and I need to leave, I haven’t been able to sleep since this has happened because all I can think about is what do I do? I feel like I have nowhere to go. We’ve been together about 4 years and we live in a house his family owns, which he doesn’t let me forget, he says it’s his house, when we argue he screams at me to leave when he knows I’ve got nowhere to go. I pay my share of the bills and do all housework because he refuses, I buy pretty much everything for the house. There are multiple holes in the walls where he has punched them in the past, I keep trying to patch them up.

When he’s finished arguing he will go back to saying how much he loves me and how he didn’t mean anything he said. 

Just after the above happened he said if he found out I told anyone what happened he would kill me. When we weren’t arguing he said he hopes I never tell anyone because in his words ‘there’d be lynch mobs going after him’ this came up after someone on Facebook invited him to like a page that was showing support for a girl who’s boyfriend had killed her .. he didn’t like that, he tried to justify what he does and says how he isn’t abusive. He was just trying to stop me screaming, or i shouldn’t have done something. 

I’ve been thinking about leaving and how I would do it but I feel like I can’t leave and rent somewhere because I have pets that’s I don’t want to leave behind, I’d have to wait until I can get enough money together anyway. should I tell someone I trust what’s happened in case it gets worse while I find somewhere else to live? What about when I do find somewhere to live, how do I tell him? Is this something I can report or have I left it too long, it’s been just over a week?

I haven't told anyone this but I suspect I was/am in an abusive relationship. Everything was fine the first three months but I spent a lot of time with him due to me recently having a sexual trauma and his bed was the only place I felt safe. He always told me it was fine and he was happy with me being there all the time, but there were small red flags. Blaming me for ""having sex"" before him (he was a virgin and before we were official, I had told him I wasn't even though now I don't see it as me having had sex before since it was coerced). He would punch the wall and get unnecessarily angry. He's had a rough childhood (experiencing neglect and I suspect he may have witnessed abuse too) so I just thought he was justified. I stopped hanging out with my friends and going out because he would make me feel bad and ignore my calls if I went out or give me the silent treatment when I came back after a night out, and he would shame me into wearing less revealing clothes. Some of the stuff that happened early on I can't remember because I think I tend to repress the arguments and verbal abuse because they happened often. Anyways, as we got closer and our relationship got older, he stopped liking me being around all the time and said he needed space. I should have complied, but it really hurt me to see a 180 from wanting me there 24/7 to not much at all. One night he went out with his friends without me and some girl kissed him (thats the story...idk what really happened and his friends are totally fine with cheating as he made me aware). After that I had trouble trusting him, but he had exhibited trust issues even before I did because within the first day of us dating he fought with me because I wouldn't let him go through my phone. I (and I know this is not ok behavior I'm not saying it is) started going through his phone after that because I felt a loss of security in our relationship and he was no longer really paying me compliments, being affectionate, expressing interest in sex, etc. I became depressed (I also suspect I have BPD and strong abandonment issues) and I told him, but he was not really supportive of me getting help or recognizing my trauma. He always thought I had no reason to be sad as I was financially comfortable and came from what appears on the outside to be a semi-normal family whereas he has struggled. We started to argue as he no longer tried to make an effort in our relationship and stopped seeming to care about me which really upset me. I really can't remember the first time he got physical with me as we used to ""play fight"" but sometimes he was a little more aggressive than I could handle (I'm a pretty small girl for reference like 100-110 pounds) but would apologize immediately after if I was hurt. Then one time he got angry in my car about something and slapped or punched me (again I think I blocked it out because all I remember was holding my face after and being hurt but with no real visible injury). After that, when he would get aggressive with me or really verbally mean I would slap him on the back almost as hard as I could (which again I feel ashamed of). Our fights became really frequent (sometimes 2-4 a week) where he would tell me to shut up or insult me and I would cry my eyes out so much that he would put a pillow over my head or cover my mouth so his roommate didn't hear me. The most escalated incident happened 2 months ago where he came home from going out with his friends and I was upset that he didn't check in on me and cuddle with me like he promised he would when he got back and I kept calling and texting him while he was in his roommates room because I was feeling anxious and depressed so I walked over to the roommates room and he (what I feel) humiliated me telling me to go away. I then went back to his room and attempted to cut myself for the first time and when I revealed to him that I did it, he told me I was psychotic and had no reason to do so, then when I cried he covered my mouth and neck with his hands, called me a dumbass, then told me he was going to sleep and didn't want to deal with my craziness. I was upset and so I shined my flashlight on him from beside the bed and he picked me up and threw me across the bed so hard it left a bruise because I hit a doorframe where my eyebrow bone is. He did not apologize or offer help after this and when I asked him for ice he screamed at me no. I kept crying until he got me ice and then when I realized it was wrong and wanted to document what happened and seek help, he took my phone, deleted the pictures, then held my phone overnight under his pillow and would not let me have it. I never sought medical attention for that and now I have headaches every day, and even though he took me on a date and told me it was an accident the next day, I still don't forgive him. I know I've engaged in some not healthy behavior probably some from my BPD such as tracking his location, going through his phone, and asking him to hang out with me instead of his friends (ones that told him it was ok to cheat on me). Do you think we're both at fault for this? He's all I have and I'm too ashamed to tell anyone what happened because they would just tell me to leave. I'm so attached to him though and even though we've broken up multiple times and gotten back together, I can't physically get myself to leave without wanting to die. What is wrong with me. If you asked me a few years ago if I thought this would ever be my life, I'd say hell no. I guess some of this is just daddy issues. Any comfort or opinions would be appreciated. Sorry again.

I also feel confused because he goes back and forth saying he doesn't love me anymore and doesn't want to be with me, to basically saying that didn't happen or he only says ""xyz"" because he's angry? I feel like I've been gaslit a lot as he's called me crazy at least 5 times and a cry baby almost every day. I know some of my behaviors were wrong, and I'm currently in therapy trying to work through my abandonment issues. But anything I ask him to do to help me he just ""can't"". Even something as simple as texting me once a day just to say hi or that he loves me. He's a terrible communicator. I hate him and I love him and I hate that I love him and that the person who makes me feel safe also makes me feel unsafe.",domesticviolence,I would like some help or insight...

Mel got drunk and angry again. Why? my daughter decided to lift her dress up while in the house. “I will not raise her to be a whore”   
Great… I agree. It’s not great that she did that, but how she responded did not match the action.

After discipling my daughter, I consoled her. That made Mel angrier. She pulled my daughter’s hair. She got mad at me so she took it out on my daughter.   
This made me angry. I took my daughter upstairs away from Mel, and of course she followed.

Her and I clearly don’t meet eye to eye on this. We fight. She pushes my daughter because she is crying and she is mad at me. I push her and tell her never to touch her like that again.   
She got angrier. Hits me. Rips my shirt.   
I’m not defenseless. I keep pushing her back. I pull my calf muscle so I’m stuck on the bed now. She keeps punching me. I take my daughter downstairs slowly. She is hitting me and pushing me from behind. I could’ve fell while carrying my daughter. 

Downstairs she tells my daughter this is all her fault, but it somehow is also my fault. “What dadda did was wrong, but it happened because of you”. I try to stay, but she keeps kicking me while I’m just cuddling my daughter. She says she wants to stay with my daughter but doesn’t want me around. I guess I’m babying her… Also she keeps telling my daughter this is all my fault and saying that “Whatever Dad says is a lie”. This is so infuriating... Do I step down to her level? She takes my daughter back upstairs and tells me not to come up. I comply because I can’t really walk. Of course she comes back down by herself 2 minutes later. This was never about wanting to spend time with my daughter.

She leaves me alone for 20 minutes and then comes over. She tries to say this is all my fault. I tell her I don’t want to talk to her. “Right now, I find you disgusting” I tell her. After letting me know that I just ruined my daughter's life because she now thinks it’s okay for men to push women, she tells me one day she is going to stab me. She is only with me to make my life miserable… her actual words. She says I’m faking my calf injury and is insisting on taking a look at it. I tell her to not touch me. She gets mad and tries to hit me. Scratches me and bites once again. 

This is over. my daughter deserves better than her and even me. Hopefully I get custody, but that’s never going to happen. I need to pick up what I have and move on, but I don’t know how. I want to be with my daughter, but I don’t see how this can happen

My 5 siblings and I were originally living at home until the past 2 years, when everyone grew too tired of the situation at home. Most of them have cut off contact with my father and only text or call my mom once a week or every other week.

Last month my mother caught my father cheating and kicked him out of the home. He didn't really care and left. My mother is financially independent, has good health, and family support. We got her private counseling so that she would not take him back (this is not the first time he cheats and he had been yelling at her so we didn't want it to escalate).

She had been doing well until her session. I don't know what exactly the counselor said to her but she told me it was along the lines of ""everyone deserves a second chance and it's all fixable"". Lo and behold she kept visiting him at the place he's staying at, cooking for him, and buying him supplies. Two days ago he beat her up. She refused to report any of this to law enforcement. He told her after that that he wants to work things out.

Like I said I'm an adult and financially independent too. I am currently living with my mother mostly because we have space available here and I wanted to physically be here for her. I had already told her that I couldn't stand seeing her do this to herself because it's too emotionally taxing for me to stay if she does not plan to change things. At times, it feels like this whole thing hurts me more than it hurts her because she's so blase about it. I can't put her wellbeing over my own.

I'm already in the process of moving to a new job halfway across the country. But I figured a last ditch effort might be what she needs. I love her to death, but she's my parent, not my child. I can't continue on this road constantly feeling responsible for what happens to her.

Does anyone know of any counseling or therapy resources that might actually help her? At this point, I'm at a loss of how to help her. I'm sure she'll take him back home once I'm not physically here to prevent it from happening but if I could at least give her some resources before then, it could make a difference.

I'm a CPS worker and I thought I'd just post some info here regarding some things I've seen in my line of work in reference to domestic violence. I hope it doesn't come across as guilt-tripping as that's not my intention at all. I only want whoever needs it to see the other side of the story from the child's perspective. I mostly work with female victims while my male coworkers work with male victims so most of this will be regarding mother victims as it's what I have experience with.

At work, a lot of the time when talking to the victim I am told that they stay for the kids, because they feel like the children will benefit from having two parents instead of one or because they feel like a big life change (divorce) might be detrimental to the children. And so I am here to talk about specifically that.

We get a lot of calls from schools in which young kids can't concentrate in school because they're worried about their mother and whether or not she's alive because parents fought the day before and dad said he was going to kill mom.

We get other calls in which a teen ends up in jail for harming or killing his father to defend their mother. Sometimes, when kids can't intervene, they end up feeling guilty for not being able to change things, even though it's not their responsibility.

All of this takes a toll. 99% of these kids have told me they were much happier after leaving the home or would have wished the victim parent could've left.

Personally, I have taken victims for restraining orders, accompanied them to court, found them a hotel or home to stay in, and even accompanied them to change the locks on the door. This doesn't happen for every worker, but there's some good ones out there.

So no, leaving is not detrimental to them. Witnessing abuse is what is largely psychologically impacting. And on that note, they don't have to be in the same room with the victim and abuser for them to be affected. Walls are thin. Even if they were out of the home at the time of the abuse, they might get home and see marks or bruises on the victim. Or even see the victim in a bad emotional state.

Please don't use your child as a reason. It puts stress on them and when they grow up, they can feel responsible for making you stay.

To make a long story short, I was abused physically/sexually/emotionally long term by my husband. There is a lot of evidence of this thanks to a therapist who was excellent at documentation and recommendations to keep me as safe as possible until I was hopefully no longer brainwashed enough to stay. However, before I ever reached this point, cops were called by a witness, and there is a huge pending trial post-stay at home order that has been continued for over a year. 

I am extremely fearful for my life. As trial approaches, my anxiety is insurmountable. I don’t want to look at him, though I’m sure I will be asked. I’ve been told by my attorneys that his (expensive) attorney is known to be brutal and preys on the abuser-victim dynamic/mentality to win their case. 

Last night I stupidly ventured into our old messages. I wanted to know if I was better, or if his words could still make me believe I deserved every beating, unforgivable comments, etc. 

When he thought I had reason to call the cops or when I said his physical violence upset me, he would later text me that I beat him. Even though I’ve never laid a hand on anyone in my life. I only ever ducked and covered, I was never able to fight back. I completely froze in every incident. 

I am terrified as he was so calculated and the jury or judge will favor him because of his attempts to cover his tracks. Despite audio evidence of him admitting to abusing me. During which, when I would remind him abuse is illegal and he could lose his military job, he would say “you beat me I don’t know what you’re talking about”. 

Will a jury understand that manipulation is part of the abuse I endured or will I be torn apart on the stand in attempt to protect myself/others from him? 

I am utterly petrified. I am on the verge of a panic attack just thinking about trial which is a considerable amount of time away. I’ve read that to a judge or jury, anxiety behaviors such as fidgeting, looking down, etc. can make you look dishonest but being in the same room with him or seeing his face could throw me into flight or fight mode and I’m afraid I will not be able to appear any more brave, put together, or sincere. 

I feel as if I “lose” no matter the outcome. I convicted, he warned me he would ruin my life, kill me, etc. if this affected his job, family, what have you. On the other hand, he is so calculated I fear no one would ever believe me no matter how many photos, videos, etc. I had. 

There is also the fact that it’s been postponed for so long, details have become fuzzy and I am afraid if my memory doesn’t serve me perfectly and consistently, my testimony will be irrelevant despite the hours of trauma I will revisit and yet again, endure.

-Does it matter that the objects probably would not have hurt you?

-Why would you give your SO another chance?

-Would you tell anyone about your SO’s behavior, like their family? (Other than law enforcement).

I originally posted this in r/relationships but it was removed by moderators to avoid trolling. 

Background: I am interested in everyone’s perspective based on a recent event in my life. My girlfriend (27F) threw objects at me (28M) out of anger after I told her I did not see a future with her based on her emotionally abusive behavior (we have had this conversation before).  She missed, and they weren’t things that necessarily would have hurt me or caused significant damage. She stopped throwing things after I threatened to call the police. 

To add, the conversation preceding this revolved around her trying to convince me to move back and how I was not comfortable doing so. 

We separated earlier this year, and she has since attended therapy. She believes attending therapy for a few months should be enough for me to return to live with her, and that I have to live with her to see how she has changed. 

She has never done this before, but has had issues in the past controlling her anger. She was somewhat apologetic after the incident, but said it was both of our faults and one of us should have de-escalated the situation.  (I don’t buy it)

Frankly, prior to the incident I was not comfortable returning to live with her. Now, I’m not quite sure if I even want to *see* her again, let alone share a living space. 

And in case anyone is wondering, I have *never* thrown anything at her out of anger. Her behavior was not an act of self-defense. 

Of course, I love her and hope she gets better. That’s why this has been difficult for me.

&amp;#x200B;

I broke up with M at the beginning of this year and several trying years of trying to break it off and being taken seriously (6 years regretfully together). For much of the relationship, we had a dead bedroom. When I would threaten break up and talk about how I was suffering, suddenly my complaints would be addressed, but maybe just for that day or few days. We'd have sex and M would finally do the chores (or pay his long awaited month's rest -- just for that month's rent -- after on and off months of him not paying). However, other times when I tried to force a breakup, M would have a suicidal breakdown and then I would freak out. M would also ignore and tell me that we not broken up even if we discussed it. This time, however, things were different. M finally agreed to a break up and agreed to be out by March (we are both on the lease). Well, March passed, then April, and now May. They have only managed to save up $1200 within that time as they have told me that they blew it on drugs and video games (and I know other things).

They agreed to end of July, but when I brought it up today they said that they ""hoped"" to move out by then. I then suggested that they could have the apartment as it would allow for them not to have to pay many of the fees and deposits. They got incredibly upset, told me they couldn't afford them, and that my goal was to financially ruin them since they felt the apartment @ $1200/month (not including utilities) was too expensive for them (they make the same amount as me, but purchased a used luxury car, ran up credit, and have student loans). I told them that I just wanted to separate and that I had hoped that by them having the apartment, it would be easier on them. They could then pay the remaining 5 months and go elsewhere, if they'd like. During that discussion, they began giving me the silent treatment and wouldn't even look at me. After several hours, they then came back and said that they would agree to keep the apartment if they could do so at the end of July and I told M that that would defeat the purpose.

Even more hours later, they calmed down, and started acting affectionate. I have been stuck in quarantine with them for the last two months. I go out just to the store and see no one else. I have been going to Zoom meetups and trying to call friends, but am so incredibly lonely and miss the in-person connection. I finished school recently, so I have less to occupy myself with and distract me from the loneliness. I feel like, despite being broken-up and 100% wanting M to move-out, it's hard not to be friendly and affectionate. I am lonely and I just want someone I can talk to and curl up next to. It's so stupid. When I am greyrocking, they take away my personal items like my phone and computer (even made like they were going to destroy my computer), scream at me, kick things, and so on.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no place to escape to as they are able and do unlock all of the doors that I try to hide behind. It's at such a hot, unsafe temperature that it isn't safe to just take a walk outside and none of my friends live close to me. I am never given any privacy and when M starts a fight, M will continuously badger me until I scream at them or react. Then, they will smirk and tell me I am the abuser.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do.  I am tired of being screamed at, belittled, having slurs thrown at me, lied to, left to a dirty house, and without privacy. What are my best courses of action? They have said they will sue me if I try to move-out. I have been journaling the events, but I feel like this whole thing is hopeless. I hate that I still seek attention and affection, too. I feel so disgusted with myself. I also feel like M jumps between hot and cold to punish me and demonstrate that they have control in the relationship.

I have a few questions I was hoping you might be able to provide me!

I just want to start by saying that this is (barely) an app idea but I wanted to check if it was worth it for victims. I'll briefly explain what I've thought of so far...

Firstly I presume that there is a lot of surveillance in these situations and was wondering how far does it go. E.g. social media for example.
I thought that for safety's sake having a skin (for example a duplication of some boring app like calculator) that can be only removed with a password
- is this likely to work? Do you think that person will notice a duplication of an app they don't use often?

Secondly the app itself... I was going to try and see to make it more of a ""collection of evidence"" so when that person manages to break the cycle they have the proof, I've seen a few posts about the police's limitations/lack of interest and I thought perhaps this would help? So things I thought you could store in here
- photos (not accessible from gallery) or videos/voice recordings, maybe pdfs of any hospital visits that would record this?
- a diary of some sort, either for your own use or to note attacks/incidences
- if possible some sort of secret bank account, but I can see some limitations of this happening due to potential surveillance on bank statements. 
- resources/advice 

Any comments on what I have listed or further ideas?

I wish I had the opportunity to leave the house way before, but I couldn't live alone since I had seizures on a daily basis. Now I feel better and with a change of medication I have gone from several seizures a day to absolutely no seizures.

My parents are extremely traditional. Traditional, overprotective and maybe... abusive? I still feel guilty calling them abusive. Why? They are extremely protective and worried about my health. When I was at the hospital they were very caring. Nurses and doctors told me ""You have a very supportive and loving family, unlike most people we see on a regular basis unfortunately"".  When I was ill, my mother would come everyday even at night (even when she was not on holidays), and all I could do at the time was complaining about my health issue and crying a lot. My dad would bring me nice food almost everyday because the hospital food was not so great as you would expect. Even friends and extended family find my parents ""overprotective"" but adorable and extremely loving.

**However, I still don't understand most of their behavior :**

\- When I was younger my parents would argue everyday at night, I would hear them throwing dishes against the wall, yelling in another room, slamming doors... I was confused and scared. I was also scared for my mother, I thought that my dad would be able to kill my mother if he wanted to. Once my dad went absolutely furious because of my mother's ""manipulative and disrespectful behavior"" and he made violent threats. It was terrible for my siblings and we had to leave the house with my mother for a few hours, just in case.

I have tried several times to talk about these events to my mother years later and she told me ""he's just furious at the moment but two hours later he forgets about it"". That's true. And to be fair he is not always like that. Most of the time he's just very kind and funny. But he completely has anger issues with me and my mother. My other siblings do everything to please him so he never really has any issues with them, I was always the ""rebel"" one according to both of my parents because I have some insight about their behavior and yes I do have a ... controversial temperament, I am the only one among my siblings. Otherwise every single person I have met see me as extremely polite and not an argumentative person.

But... yesterday, many years later... he did exactly the same thing with me. I was wearing a beanie in hot weather because I didn't have time to blow dry my hair properly. I know that it's not the right time to wear a beanie but I don't think I caused him prejudice by wearing my beanie. He went completely furious, yelled in front of me and said ""Now just SHUT UP or I am going to humiliate you in front of everyone in the street and in public places"", which he almost did in front of someone before I left and cry.

I told my mother about what happened, she said I was ""oversensitive"", and that this event was ""created by my own imagination"", ""you know I have always known that you were extremely creative, even as a child"", (I must admit that I was extremely sensitive as a child but I would never lie or make false statements about events which truly happened and I don't have any history of pathological lying). Once she even said that I was ""oversensitive"" and ""giving to much importance to bad people"" when I tried to confess about things that happened to me in school, such as extreme bullying including repeated rape threats.

**Another event :**

I cannot date anyone besides the context of marriage, so when my parents learnt that I was dating someone (I was 17) and lied for the first time about seeing a female friend instead of my boyfriend they also went furious, started to beat me, bite me, pulled my hair. It was **extremely violent**. They called me names ""slut"", ""shame to the family"", ""in our family dating without marriage is FORBIDDEN every woman here knows that, you're the only one, you don't respect your own father"" They also locked me in a room, took my mobile phone and more, I couldn't even call the cops. But several years later this even was completely forgotten. I believe that the reason why they stopped being so mean with me is that they knew I would speak against them to other family members. And I have decided to forgive them for that event. I was too kind. The beanie event was way too much.

&amp;#x200B;

**Other events**

\- Trying to make me feel like a ""spoiled child"" for having food and water. I had to take extremely cold showers for years because my parents just didn't care at all about it. The only time I was ""spoiled"" (I wasn't *really* spoiled but they cared about me) was after being in the emergency room at the hospital, so it was way later.  But despite that I still think my parents worked hard for me for me and my siblings.

\- My mother was calling me names as a child

\- When my grades were not good enough, I was beaten and yelled at, **because most of the time** I had excellent grades, **except when I was ill and bullied**

\- Cannot leave the house alone or even with friends in the evening and at night, my father has to be there to drive me at the place. ""For my own safety"", ""to avoid getting raped or murdered"".

**What I want to do now**

Leave in a few months ""for my studies"" officially, because I am done living with them exactly. I might have an apartment after summer. I am not even doing therapy for two reasons.  I have a bad experience with a therapist who couldn't admit that the issue was more than ""overprotective parenting"" and I want to save money for the next few months. If they won't let me leave (I don't want to have the police involved) I will have to go on my own without them noticing the day I leave, just with a backpack. Since I won't have anyone in my family to help me with the apartment moving stuff, I am probably going to leave a lot of belongings in my parents' house. Since I might cut contact with them if things don't turn well it will probably be lost. But my safety and well-being are more important and I realize I have been in denial my whole life.

But now I feel completely lost. My entire life has been a lie : my ""parents"" are not the ""kind"" people I thought they were and I don't feel safe anymore. I want to stop confessing stuff to my mother because she makes me feel like a complete ungrateful liar, which I am not. And when I talk to other people about my parents, either they think I am overreacting because ""it's obvious that they love me despite all the bad stuff"", either they believe me but think I just have to ""disobey"", ""you're an adult after all"". Yes, an adult, but terrified of my own parents and their reactions.

Tl;dr: I feel completely ungrateful for calling my parents ""abusive"" (when they can actually be violent, for innocent things like dating or wearing a beanie in hot weather, which can be seen as a lack of respect in my parents' eyes), because they make me feel like a spoiled person for having access to decent housing and food. I want to leave them soon but my entire life has been a joke and I am devastated",domesticviolence,My parents act completely normal with other people and I feel ungrateful.,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/gs2y0r/my_parents_act_completely_normal_with_other/,True

Obviously will speak to a lawyer but wanted to get some input here first if anyone has any information. Anyway, my ex hit me many times and I have pictures of the 2 black eyes he gave me, but no proof of any of the other attacks. I am friends with his son’s mother who also says she was abused by him when she was with him and has given me an eerily similar description of what their relationship was like. She never pressed charges either. I recently also came into contact with another ex girlfriend of his who he used to abuse - he actually broke her ribs on the last attack. I am aware of other women he has dated and used and abused as well. He is a serial abuser and I believe he needs to be held accountable for his actions, no matter how long ago they were. I also believe he will hurt someone else and am afraid he will go too far one day. I’m wondering if anyone has any information that could help me in this situation?

My boyfriend was recently arrested for the 3rd time for assaulting me. This time he was charged with strangling me, and with child endangerment for doing so in front of our 5 year old. We've been together for 8 years. He popped my elbow out of place the first time he was arrested about 7 years ago. I had to go to the hospital that time and have my arm in asing for several weeks. The 2nd time,  3 years ago,  he punched me in the face multiple times, then grabbed our daughter and took off in the vehicle with her. We had to convince him he wouldn't be arrested to get her brought back safely. He ended up going to rehab that time for 6 months, but was relapsing soon after getting back home and it wasn't long before he was being violent again. The times he's physically abused me are too many to count. He's held me in a room with a knife to my throat threatening to kill me and screaming at me for 2 hours. He's slammed my head into the back of the ceramic toilet so hard that my vision went black and I thought I was going to die. He held a machete to my throat a few months ago and threatened to kill me again. He's choked me so hard that I couldn't breathe and hand handprints on my throat at least 5 to times. There's so much more. Typing this stuff brings up feelings of resentment, hopelessness, anger, fear, I literally have tears in my eyes thinking about it. But I'm still struggling to make the decision to leave. I have an opportunity to finally leave because he was put in jail and is now in rehab. I need to go before his 28 day rehab stay is over. But, for some reason the rehab is allowing him to call me repeatedly, at least 3 times a day; and it's really hard on me. He's not even legally supposed to be contacting me. But no one is monitoring him when he's on the phone. And I can't call and say anything to the staff. It's a really horrible situation. My daughter and I are still in his house, which his parents own. They come over here constantly. They want to make sure I'm around for him to support him in rehab and to make sure he gets his life together when he gets out. They keep telling me he deserves another chance. It's so ridiculous. It really hurts me. I've had to call his parents or go to their house many times with my daughter because of his violence. They always bring me right back here to him. One time I ran out of the house and took his vehicle and drove to their house after he had punched me so bad that my eye had swollen shut. My daughter had spent the night at their house the night before and was already there. They brought my daughter and I home to him less than 2 hours later. I have to get away from here. I know this short rehab stay won't help him. I want to do what's best for my daughter and I. I've been controlled by him, and his family, for so long and I'm scared. I'm scared to make my own decisions. I feel so unsure of myself. I just want to raise my daughter in a stable and healthy environment. I hope I'm doing the right thing. I don't think he deserves any more chances. I've been afraid he was going to kill me so many times. This is my only shot.

2. What are some of the things that your abuser has done to you?

3.  Are you male or female, how has this affected your reaction to the abuse?

4. How old are you/how old were you when you were abused?

5. What effect has the abuse had on your life? Has it left you with traumas, PTSD, anxiety, depression, night terrors etc. ? Were you able to let it go? How has it affected future relationships, or your future in general?

6. How has the abuse affected your friends and family and your relationship with them?

7. How did your abuser justify their behaviour, what were their excuses?

8. What are some traits of an abuser, how do they act? How do you recognize abusers, how did you realise you were being abused?

Mel got drunk and angry again. Why? my daughter decided to lift her dress up while in the house. “I will not raise her to be a whore”   
Great… I agree. It’s not great that she did that, but how she responded did not match the action.

After discipling my daughter, I consoled her. That made Mel angrier. She pulled my daughter’s hair. She got mad at me so she took it out on my daughter.   
This made me angry. I took my daughter upstairs away from Mel, and of course she followed.

Her and I clearly don’t meet eye to eye on this. We fight. She pushes my daughter because she is crying and she is mad at me. I push her and tell her never to touch her like that again.   
She got angrier. Hits me. Rips my shirt.   
I’m not defenseless. I keep pushing her back. I pull my calf muscle so I’m stuck on the bed now. She keeps punching me. I take my daughter downstairs slowly. She is hitting me and pushing me from behind. I could’ve fell while carrying my daughter.

I guess I’m babying her… Also she keeps telling my daughter this is all my fault and saying that “Whatever Dad says is a lie”. This is so infuriating... Do I step down to her level? She takes my daughter back upstairs and tells me not to come up. I comply because I can’t really walk. Of course she comes back down by herself 2 minutes later.

She leaves me alone for 20 minutes and then comes over. She tries to say this is all my fault. I tell her I don’t want to talk to her. “Right now, I find you disgusting” I tell her.

My 5 siblings and I were originally living at home until the past 2 years, when everyone grew too tired of the situation at home. Most of them have cut off contact with my father and only text or call my mom once a week or every other week.

Last month my mother caught my father cheating and kicked him out of the home. He didn't really care and left. My mother is financially independent, has good health, and family support. We got her private counseling so that she would not take him back (this is not the first time he cheats and he had been yelling at her so we didn't want it to escalate).

She had been doing well until her session. I don't know what exactly the counselor said to her but she told me it was along the lines of ""everyone deserves a second chance and it's all fixable"". Lo and behold she kept visiting him at the place he's staying at, cooking for him, and buying him supplies. Two days ago he beat her up. She refused to report any of this to law enforcement. He told her after that that he wants to work things out.

Like I said I'm an adult and financially independent too. I am currently living with my mother mostly because we have space available here and I wanted to physically be here for her. I had already told her that I couldn't stand seeing her do this to herself because it's too emotionally taxing for me to stay if she does not plan to change things. At times, it feels like this whole thing hurts me more than it hurts her because she's so blase about it. I can't put her wellbeing over my own.

I'm already in the process of moving to a new job halfway across the country. But I figured a last ditch effort might be what she needs. I love her to death, but she's my parent, not my child. I can't continue on this road constantly feeling responsible for what happens to her.

Does anyone know of any counseling or therapy resources that might actually help her? At this point, I'm at a loss of how to help her. I'm sure she'll take him back home once I'm not physically here to prevent it from happening but if I could at least give her some resources before then, it could make a difference. Maybe at least let me know what the final straw was for you, if it was anything you were told by a family member or friend?

I'm a CPS worker and I thought I'd just post some info here regarding some things I've seen in my line of work in reference to domestic violence. I hope it doesn't come across as guilt-tripping as that's not my intention at all. I only want whoever needs it to see the other side of the story from the child's perspective. I mostly work with female victims while my male coworkers work with male victims so most of this will be regarding mother victims as it's what I have experience with.

At work, a lot of the time when talking to the victim I am told that they stay for the kids, because they feel like the children will benefit from having two parents instead of one or because they feel like a big life change (divorce) might be detrimental to the children. And so I am here to talk about specifically that.

We get a lot of calls from schools in which young kids can't concentrate in school because they're worried about their mother and whether or not she's alive because parents fought the day before and dad said he was going to kill mom.

We get other calls in which a teen ends up in jail for harming or killing his father to defend their mother. Sometimes, when kids can't intervene, they end up feeling guilty for not being able to change things, even though it's not their responsibility.

All of this takes a toll. 99% of these kids have told me they were much happier after leaving the home or would have wished the victim parent could've left.

Personally, I have taken victims for restraining orders, accompanied them to court, found them a hotel or home to stay in, and even accompanied them to change the locks on the door. This doesn't happen for every worker, but there's some good ones out there.

So no, leaving is not detrimental to them. Witnessing abuse is what is largely psychologically impacting. And on that note, they don't have to be in the same room with the victim and abuser for them to be affected. Walls are thin. Even if they were out of the home at the time of the abuse, they might get home and see marks or bruises on the victim. Or even see the victim in a bad emotional state.

Please don't use your child as a reason. It puts stress on them and when they grow up, they can feel responsible for making you stay.

To make a long story short, I was abused physically/sexually/emotionally long term by my husband. There is a lot of evidence of this thanks to a therapist who was excellent at documentation and recommendations to keep me as safe as possible until I was hopefully no longer brainwashed enough to stay. However, before I ever reached this point, cops were called by a witness, and there is a huge pending trial post-stay at home order that has been continued for over a year. 

I am extremely fearful for my life. As trial approaches, my anxiety is insurmountable. I don’t want to look at him, though I’m sure I will be asked. I’ve been told by my attorneys that his (expensive) attorney is known to be brutal and preys on the abuser-victim dynamic/mentality to win their case. 

Last night I stupidly ventured into our old messages. I wanted to know if I was better, or if his words could still make me believe I deserved every beating, unforgivable comments, etc. 

When he thought I had reason to call the cops or when I said his physical violence upset me, he would later text me that I beat him. Even though I’ve never laid a hand on anyone in my life. I only ever ducked and covered, I was never able to fight back. I completely froze in every incident. 

I am terrified as he was so calculated and the jury or judge will favor him because of his attempts to cover his tracks. Despite audio evidence of him admitting to abusing me. During which, when I would remind him abuse is illegal and he could lose his military job, he would say “you beat me I don’t know what you’re talking about”. 

Will a jury understand that manipulation is part of the abuse I endured or will I be torn apart on the stand in attempt to protect myself/others from him? 

I am utterly petrified. I am on the verge of a panic attack just thinking about trial which is a considerable amount of time away. I’ve read that to a judge or jury, anxiety behaviors such as fidgeting, looking down, etc. can make you look dishonest but being in the same room with him or seeing his face could throw me into flight or fight mode and I’m afraid I will not be able to appear any more brave, put together, or sincere. 

I feel as if I “lose” no matter the outcome. I convicted, he warned me he would ruin my life, kill me, etc. if this affected his job, family, what have you. On the other hand, he is so calculated I fear no one would ever believe me no matter how many photos, videos, etc. I had. 

There is also the fact that it’s been postponed for so long, details have become fuzzy and I am afraid if my memory doesn’t serve me perfectly and consistently, my testimony will be irrelevant despite the hours of trauma I will revisit and yet again, endure. 

Anyone with advice about getting through this, or experience with bench trials, ideas for coping skills before/during the trial, etc. are extremely appreciated.",domesticviolence,Please help- trial,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/grsxzc/please_help_trial/,True

-Does it matter that the objects probably would not have hurt you?

-Why would you give your SO another chance?

-Would you tell anyone about your SO’s behavior, like their family? (Other than law enforcement).

I originally posted this in r/relationships but it was removed by moderators to avoid trolling. 

Background: I am interested in everyone’s perspective based on a recent event in my life. My girlfriend (27F) threw objects at me (28M) out of anger after I told her I did not see a future with her based on her emotionally abusive behavior (we have had this conversation before).  She missed, and they weren’t things that necessarily would have hurt me or caused significant damage. She stopped throwing things after I threatened to call the police. 

To add, the conversation preceding this revolved around her trying to convince me to move back and how I was not comfortable doing so. 

We separated earlier this year, and she has since attended therapy. She believes attending therapy for a few months should be enough for me to return to live with her, and that I have to live with her to see how she has changed. 

She has never done this before, but has had issues in the past controlling her anger. She was somewhat apologetic after the incident, but said it was both of our faults and one of us should have de-escalated the situation.  (I don’t buy it)

Frankly, prior to the incident I was not comfortable returning to live with her. Now, I’m not quite sure if I even want to *see* her again, let alone share a living space. 

And in case anyone is wondering, I have *never* thrown anything at her out of anger. Her behavior was not an act of self-defense. 

Of course, I love her and hope she gets better. That’s why this has been difficult for me.

We disagreed and it was getting heated so I said I wanted to leave and we could talk when people were more calm. My 17M son wouldn’t let me leave the room. I tried to get by and he started shoving me. I forcibly moved him out of the way and was walking to my room when my wife hit me in the back with a glass bottle. I asked her to just let me go and let’s calm down. She grabbed me by the neck. I started to film her and she immediately let go. 

A little background: I’ve had a really bad last few years. I was laid off and unemployed. I became seriously depressed and tried antidepressant medication as well as psilocybin mushrooms. I have been quite upset and angry at moments. It was probably emotionally abusive. I have been seeing a therapist. My wife went twice but she stopped saying the problems are mine. I still go. 

I don’t know what to do. I told my wife it was not ok but she said she should have hit me harder because I deserved it and that I’m a big ninny.

&amp;#x200B;

I broke up with M at the beginning of this year and several trying years of trying to break it off and being taken seriously (6 years regretfully together). For much of the relationship, we had a dead bedroom. When I would threaten break up and talk about how I was suffering, suddenly my complaints would be addressed, but maybe just for that day or few days. We'd have sex and M would finally do the chores (or pay his long awaited month's rest -- just for that month's rent -- after on and off months of him not paying). However, other times when I tried to force a breakup, M would have a suicidal breakdown and then I would freak out. M would also ignore and tell me that we not broken up even if we discussed it. This time, however, things were different. M finally agreed to a break up and agreed to be out by March (we are both on the lease). Well, March passed, then April, and now May. They have only managed to save up $1200 within that time as they have told me that they blew it on drugs and video games (and I know other things).

They agreed to end of July, but when I brought it up today they said that they ""hoped"" to move out by then. I then suggested that they could have the apartment as it would allow for them not to have to pay many of the fees and deposits. They got incredibly upset, told me they couldn't afford them, and that my goal was to financially ruin them since they felt the apartment @ $1200/month (not including utilities) was too expensive for them (they make the same amount as me, but purchased a used luxury car, ran up credit, and have student loans). I told them that I just wanted to separate and that I had hoped that by them having the apartment, it would be easier on them. They could then pay the remaining 5 months and go elsewhere, if they'd like. During that discussion, they began giving me the silent treatment and wouldn't even look at me. After several hours, they then came back and said that they would agree to keep the apartment if they could do so at the end of July and I told M that that would defeat the purpose.

Even more hours later, they calmed down, and started acting affectionate. I have been stuck in quarantine with them for the last two months. I go out just to the store and see no one else. I have been going to Zoom meetups and trying to call friends, but am so incredibly lonely and miss the in-person connection. I finished school recently, so I have less to occupy myself with and distract me from the loneliness. I feel like, despite being broken-up and 100% wanting M to move-out, it's hard not to be friendly and affectionate. I am lonely and I just want someone I can talk to and curl up next to. It's so stupid. When I am greyrocking, they take away my personal items like my phone and computer (even made like they were going to destroy my computer), scream at me, kick things, and so on.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no place to escape to as they are able and do unlock all of the doors that I try to hide behind. It's at such a hot, unsafe temperature that it isn't safe to just take a walk outside and none of my friends live close to me. I am never given any privacy and when M starts a fight, M will continuously badger me until I scream at them or react. Then, they will smirk and tell me I am the abuser.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do.  I am tired of being screamed at, belittled, having slurs thrown at me, lied to, left to a dirty house, and without privacy. What are my best courses of action? They have said they will sue me if I try to move-out. I have been journaling the events, but I feel like this whole thing is hopeless. I hate that I still seek attention and affection, too. I feel so disgusted with myself. I also feel like M jumps between hot and cold to punish me and demonstrate that they have control in the relationship. Is this why abuser will seem really angry and/or distant one moment, super affectionate the next, and then angry/belittling?",domesticviolence,How to deal with situation where I am stuck living with abusive ex who won't leave?,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/grvv1v/how_to_deal_with_situation_where_i_am_stuck/,True

I have a few questions I was hoping you might be able to provide me!

I just want to start by saying that this is (barely) an app idea but I wanted to check if it was worth it for victims. I'll briefly explain what I've thought of so far...

Firstly I presume that there is a lot of surveillance in these situations and was wondering how far does it go. E.g. social media for example.
I thought that for safety's sake having a skin (for example a duplication of some boring app like calculator) that can be only removed with a password
- is this likely to work? Do you think that person will notice a duplication of an app they don't use often?

Secondly the app itself... I was going to try and see to make it more of a ""collection of evidence"" so when that person manages to break the cycle they have the proof, I've seen a few posts about the police's limitations/lack of interest and I thought perhaps this would help? So things I thought you could store in here
- photos (not accessible from gallery) or videos/voice recordings, maybe pdfs of any hospital visits that would record this?
- a diary of some sort, either for your own use or to note attacks/incidences
- if possible some sort of secret bank account, but I can see some limitations of this happening due to potential surveillance on bank statements. 
- resources/advice 

Any comments on what I have listed or further ideas?

This might be a long post. I apologize in advance. 




Okay so to start let me give you the backstory of my previous relationship. I will try to be brief. I was 17 and fresh outta high school messing with a man who was 23 years older than me. Within months of meeting him i moved in with him (on my 18th birthday). He almost immediately became controlling and possessive. About a month into living with him he beat me unconscious for the first time. I tried to leave he begged me to stay, promise to never do it again, bought me expensive gifts to say sorry, and of course gave me some money. Of course I believed him and forgave him. He was sweet again for maybe a week - if that long before we got into it again. He slaps me but this time i fight back. By the time we’re done we are both bloody and bruised. “It doesn’t count as abuse if you fight back right? We just had a fight. People fight.” This is a phrase i said to myself throughout the rest of our relationship. Soon we’re physically fighting every day if not every other day. It got to the point that i no longer waited for him to hit me first whenever he got that certain look on his face i would swing first. It got to the point that all we would do is fight and fuck. I lived with him for a total of 11 months. I stayed through all the physical abuse, the verbal abuse, being beaten into a miscarriage, being locked in a room for days, and so much more. It took something extremely drastic for me to finally leave him (i wont share what cause its extremely fucked up and doesn’t pertain to this particular post. Maybe ill share my story with him more in depth another day) and when i did i was at the lowest place I’ve ever been mentally. 

Once i left the relationship i was so low i tried, unsuccessfully thankfully, to take my own life. I took that as a sign that i wasnt my time. I tried to get back to the life i had before him. I thought that would help bring me out that low place but it didnt. The same things didn’t bring me joy anymore cause i was no longer same person. The naive innocent little girl who entered that relationship died with it. I began smoking weed everyday and drinking just to cope with having to still live life. I was always the strong one emotionally so noone ever knew how i was really feeling and how i was still so close to giving up. 

Three months later i still can’t shake the feelings of hopelessness. It was like I couldn’t find where i belonged in this world anymore. I decide that it would be the night id go for it again and this time i wouldn’t fail. I decide to give my self a fun “last day” and spend majority of it just being out and about with my closest friends at that time. I had recently reconnected with an old friend (lets call him Sean and hit him up on some humbug shit. A part of me trying to prolong what i had planned.

We spend the night just smoking, talking, vibing. Before i know it its 4:00 in the morning. We end up having mind blowing sex. I didnt feel so miserable anymore, it made me rethink. Before i know if me and Sean start messing around heavy. After a month we make things exclusive. He’s shared all the issues he had going on at the time (he had been shot multiple times the year before and got arrested because the people that shot him claimed he was trying to rob them even though there was proof that it wasn’t true. So now he was fighting a case. ) i told him everything id been through in my last relationship. He helped me through having nightmares &amp;amp; panic attacks. Helped build my self confidence up. Basically he lifted me out of that darkness. 

Now here’s where the issues began, i hadn’t allowed myself to heal from my last relationship so i still reacted to things as i would have with my ex. Whenever me and Sean argued and it got really heated i got physical and always taunted him to be physical back. I constantly accused him of cheating, randomly went through his phone, etc. After we had our first son the physical stuff got worse. We would fight each other leaving scratches a small marks on each other. And the violence only got worse once i found the proof of him cheating and cheated back for get back (yes he knew. I told him the next day). Now we’re fighting multiple times a day both bruised, bloody, busted lips, you name it. Neither of us trusting the other one.

Then i end up pregnant with our youngest child. I expect the fighting to stop. I was always the one to throw the first lick in our fights so i figure just stop hitting him. Simple right? No. He no longer cared who threw the first hit. We’d grown accustomed to the fighting and he no longer had an issue hitting me first. We fought worse when i was pregnant than when i wasn’t. He’d choke me until i passed out. Id throw anything i can get my hands on at him. Me biting and scratching him. Us pulling each others hair out. 

Id turned my relationship into exactly what i had just escaped. Our most recent fight was yesterday. I dont even remember why. He choked me and scratched my neck up. Stomped me in the stomach multiple times. Hit me in the head with a bottle drawing lots of blood. Along with slamming against the wall a few times. I bit his arm until it bled. Kicked him in the nuts. Busted his lip. Scratched his arms and chest up. And threw a hair brush at him. I dont know how to get us out of this place. Both of us have horrible anger issues and will not hesitate to be physical with the other one

But when its good. Its good! Like even when we mad at each other we got each others back. He’s still my best friend. Our relationship is bipolar and i just want to remove the toxic elements and according to him. He does too. We want a better relationship and to show our kids better but have no idea where to even start 🤦🏾‍♀️",domesticviolence,I turned my current relationship into what I escaped in my previous relationship.

But I've been hit across the head a few times by him. (I know he's a POS and as soon as my safety plan us secured, I'm out, so please don't just tell me to get out. I want to and I'm going to) But in 5years time I've written off my memory problems and some other things that could be a TBI or it could be stress and PTSD! But I'm curious first off, is it even possible or likely, to get one from this kind of abuse? He's left some marks alright and he's not been gentle but like .. I've never needed medical intervention or paramedics called. The worst, (and what I wonder about having been the more harmful incident  then I initially realized is), being hit in the head while laying down already, so I didn't fall and I was on a bed. But I got very dizzy and I felt like I lost quite a few brain cells because although he walked away after that, I was talking to myself in gibberish I didn't even understand! He asked me to repeat myself one time as he heard me talking and I repeated the stupid question-that made zero sense and when he asked me WTF I was talking about I began crying again out of frustration because he didn't understand me. But at the time, even I didn't understand me and I knew I was making no sense. And I remember most of this actually all of it as far as I know. It's like the words were just falling out of my mouth and I couldn't stop them and I couldn't interject anyting sensible.

A few of these incidences have occurred in the last few years but I always end up being fine afterwards. Is it even possible that I have damaged that I don't know about? How would I bring this up to my doctor if I want to have it checked out? (Especially because I'm planning on filing charges against him when I leave for sexual assault)

We've been together for two years, and about four months ago we moved in together into a granny flat on my parents property.  They're always around, as they live in a bigger unit with my younger siblings (11F, 9M and 7M).  Before we moved, we'd occasionally get into arguments, but the worst he'd done before that was call me a cunt.  However, as we've been living together he's gotten worse.  When I bring up something that I'm upset about, he refuses to admit he's done anything wrong, it seems that suddenly it's all flipped around and I have to defend myself while he screams at me and calls me such foul things I can't repeat.  He has a bad temper when he drinks, and after an altercation with my dad he promised to not drink anymore.  He's kicked my dog in the ribs as hard as he could (she's a smaller dog).  My little sister saw my dad take him to the ground.  He's screamed in my mum's face.  He's punched walls, shoved me, locked me out of our flat and thrown my stuff around.  

It's recently got worse, as I had to buy a new phone and told him to save some money so we'd have enough for the fortnight.  He decided to still go ahead with online shopping, buying a new guitar and alcohol.  Normally, I don't care what he spends his money on, he's free to spend his money on his online shopping because I can save my money to make sure we don't go without.  I wasn't happy, but didn't say anything.  Unexpectedly, we ran out of money.  It was ok, I still had just enough smokes to get us through to payday.  However the night before when he was drinking, I noticed I had barely two smokes left.  I asked him about it, and he claimed to have no idea of what happened to it.  Before we went to bed, I gave him my last smoke and went into the bedroom irritated and upset.  When he asked what was wrong, I told him about how I asked him to save money and now we'd either have to smoke out of the ash tray or deal with nicotine withdrawals.  He said it wasn't his fault, he wanted to buy something for himself for once.  I brought up that I never buy anything for myself, I asked him not to once.  It was back and forth of him telling me I didn't need to buy a phone, and me trying to argue why I do need one.  Then, I brought up that he didn't need to buy a guitar and he said that he does *need* it.  He started calling me horrible names, and said I need to be supportive of his dreams to become a rockstar.  I told him that we live in the real world and need to survive first.    

Eventually I left to have a smoke out of the ash tray and was standing in the doorway, while he was yelling at me.  He said I drain him dry of money, ignoring that for most of the relationship I spend most of my paycheck buying him drugs.  He got pissed off I was having a smoke and demanded I get out of doorway, I told him my parents don't care where I smoke and I pay my rent.  It was like his eyes turned black.  He charged towards me and pushed me out of the room, he raised his hand and he smacked my arm hard, knocking the cigarette out of my hand and trying to slam the door in my face.  I pushed the door open and he cornered me against the door frame and hit my arm again.  I broke down crying. 

He told me to drop the crying act, that I brought it on myself by riling him up.  He called me some of the most foulest things I've heard in my life.  He said he couldn't believe he fell in love with someone like me.  Later when he calmed down he went to bed.  He promised he'd never do it again and apologised when I brought it up.  I feel shitty that I took him in when he was homeless, that I helped him out with money, helped him get a job and he does that to me.

Long story short... Husband (42 M)and I (39 F) bickered. Neither of us have ever been physically aggressive with each other before, but I grabbed his arm out of anger. He didn't talk to me for over 2 weeks and finally responded by waking me from a dead sleep to yell at me, spit in my face, tell me he wanted a divorce, choke me (super briefly), hit me in the face, punch a mirror, yell at me some more, take my ring, and then acted like I was doing something wrong for packing a bag and leaving the house. 

So, update is...the next day I waited for him to get home (with pepper spray hidden in my hand) from work and told him that we needed to talk on the weekend. Our schedules are pretty opposite so it is easy to avoid each other. There was an apology and an ""I'm a piece of shit"" but I told him I was tired and we'd talk later that weekend. Slept with a tire thumper in my bed that week in case. He was pretty much living in the basement. 

So the weekend comes. I come downstairs to talk. He just puts his arms out to hug me. I do. We lay there for a while. End up having sex several times, but never talked about anything really. The next day (yesterday), things feel good. We have a good morning together. We decide to go out for a late lunch. I am big on pictures so I take one of us. After a nice lunch we go to leave. In the car he asks to see the photo. I show him and he hits the back button and all photos come up. Well I had taken pictures of my pea sized bruise and the broken mirror. He says, ""oh what's that?"". 
Now I wanted to work things out, but that doesn't mean I was back to a point where I am comfortable that he isn't going to overreact to things. So I grabbed my phone, said they were just selfies. I took a few minutes to breathe and compose myself then tell him what they really were. Well he had obviously already figured that out. He is now pissed at me again because I tried to hide it. Says it is fucked up that I was trying to be secretive and what else am I going to be secretive about basically. 
He ended up retreating to the basement again when we got home. I was just enjoying the day after 3 weeks of hell and didn't want to spoil it. But because I took several minutes to tell the truth, apparently I'm in the wrong.

So I ran with my four children in the middle of the night to get away from my abusive husband. My friend picked us up and took us two hours and 45 mins away to her house to be safe. I have a preemie who is 7 pounds now ..a two year old...9 year old...and 12 year old. Apparently in the midst of grabbing everything from the house I forgot my wic Similac neosure for my baby and I just ran COMPLETELY out and no money to buy any and I honestly do not know what to do..I'm so scared. My friend who we moved in with is out of funds and I have no family. I called the pediatricians around here and none have any samples and hospital says they have a shortage for labor and delivery only right now. I am at a loss and so scared...anyone have any ideas because I'm out of all...oh the two local food banks here do not have ANY formula...idk I need prayers and help

I just want to give up but I know I can not do that because I am all that my four babies have. Especially now that I left and pretty much us 5 is all we have.. we have no other family and the only friend that we have is the one that is allowing us to live with her until we can get on our feet to get our own house. 

I just feel so hopeless and useless because I cannot even provide for my own children what kind of mother am I? Maybe I shouldn't have left or maybe I should go back and just deal with it for the well being of my children I do not know what to do or what to think I honestly just feel like a failure what I mean is I have failed as a mother...

I CALLED SIMILAC AND THEY ARE GOING TO SEND ME SOME FORMULA BUT IT TAKES AROUND 14 DAYS TO PROCESS THE ORDER THEN THEY SHIP IT OUT SO THE LADY ON THE PHONE SAID I CAN EXPECT IT AROUND 20 TO 30 DAYS OR A MONTH PRETTY MUCH.

They’re not stupid or ignorant, and they do the best anyone could. They’re not insecure or weak. They’re looking for the same things everyone else on this planet is.

They get therapy after the first abusive relationship and “put in the work”. They wait before going into another relationship, and know the signs. They excel and are happy in every other (non-romantic/sexual) area of their lives, usually, from career to finances to developing community and close friendships. They have strong senses of self and self-esteem.

They know the warning signs, and leave partners as soon as they begin to exhibit them. They seek and listen to anything a therapist or friend might say about a new partner’s vibe, personality, treatment.

They don’t die from the abuse, because they’re strong and smart enough to walk away.

But repeatedly, at a percentage significantly higher than the general population’s, they find themselves *having* to walk away from yet another abuser. Maybe the abuser hides all signs for the first few months, or even until a proposal or marriage. The abused woman isn’t stupid, and he fooled everyone else around her as well. She learned from her mistakes the first time. She sought others’ opinions and listened to her gut. 

Yet so many of us end up with yet another abuse story. We ultimately end up “safe”, sure, as we either leave or effectively give up and remain single.

These abusers ultimately reveal—after hiding or denying it previously—past partners they abused. I wouldn’t condone victim blaming, but I’d almost like to blame myself, as that’d give me some control here. But I can’t.

So, why is the ideal outcome of finding a loving, healthy, respectful partnership with someone we’re sexually attracted to so elusive and rare for us? Are we sexually geared to only be attracted to the pheromones of an abuser? Is that physically even possible? If it’s biological, is it possible to change this? Are we all doomed to biological infertility unless we do it all on our own? Are we just permanently damaged and destined to be single, or with an abuser? Why does this keep happening? Why does it keep happening to women who were happy on their own and with everything in their lives, aware of the signs, and so on?

And please, although I know there’s a massive selection bias here, and the stats show you’re the rarer case, if you have a success story that involves a happy, healthy marriage, please do share :)",domesticviolence,"Why do so many women who, after being abused once, end up alone or having to leave yet another abuser?",https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/gqfu74/why_do_so_many_women_who_after_being_abused_once/,True

My boyfriend was recently arrested for the 3rd time for assaulting me. This time he was charged with strangling me, and with child endangerment for doing so in front of our 5 year old. We've been together for 8 years. He popped my elbow out of place the first time he was arrested about 7 years ago. I had to go to the hospital that time and have my arm in asing for several weeks. The 2nd time,  3 years ago,  he punched me in the face multiple times, then grabbed our daughter and took off in the vehicle with her. We had to convince him he wouldn't be arrested to get her brought back safely. He ended up going to rehab that time for 6 months, but was relapsing soon after getting back home and it wasn't long before he was being violent again. The times he's physically abused me are too many to count. He's held me in a room with a knife to my throat threatening to kill me and screaming at me for 2 hours. He's slammed my head into the back of the ceramic toilet so hard that my vision went black and I thought I was going to die. He held a machete to my throat a few months ago and threatened to kill me again. He's choked me so hard that I couldn't breathe and hand handprints on my throat at least 5 to times. There's so much more. Typing this stuff brings up feelings of resentment, hopelessness, anger, fear, I literally have tears in my eyes thinking about it. But I'm still struggling to make the decision to leave. I have an opportunity to finally leave because he was put in jail and is now in rehab. I need to go before his 28 day rehab stay is over. But, for some reason the rehab is allowing him to call me repeatedly, at least 3 times a day; and it's really hard on me. He's not even legally supposed to be contacting me. But no one is monitoring him when he's on the phone. And I can't call and say anything to the staff. It's a really horrible situation. My daughter and I are still in his house, which his parents own. They come over here constantly. They want to make sure I'm around for him to support him in rehab and to make sure he gets his life together when he gets out. They keep telling me he deserves another chance. It's so ridiculous. It really hurts me. I've had to call his parents or go to their house many times with my daughter because of his violence. They always bring me right back here to him. One time I ran out of the house and took his vehicle and drove to their house after he had punched me so bad that my eye had swollen shut.

I have a project about injustice for school and my group chose the subject domestic violence. Also I'm sorry if something is unclear, English isn't my first language.

1. Who is your abuser? Is it a partner or a sibling or parent etc. ?

2. What are some of the things that your abuser has done to you?

3.  Are you male or female, how has this affected your reaction to the abuse?

4. How old are you/how old were you when you were abused?

5. What effect has the abuse had on your life? Has it left you with traumas, PTSD, anxiety, depression, night terrors etc. ? Were you able to let it go? How has it affected future relationships, or your future in general?

6. How has the abuse affected your friends and family and your relationship with them?

7. How did your abuser justify their behaviour, what were their excuses?

8. What are some traits of an abuser, how do they act? How do you recognize abusers, how did you realise you were being abused?


9. Where do you live and how does your country punish abusers?

Mel got drunk and angry again. Why? my daughter decided to lift her dress up while in the house. “I will not raise her to be a whore”   
Great… I agree. It’s not great that she did that, but how she responded did not match the action.

After discipling my daughter, I consoled her. That made Mel angrier. She pulled my daughter’s hair. She got mad at me so she took it out on my daughter.   
This made me angry. I took my daughter upstairs away from Mel, and of course she followed.

Her and I clearly don’t meet eye to eye on this. We fight. She pushes my daughter because she is crying and she is mad at me. I push her and tell her never to touch her like that again.   
She got angrier. Hits me. Rips my shirt.   
I’m not defenseless. I keep pushing her back. I pull my calf muscle so I’m stuck on the bed now. She keeps punching me. I take my daughter downstairs slowly. She is hitting me and pushing me from behind. I could’ve fell while carrying my daughter. 

Downstairs she tells my daughter this is all her fault, but it somehow is also my fault. “What dadda did was wrong, but it happened because of you”. I try to stay, but she keeps kicking me while I’m just cuddling my daughter. She says she wants to stay with my daughter but doesn’t want me around. I guess I’m babying her… Also she keeps telling my daughter this is all my fault and saying that “Whatever Dad says is a lie”. This is so infuriating... Do I step down to her level? She takes my daughter back upstairs and tells me not to come up. I comply because I can’t really walk. Of course she comes back down by herself 2 minutes later. This was never about wanting to spend time with my daughter.

She leaves me alone for 20 minutes and then comes over. She tries to say this is all my fault. I tell her I don’t want to talk to her. “Right now, I find you disgusting” I tell her. After letting me know that I just ruined my daughter's life because she now thinks it’s okay for men to push women, she tells me one day she is going to stab me. She is only with me to make my life miserable… her actual words. She says I’m faking my calf injury and is insisting on taking a look at it. I tell her to not touch me. She gets mad and tries to hit me. Scratches me and bites once again. 

This is over. my daughter deserves better than her and even me. Hopefully I get custody, but that’s never going to happen. I need to pick up what I have and move on, but I don’t know how. I want to be with my daughter, but I don’t see how this can happen

This might be a long post. I apologize in advance. 




Okay so to start let me give you the backstory of my previous relationship. I will try to be brief. I was 17 and fresh outta high school messing with a man who was 23 years older than me. Within months of meeting him i moved in with him (on my 18th birthday). He almost immediately became controlling and possessive. About a month into living with him he beat me unconscious for the first time. I tried to leave he begged me to stay, promise to never do it again, bought me expensive gifts to say sorry, and of course gave me some money. Of course I believed him and forgave him. He was sweet again for maybe a week - if that long before we got into it again. He slaps me but this time i fight back. By the time we’re done we are both bloody and bruised. “It doesn’t count as abuse if you fight back right? We just had a fight. People fight.” This is a phrase i said to myself throughout the rest of our relationship. Soon we’re physically fighting every day if not every other day. It got to the point that i no longer waited for him to hit me first whenever he got that certain look on his face i would swing first. It got to the point that all we would do is fight and fuck. I lived with him for a total of 11 months. I stayed through all the physical abuse, the verbal abuse, being beaten into a miscarriage, being locked in a room for days, and so much more. It took something extremely drastic for me to finally leave him (i wont share what cause its extremely fucked up and doesn’t pertain to this particular post. Maybe ill share my story with him more in depth another day) and when i did i was at the lowest place I’ve ever been mentally. 

Once i left the relationship i was so low i tried, unsuccessfully thankfully, to take my own life. I took that as a sign that i wasnt my time. I tried to get back to the life i had before him. I thought that would help bring me out that low place but it didnt. The same things didn’t bring me joy anymore cause i was no longer same person. The naive innocent little girl who entered that relationship died with it. I began smoking weed everyday and drinking just to cope with having to still live life. I was always the strong one emotionally so noone ever knew how i was really feeling and how i was still so close to giving up. 

Three months later i still can’t shake the feelings of hopelessness. It was like I couldn’t find where i belonged in this world anymore. I decide that it would be the night id go for it again and this time i wouldn’t fail. I decide to give my self a fun “last day” and spend majority of it just being out and about with my closest friends at that time. I had recently reconnected with an old friend (lets call him Sean and hit him up on some humbug shit. A part of me trying to prolong what i had planned.

We spend the night just smoking, talking, vibing. Before i know it its 4:00 in the morning. We end up having mind blowing sex. I didnt feel so miserable anymore, it made me rethink. Before i know if me and Sean start messing around heavy. After a month we make things exclusive. He’s shared all the issues he had going on at the time (he had been shot multiple times the year before and got arrested because the people that shot him claimed he was trying to rob them even though there was proof that it wasn’t true. So now he was fighting a case. ) i told him everything id been through in my last relationship. He helped me through having nightmares &amp;amp; panic attacks. Helped build my self confidence up. Basically he lifted me out of that darkness. 

Now here’s where the issues began, i hadn’t allowed myself to heal from my last relationship so i still reacted to things as i would have with my ex. Whenever me and Sean argued and it got really heated i got physical and always taunted him to be physical back. I constantly accused him of cheating, randomly went through his phone, etc. After we had our first son the physical stuff got worse. We would fight each other leaving scratches a small marks on each other. And the violence only got worse once i found the proof of him cheating and cheated back for get back (yes he knew. I told him the next day). Now we’re fighting multiple times a day both bruised, bloody, busted lips, you name it. Neither of us trusting the other one.

Then i end up pregnant with our youngest child. I expect the fighting to stop. I was always the one to throw the first lick in our fights so i figure just stop hitting him. Simple right? No. He no longer cared who threw the first hit. We’d grown accustomed to the fighting and he no longer had an issue hitting me first. We fought worse when i was pregnant than when i wasn’t. He’d choke me until i passed out. Id throw anything i can get my hands on at him. Me biting and scratching him. Us pulling each others hair out. 

Id turned my relationship into exactly what i had just escaped. Our most recent fight was yesterday. I dont even remember why. He choked me and scratched my neck up. Stomped me in the stomach multiple times. Hit me in the head with a bottle drawing lots of blood. Along with slamming against the wall a few times. I bit his arm until it bled. Kicked him in the nuts. Busted his lip. Scratched his arms and chest up. And threw a hair brush at him. I dont know how to get us out of this place. Both of us have horrible anger issues and will not hesitate to be physical with the other one

But when its good. Its good! Like even when we mad at each other we got each others back. He’s still my best friend. Our relationship is bipolar and i just want to remove the toxic elements and according to him. He does too. We want a better relationship and to show our kids better but have no idea where to even start 🤦🏾‍♀️",domesticviolence,I turned my current relationship into what I escaped in my previous relationship.

But I've been hit across the head a few times by him. (I know he's a POS and as soon as my safety plan us secured, I'm out, so please don't just tell me to get out. I want to and I'm going to) But in 5years time I've written off my memory problems and some other things that could be a TBI or it could be stress and PTSD! But I'm curious first off, is it even possible or likely, to get one from this kind of abuse? He's left some marks alright and he's not been gentle but like .. I've never needed medical intervention or paramedics called. The worst, (and what I wonder about having been the more harmful incident  then I initially realized is), being hit in the head while laying down already, so I didn't fall and I was on a bed. But I got very dizzy and I felt like I lost quite a few brain cells because although he walked away after that, I was talking to myself in gibberish I didn't even understand! He asked me to repeat myself one time as he heard me talking and I repeated the stupid question-that made zero sense and when he asked me WTF I was talking about I began crying again out of frustration because he didn't understand me. But at the time, even I didn't understand me and I knew I was making no sense. And I remember most of this actually all of it as far as I know. It's like the words were just falling out of my mouth and I couldn't stop them and I couldn't interject anyting sensible.

A few of these incidences have occurred in the last few years but I always end up being fine afterwards. Is it even possible that I have damaged that I don't know about? How would I bring this up to my doctor if I want to have it checked out? (Especially because I'm planning on filing charges against him when I leave for sexual assault)

We've been together for two years, and about four months ago we moved in together into a granny flat on my parents property.  They're always around, as they live in a bigger unit with my younger siblings (11F, 9M and 7M).  Before we moved, we'd occasionally get into arguments, but the worst he'd done before that was call me a cunt.  However, as we've been living together he's gotten worse.  When I bring up something that I'm upset about, he refuses to admit he's done anything wrong, it seems that suddenly it's all flipped around and I have to defend myself while he screams at me and calls me such foul things I can't repeat.  He has a bad temper when he drinks, and after an altercation with my dad he promised to not drink anymore.  He's kicked my dog in the ribs as hard as he could (she's a smaller dog).  My little sister saw my dad take him to the ground.  He's screamed in my mum's face.  He's punched walls, shoved me, locked me out of our flat and thrown my stuff around.  

It's recently got worse, as I had to buy a new phone and told him to save some money so we'd have enough for the fortnight.  He decided to still go ahead with online shopping, buying a new guitar and alcohol.  Normally, I don't care what he spends his money on, he's free to spend his money on his online shopping because I can save my money to make sure we don't go without.  I wasn't happy, but didn't say anything.  Unexpectedly, we ran out of money.  It was ok, I still had just enough smokes to get us through to payday.  However the night before when he was drinking, I noticed I had barely two smokes left.  I asked him about it, and he claimed to have no idea of what happened to it.  Before we went to bed, I gave him my last smoke and went into the bedroom irritated and upset.  When he asked what was wrong, I told him about how I asked him to save money and now we'd either have to smoke out of the ash tray or deal with nicotine withdrawals.  He said it wasn't his fault, he wanted to buy something for himself for once.  I brought up that I never buy anything for myself, I asked him not to once.  It was back and forth of him telling me I didn't need to buy a phone, and me trying to argue why I do need one.  Then, I brought up that he didn't need to buy a guitar and he said that he does *need* it.  He started calling me horrible names, and said I need to be supportive of his dreams to become a rockstar.  I told him that we live in the real world and need to survive first.    

Eventually I left to have a smoke out of the ash tray and was standing in the doorway, while he was yelling at me.  He said I drain him dry of money, ignoring that for most of the relationship I spend most of my paycheck buying him drugs.  He got pissed off I was having a smoke and demanded I get out of doorway, I told him my parents don't care where I smoke and I pay my rent.  It was like his eyes turned black.  He charged towards me and pushed me out of the room, he raised his hand and he smacked my arm hard, knocking the cigarette out of my hand and trying to slam the door in my face.  I pushed the door open and he cornered me against the door frame and hit my arm again.  I broke down crying. 

He told me to drop the crying act, that I brought it on myself by riling him up.  He called me some of the most foulest things I've heard in my life.  He said he couldn't believe he fell in love with someone like me.  Later when he calmed down he went to bed.  He promised he'd never do it again and apologised when I brought it up.  I feel shitty that I took him in when he was homeless, that I helped him out with money, helped him get a job and he does that to me.

Long story short... Husband (42 M)and I (39 F) bickered. Neither of us have ever been physically aggressive with each other before, but I grabbed his arm out of anger. He didn't talk to me for over 2 weeks and finally responded by waking me from a dead sleep to yell at me, spit in my face, tell me he wanted a divorce, choke me (super briefly), hit me in the face, punch a mirror, yell at me some more, take my ring, and then acted like I was doing something wrong for packing a bag and leaving the house. 

So, update is...the next day I waited for him to get home (with pepper spray hidden in my hand) from work and told him that we needed to talk on the weekend. Our schedules are pretty opposite so it is easy to avoid each other. There was an apology and an ""I'm a piece of shit"" but I told him I was tired and we'd talk later that weekend. Slept with a tire thumper in my bed that week in case. He was pretty much living in the basement. 

So the weekend comes. I come downstairs to talk. He just puts his arms out to hug me. I do. We lay there for a while. End up having sex several times, but never talked about anything really. The next day (yesterday), things feel good. We have a good morning together. We decide to go out for a late lunch. I am big on pictures so I take one of us. After a nice lunch we go to leave. In the car he asks to see the photo. I show him and he hits the back button and all photos come up. Well I had taken pictures of my pea sized bruise and the broken mirror. He says, ""oh what's that?"". 
Now I wanted to work things out, but that doesn't mean I was back to a point where I am comfortable that he isn't going to overreact to things. So I grabbed my phone, said they were just selfies. I took a few minutes to breathe and compose myself then tell him what they really were. Well he had obviously already figured that out. He is now pissed at me again because I tried to hide it. Says it is fucked up that I was trying to be secretive and what else am I going to be secretive about basically. 
He ended up retreating to the basement again when we got home. I was just enjoying the day after 3 weeks of hell and didn't want to spoil it. But because I took several minutes to tell the truth, apparently I'm in the wrong.

So I ran with my four children in the middle of the night to get away from my abusive husband. My friend picked us up and took us two hours and 45 mins away to her house to be safe. I have a preemie who is 7 pounds now ..a two year old...9 year old...and 12 year old. Apparently in the midst of grabbing everything from the house I forgot my wic Similac neosure for my baby and I just ran COMPLETELY out and no money to buy any and I honestly do not know what to do..I'm so scared. My friend who we moved in with is out of funds and I have no family. I called the pediatricians around here and none have any samples and hospital says they have a shortage for labor and delivery only right now. I am at a loss and so scared...anyone have any ideas because I'm out of all...oh the two local food banks here do not have ANY formula...idk I need prayers and help

I just want to give up but I know I can not do that because I am all that my four babies have. Especially now that I left and pretty much us 5 is all we have.. we have no other family and the only friend that we have is the one that is allowing us to live with her until we can get on our feet to get our own house. 

I just feel so hopeless and useless because I cannot even provide for my own children what kind of mother am I? Maybe I shouldn't have left or maybe I should go back and just deal with it for the well being of my children I do not know what to do or what to think I honestly just feel like a failure what I mean is I have failed as a mother...

I CALLED SIMILAC AND THEY ARE GOING TO SEND ME SOME FORMULA BUT IT TAKES AROUND 14 DAYS TO PROCESS THE ORDER THEN THEY SHIP IT OUT SO THE LADY ON THE PHONE SAID I CAN EXPECT IT AROUND 20 TO 30 DAYS OR A MONTH PRETTY MUCH.

I HAVE NONE TO GIVE MY SON SO I HAVE BEEN CALLING MESSAGING AND DOING EVERYTHING I CAN THINK OF TO AT LEAST COME UP WITH THE $24 TO BUY A CAN TO AT LEAST LAST TILL WIC APPOINTMENT THURSDAY. 

I HAD ASKED ALL MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY THE LOAN ME SOME MONEY OR TO EVEN SEND A VIRTUAL GIFT CARD AND I TOLD THEM I WOULD PAY THEM BACK FRIDAY AT MIDNIGHT TRIPLE THE AMOUNT. WHICH PRETTY MUCH MEANS THAT FOR $25 I WAS OFFERING TO GIVE THEM $75 AND THE LAST 2 PEOPLE I ASKED I TOLD THEM I WOULD PAY THEM BACK $100 FOR THE 25 AND NO SUCCESS YET BUT I CAN'T GIVE UP I HAVE TO FIGURE THIS OUT ASAP.",domesticviolence,I feel like I am drowning..,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/gqf5s3/i_feel_like_i_am_drowning/,True

They’re not stupid or ignorant, and they do the best anyone could. They’re not insecure or weak. They’re looking for the same things everyone else on this planet is.

They get therapy after the first abusive relationship and “put in the work”. They wait before going into another relationship, and know the signs. They excel and are happy in every other (non-romantic/sexual) area of their lives, usually, from career to finances to developing community and close friendships. They have strong senses of self and self-esteem.

They know the warning signs, and leave partners as soon as they begin to exhibit them. They seek and listen to anything a therapist or friend might say about a new partner’s vibe, personality, treatment.

They don’t die from the abuse, because they’re strong and smart enough to walk away.

But repeatedly, at a percentage significantly higher than the general population’s, they find themselves *having* to walk away from yet another abuser. Maybe the abuser hides all signs for the first few months, or even until a proposal or marriage. The abused woman isn’t stupid, and he fooled everyone else around her as well. She learned from her mistakes the first time. She sought others’ opinions and listened to her gut. 

Yet so many of us end up with yet another abuse story. We ultimately end up “safe”, sure, as we either leave or effectively give up and remain single.

These abusers ultimately reveal—after hiding or denying it previously—past partners they abused. I wouldn’t condone victim blaming, but I’d almost like to blame myself, as that’d give me some control here. But I can’t.

So, why is the ideal outcome of finding a loving, healthy, respectful partnership with someone we’re sexually attracted to so elusive and rare for us? Are we sexually geared to only be attracted to the pheromones of an abuser? Is that physically even possible? If it’s biological, is it possible to change this? Are we all doomed to biological infertility unless we do it all on our own? Are we just permanently damaged and destined to be single, or with an abuser? Why does this keep happening? Why does it keep happening to women who were happy on their own and with everything in their lives, aware of the signs, and so on?

And please, although I know there’s a massive selection bias here, and the stats show you’re the rarer case, if you have a success story that involves a happy, healthy marriage, please do share :)",domesticviolence,"Why do so many women who, after being abused once, end up alone or having to leave yet another abuser?",https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/gqfu74/why_do_so_many_women_who_after_being_abused_once/,True

There was a lot of other abuse prior to the whole skull part but the only other significant ones were: threatening to kill me and my mom while threatening to cut off his ankle monitor and biting my head because he thought I was on Facebook but found out I actually wasn't on Facebook and also when he pinned me to the bed for 3 hours, taunting me after punching me in the face while I held my daughter and was pregnant with our own. Yikes.   


He went to prison for 6 years on a 10 year sentence. Every single parole hearing, I fought it. I told the state ""No, he does not deserve to get out. No. He does not deserve to be free."" And the state even ruled him as a ""danger to society."" Awesome. Great. I achieved all that was necessary. But I never went to therapy. I never understood trauma bonding. I didn't understand why every 18 months or every time a parole hearing came around I would send him a nasty JPay message telling him how much I hated him. But he could never respond because I blocked any and all of his incoming mail. He once even tried to send me a package of jail books that actually got through with the paperwork he received from the prison showing him that I personally requested the blockade on the mail. As if I didn't know this already.  


And then in July 2019, he paroled. He was released to the county jail on detainers from the violations of protective order from 2013.  They were dismissed due to age. I got the text at 9PM on July 26th that he was to be released from county. I called his parents looking for him. I called the jail trying to find out where he was. I messaged his instagram, the only still-standing social media and contact I had with him and I waited. I waited around for two days. Pacing. Talking to my friends, waiting for him to message me. After six. years.   


And he did. He messaged me. He proclaimed his love for me. I proclaimed my love for him. And I fell right back in again. Keep in mind, I never received any therapy. No counseling. There was no resolution for my feelings and I never knew what trauma bonding was.  


Within two to three days of seeing him again, we were drinking one night after I got off of work and I went outside to smoke some pot really quickly. He was on parole and on an ankle monitor so he couldn't come with. I came back inside and he pulled me down the hallway by my hair. He pressed it must've been because he was drunk and jealous he couldn't smoke. I honestly knew this excuse was bullshit but I wanted him back so badly because my previous six years had been absolute hell and full of promiscuity and failed relationships.  


A few days after this, while having sex, buzzed again (he doesn't have any issues with drugs or alcohol btw, I had a bit of an issue and also wanted the alcohol to ease my feelings and nervousness with him) he put his hands around my throat and I fought him off of me and scratched his face and he finally let go of my throat.  


He was good for a while... Released from prison July 27th, 2019. Only two small incidents, you know? Until August 17th, 2019. We were drinking. I blame myself for the drinking parts, honestly. But I do not blame myself for his violence. We BBQ'ed. It was an awesome time. It was fun, in fact. He let me do the BBQ'ing. I've never gotten to do that before. We put our daughter to bed who had just learned days before this that he was her father. How exciting. Six years without a dad and now you can match your stomach moles and beautiful, full lips with the man who helped create you.   


Around 12AM, quite a few drinks later. He got mad at me. I don't know for what. I can't remember for what. But I wanted to go home and I told him I wanted to go home. And he grabbed my phone. And he smashed it into the wood planked floors. And I knew exactly what was coming after that. It was the same exact thing that happened in 2013. I knew it was coming. And I still couldn't help but mouth ""Here comes 2013 (insert his name) again."" He charged me and he smacked me and I was SHOOK. I went to the bathroom and could see the bruising that aligned the inside of his finger tips above my lip. I told him I was leaving and I went to grab our daughter. I started walking to the front door and he shoved me. He shoved me so hard I fell and I instinctively moved our daughter to the side because I knew what was coming.   


He smacked me. Open hand. Over and over and over and over again. Blood flew down the hallway. Some of it as far as 4-5ft away from where my body sat upon impact. He shoved me into the bathroom and stuck our daughter on the cell phone to watch a show while I stood and bled in the shower and cried. I tried to step out in an effort to calm and comfort him because I was in pure survival mode at this point and I saw him pouring bleach down the entire hallway and cleaning up -- what was literally -- the crime scene. He bleached it like a murder scene out of a movie and I slunk back into the bathroom.  


I looked at myself in the mirror and I knew I had to do some kind of manipulation to get out of there. I put my daughter in bed, her pajamas covered in my blood. And I told her mommy was okay and we would be going home soon.  


I spent an hour convincing him that I was okay and he wasn't going back to prison and I instructed him on how to care for my wounds. I helped him get me an ice pack and inflammatory medications. And he helped dress my wounds. I convinced him to call a fellow felon and his old prison cell mate who we had just FaceTimed earlier that day. I told him if I was going to go home, this is someone he could trust and someone we could confide in to not go to the police as he was on parole as well (bank robbery, no victims). He would call his friend a few times and his friend kept trying to get through to him. My boyfriend would give me the window to start telling this guy the address and then he would hang up. He was taunting me. The friend would call again. My boyfriend finally gave me the space to say the whole address. He had to drive from 2 hours away. But he did it.  


At some point, while bloody and swollen, chunks of my hair easily brushed away from my head, he asked me ""So what's up, you wanna fuck?"" And I let him. It's so entirely fucked up but I let him right then and there. And then in the middle of it, there was a knock at the door. It was finally my saving grace, his friend. His friend tried, and I could see it, he tried to contain his horrific reaction. He stared at me and put his hand behind my back and guided me to get our daughter. He stood right behind me and in between my boyfriend and guided me to the car. We got my daughter strapped in. He helped me.  


He went back inside while I strapped in the carseat and was talking to my boyfriend. I came back in, why? I don't know. But I did. And I ran my hand through my bloody, matted hair. I got to the back of my head and a huge chunk of hair came out and onto my hand. And I handed it to my boyfriend. And said ""Here you go."" He asked me ""What? Do you want some more?"" And he laughed. He laughed at me in front of this person that was supposed to save me.  


And his friend said ""Go wait in the car."" At that moment, I was trusting my life in the hands of someone I had never met before. And the friend came and got in the car. And he drove me home. And on the way home, he told me that he had no idea of my husband's charges and that he had hidden all of his charges in prison and stated the assault he was convicted of was on a man. And then this friend told me how his father had killed his mother. And that's why he started robbing banks after being put in foster care. And he warned me. And warned me. And begged me not to return. He told me he didn't care how far the relationship went with his ex-celly, that my presence and my situation hit home for him far more and was far more important than someone he went to prison with. And I couldn't be more grateful for this man's existence. Honestly.  


Anyway so I went to the hospital after that. I had a burner phone (learned from the first time). I had called EMS and they did a transport. No broken bones, etc. Just some stitches this time, by the grace of God.  


And then on September 6th, 2019... I married him. Not the friend. But my boyfriend. I married my boyfriend that had just beaten the life out of me and I had to beg for freedom for two weeks later. I got married with two black eyes.   


And the abuse continued. Of course it continued. Why wouldn't it?  


From December 2019 to January 2020, in a 2 week period... 14 days. He had laid his hands on me and threatened to kill me 9 times.   


It was on a Sunday that he last hit me. I waited and tried to persevere all day. I was constantly having mental breakdowns at this point because of the abuse (and he would come in and be captain save this girl and skip work to help my mental state by over coddling me from the pain he had caused, really). He went to work that next Monday morning and I called into work. I told him I needed to take time and just be okay mentally and he agreed and he left for work. I packed all of his essentials into a laundry basket and set them by the door. Around 3PM that day, I told him that he would not be coming home that night and he had to stay elsewhere. He detested that idea. He insisted he at least come by to pick up essentials to stay with his mother and I told him no. I told him he was not welcome to come pick up his things and if he came, I would call the police. Because I knew at that moment, if he came home, he would either a) beat the life of out of me/kill me or b) lure me in all over again. Honestly, in hindsight, I think B would be attempted and when it wasn't applicable, A would happen.  


He then proceeded to threaten me. He told me that I was going to need my gun if I ever saw him again (I got a gun in 2017 actually to protect myself against him, again, yikes). He told me he was going to come and kill me. We had shared location settings on our iPhones (I cleaned houses all over the southern part of our state for a living and some people were sketchy, I was by myself a lot and it was a safety measure prompted by me. Although I'm sure he loved it too bc he could keep an eye on me) I could see he was on his way to me. So I called his cousin who had seen me battered and bruised in August -- coincidentally I had just been in a very bad car crash so I blamed my bruising on that when she happened upon me accidentally... But one night in the kitchen (he was paroled to her house) she told me, in front of him, that if he ever abused me, she didn't care if he was family or not, I could come to her. And she could be my safe space. So I called her that day. I told her ""Do you remember this talk we had in the kitchen? 2013 was because of me. The bruising wasn't from the car crash. And now he's on his way to kill me."" And she told me ""I'm on my way.""  


But the problem was -- she wasn't on her way. She contacted him to see where he was and he immediately drove back to work. She went to his work. WITH ALL GOOD INTENTIONS, MIND YOU. She wanted to intercept him. I get that. I understand that. And from her view -- she did. She succeeded in that and at no point in time can I fault her for this. But she never told me this. She told me she was coming to me and she lived 17 minutes away. 30 minutes passed and she never came and he was still erratically texting me and I called 911.  


The police came, and they told me they couldn't protect me and wait around all night. So they took me with them to the police station after I packed a bag. And they took a statement and in the middle of the statement is when I received a call from his cousin. She told me she was with him and that he was calm and would be staying at her house that night. And then she handed the phone to him. And my eyes bulged and I hung up. She texted me apologizing for not understanding but still.   


So unknowingly really, I made the statement against my now husband. And he's now sitting on a $175,000 bond for 2 counts of family violence, 1 count continuous family violence, a parole violation, and a violation of a protective order and honestly? I don't think he's ever coming home. I supplied the detective with multiple admissions of guilt (such as: Are you ever going to apologize for slamming my head into the ground? ::  I'm sorry).   


I don't know. I don't know why I've typed all of this. I am safe. And I know of trauma bonding now. And I know that I am severely trauma bonding and I am trying to break these holds as we speak.   


I just want to kind of put my story out there and tell you guys:  


Please. Take the resources of counseling. Take the family support. Take everything. Be as selfish and greedy as you can be in your HEALTHY recovery. Or you may end up being as selfish and greedy as I was in re-obtaining the love I once thought I had.

And then my ex brought his friend home. And me and that friend bonded over his dog (I'm obsessed with dogs). For some reason the friend started staying the night on the couch downstairs. And I relished those days because I wouldn't be hurt. And slowly the abuse happened less and less because that friend stayed five plus nights a week on average.

I’m posting this for a friend. 
My friend (47) has been abused by her husband (60) for the last 25 years. He’s a narcissist with anger issues who sees himself as a victim in his own life. He’s incredibly verbally, emotionally financially and sexually abusive. He isolated her when she was 23 and he was in his late 30s. He’s taken up the best years of her life and if she doesn’t leave she will either kill herself or the stress will kill her. She lives in MN but she is originally from Turkey. She’s a citizen. She had 4 children, most of whom are adults. The younger two are in high school or going to college. The husband threatens to not pay for their college if she leaves them and he tells tha children. Her youngest has anxiety and is always worried that her mother is going to leave her behind or that she won’t get to go to college. She has places to go but doesn’t feel like she can leave. She has no self esteem and no degree. She’s financially dependent on him and so are her children. If there was a way that she could safely leave and have some financial leverage from him she would.  The situation is much more complex than this obviously and her plan is to leave in two years when her youngest will be going to college but that’s too far away and she’s getting worse everyday.

We were arguing (we were both frustrated by something we were doing, but he was admittedly a lot more sleep deprived than me). I was very frustrated both with the task at hand and him. I felt that he wasn't being reasonable with regards to the situation (he was trying to complete something that just wasn't working out, and he was spending hours on it) plus he was expecting me to help him endlessly and I was getting very frustrated.

&amp;#x200B;

A verbal argument erupted and it just didn't go well. I don't even recall exactly what was being said, but he was shouting at me and I was telling him that the project was never going to work out (I was being realistic but not very supportive). I don't know what was said that made him snap, but he came over and grabbed my arm, hard. He's grabbed me before and we agreed he would never put his hands on me again, so I pushed him back off me. He then head-butted me in the forehead.

&amp;#x200B;

It really hurt and (3 days later) I still have headaches. He did apologize but told me it was also my fault for escalating the fight when he was stressed and sleep deprived.

I *want* to let it go. I want to accept his apology and his promises that this will never happen again, and accept that I had a hand in it by being horrible when he was so tired and stressed out.

I got out my iPad, which has been in a cabinet for at least a few years, opened the Chrome app, and opened a new tab. It showed me my browsing history, and it showed me my ex-husband's browsing history for over a year or two, even current stuff by month. I haven't seen him for six months. 

Apparently he had logged in with his work gmail account on my iPad at some point in the past, years ago, and I had access to everything current and past, including his coworker's login to zoom with password already entered (I can't read the password but I could just hit login and be in his account). 

I had a friend help me log out of my ex's account and then clear the history, but I wanted to let you know that if you have a stalker or someone who would and could use this information, this is a huge vulnerability. If you have used a device to log in to chrome, that device retains the information - even current information - if you are using a different device.

I cleared his history off that, as well.

After we got married I saw a decline in him. He has OCD and can become very obsessed with things, he’s either all in or not in at all. He started smoking weed about a month before we got married and quickly became obsessed. Spending $400 a mo or more on weed. Smoking almost everyday. He started going to work high, family events, etc. I talked to him and explained I didn’t care if he smoked but he needs to do it in moderation. This did not happen. A few months after smoking he started to complain about how unhappy he is at his job which he has been there for 3 years. Now it’s unbearable for him. He won’t look for another job and has just stayed with his current one. When he gets a work call or has to go in we will get very angry and throw things and yell. I can see that he is depressed. Around November I think he got a antidepressant and has been taking it constantly but I’ve seen no change. He gets it from our family doctor and does not see a psychiatrist or therapist. Things are just continuing to escalate. I have a feeling he might be bi polar. We will have really great days even weeks followed by really really bad days. There’s no in between it’s either really good or really bad. In December he had a bad day and was in a horrible mood I went to talk to him and he got up ran to me picked me up choked me and slammed me on the table. I was shocked. He left so angry that night he finally came back and did not apologize until the next day. I did forgive him hoping he would change. Things only got worse. He works 9-5 and will go to sleep at 7:30 or 8. He hardly eats. He’s lost 20 pounds in 5 months which is a lot of him. He’s 6’2 and usually weighs about 175ish. Things upset him very easily. A few days ago we got into a huge fight. I’ve been dealing with the negativity for months now trying to support him and love him even though I always get pushed away. It really starts to wear down on you. He had a really ugly attitude and I just lost it and got upset with him just telling him to leave and I followed him to the garage as he was leaving yelling at him. I know I shouldn’t have it was wrong of me but I snapped. He turned around and lunges at me and put me in a chockehold for what felt like forever. He then punched the door and broke it. I have never felt so scared.
He’s punched 3 doors, dented our fridge by punching it, broke a trash can by throwing it. 
He started a new thing when he gets upset where he punches himself in the face even gave himself a bruise. 
I am so freaking lost. This is not the man I married. I have my faults. I’m not claiming to be innocent. But I do not physically harm him when I’m upset. 
I have stressed to him that he needs professional help and that I will love him through it but he won’t. I’ve gotten his parents and brother involved but nothing has changed. 
I honestly don’t know what to do and I’m scared for the next time he gets upset. 
I love him he’s my bestfriend but when he gets upset or is having a low day I don’t know who he is... 
This is a lot to type. I’m sure I’ve forgotten somethings. I just need someone to point me in the right direction. 

I would also like to add he is consistently talking about killing himself and how much he hates his life. When someone you love says this all the time for months it begins to wear down on you.

I don’t know where else to put it. My husband was shit-faced drunk and was lying upstairs on the floor. I let him sit for about 30 minutes and then checked on him. I asked if he wanted something to eat and then I brought him a piece of toast and some water. I then left him alone for another 30 minutes and then came back and tried to get ready for bed. He then pinned me down and tried to strangle me. I laughed at first because I didn’t know what to do and figured he was fine.

I then started feeling like I couldn’t breathe. I was in the middle of flossing my teeth so I tried to jam my flosser in his face. He laid off and went away. I laid there for a few minutes and then went on getting ready for bed. He then said “you enjoyed stabbing me in the face, right?”. I have given him the silent treatment since.

He has said “are you so mad that you’re trying to kill the cats” and “did you mean what you meant downstairs” and “they don’t deserve to be involved with this” as ways to attempt to manipulate my emotions. None of this is real.

Get out now??

I love this man. We have been married for almost a year. We have been together for almost six years. I love our life together, and I couldn’t imagine my life any differently. I really don’t want to leave because I am usually so happy with him.

He just offered to sleep in the other room, if that helps?

I am not sure if this is the place I could post about my situation, because I have not really been the one that's gone through the physical abuse part, but I was a witness of it for a few years back when I was younger. I'm 20 now. When I was about 14, my dad started physically and emotionally abusing my mother, the emotional abuse had actually started way before that, but that's when it escalated to something else. 

I remember a lot of things very vividly. A lot of things I've heard that I should not have, I've seen a lot of things I shouldn't have. The abuse had started because my dad was a very jealous and possessive guy (what a surprise) and always had suspicions that my mom was cheating on him. So one day he brutally beats her up, parts of her hair were missing, she had a lot of bruises and was almost unrecognisable, avoiding to look at me. Many adults knew about the abuse from day 1 and no one offered a hand. I'm not saying I'm the victim here, obviously it's my mom that had it the worst. But it just breaks my heart and leaves me very conflicted about everything in my life. 

My father had been locking my mom, beating her, blackmailing her, throwing things at her, taking all her documents (because he was afraid she would run away or leave the country), he had made her write in a notebook about all her sexual encounters and then made her read it to us, while he would hit her after every sentence that he gets annoyed by. He threatened to cut her in parts and send her to her mom if she tries to run away or do anything without his permission. He drove all of us in a car while being completely drunk and hitting her while driving. 

I am COMPLETELY devastated and I really have no clue about what to do with myself. Not sure if therapy works, it always ends up being about me forgiving my father. And I am really not capable of that. I can't forgive a monster that ruined all of my family members' lives. I can't live with this.

I can't even fully have him out of my life, because they are still together (the physical abuse is not happening anymore), but I can't pretend to not remember anything and it's sort of made me get distanced from my mother as well. And I have so many things to tell her. That I've always been on her side, that I'll always protect her as much as I can and I want to say sorry for everything she's gone through. I'm also sorry if she sees him in me and that creates a bigger distance between us. But I understand it.

I left him about 2 weeks ago. It’s been draining for me and right now I don’t see the light at the end of the tunnel. I feel sick without him, like my chest caves in every time I think about the fact that we’re over. I’m in a really tough situation right now because I think that I may be pregnant. While I was with him he would sometimes either beat me until I almost blacked out or waited until I was sleep to have unprotected sex with me. A year ago when I secretly got on birth control that didn’t go well and he made me stop taking it. I ended up getting pregnant and I miscarried at 10 weeks. I didn’t know I was pregnant until I miscarries. Ever since then he would have unprotected sex with me while I was sleep or almost unconscious. It’s really weird and traumatizing having to wake up to that. 

I have not taken a pregnancy test but I am sure I’m most likely pregnant. I have already had an abortion when I was 16 on top of the miscarriage last year. I am a red to get another abortion. I feel like karma or something will happen in the future when I do want kids By the right person. I still love him but I know it’s dumb to have a kid by him right now. I feel like another abortion is gonna cause issues. 

I am currently at my moms house and I told her about me potentially being pregnant and she was upset and disappointed. She’s been basically ignoring me since I’ve been here and I am scared of how she’ll react if I tell her that I want an abortion. I feel like I sound like a little girl but I really would like the support of my mother during this time. She’s very judgemental when it comes to things like this. Plus I disobeyed her trying to and ran away with him when I turned 18 after dealing with him as a teen. She told me not to repeatedly but I didn’t listen. 

I feel like I put myself in a stupid situation. My mom says that if I don’t press charges on him while I still have “proof” (bruises, scars, etc.) then I will have to leave. I understand but I am just not ready to do that. I don’t want to press charges just yet. I’m not planning on going back to him but I’m not in the right headspace  to do all of this.

I just feel like this heartbreak won’t ever end. He’s called me numerous times and his last text said that he’ll give me my space but we’re goin got talk. I haven’t responded to him. I’m thinking about showing my mom that I haven’t spoken to him and that I’ll block his number. Just to give her some faith that I won’t go back and hopefully she’ll get off my back about making a report.

I don’t want to remember every detail, yet going to court has almost hammered this habit in to me where I must describe it all despite the amount of pain I was in.

I feel as though court itself can cause even more trauma. Having to be choked out by whatever spineless lawyer takes their case, defends them, and actively tries to attack you. This new behavior of recalling everything, dates, times, action and reactions has a play by play running through my head every evening until I cry and eventually fall asleep. Recollection I understand, but to have so much apprehension of events that haven’t happened yet? Even worse. “What if I have to court for xyz, what points do I make? I need to make a list of everything so I don’t miss anything like I did before.”

But the thing is... I’m not there anymore. I had gotten rid of my abuser in October. So why is it I can’t shake it now? Why do I dread going to sleep every night if the real nightmare is over?

He did lose his parents back to back which prompted him to join the infantry and experienced life/death situation in Afghanistan. Long story short, we dated for 4 months and I noticed that his comprehension and communication went nowhere especially after he reenlisted with out telling me. We had ""rules"" to abide by, curfews. He was toxic, had a manipulative behavior, and didnt take criticism well. In a disagreement he'd throw Divorce like it was nothing. I could only shut up and cry and the cycle would repeat. He always bent rules and did things that were petty. 

Most of the times, I had to be the bigger person to stay sane and human, always forgave, with open arms. I was so confused, I asked his older sister of 7 years if his behavior was Normal (she actually worked for DV victims) what stood out to me most was her advising me to busy myself...that's how it went for 4 years

--I retaliated to be seen as equal and he'd push back--breaking my things, talking to women, distancing himself. It was agony, I begged for counseling 3 years before I gave birth to my daughter, but he had a twisted view on therapy and counselors. Fast-forward until now, I fought back verbally standing up for myself--I wanted an equal household I wanted love, I gave birth to our precious girl and I was fighting pregnancy discrimination at my work to provide for our family while he left the military to babysit our girl, I was learning how to be a new parent and still dealing with his tantrums. He did finally acknowledge he needed October 2019 help, thank God, I held onto hope and it was here thank you..... but he thought getting the help at a specific time was better--I pleaded, begged, cried---he delayed it and Beat me Jan 19 2020. A few days before my birthday, the same week our girl walked for the first time. I can forget how he grabbed my hair and slammed me into the bassinet, kicked me on thr ground twice. He boxed my ears and hit my face when he pulled me back in to explain he messed up. He wrestled me instead and the neighbors called the cops.

His military friends and many of his friends supported him through this which was great and the VA has loads of resources and help. Covid19 delayed our couples therapy and I was on the waitinglist for individual therapy, he's had his sessions and still ongoing with the VA.

Hes turning into 90% Gandhi and Im self-sabotaging, pushing him away, making it worse. All the poison he poured into me was seeping out. Ive ruined it now, I cant stop the verbal diarrhea, the paranoia and the emotions of exhaustion and fear, if he was going to revert back to his old ways. He's getting better and Im broken. After everything Ive been through with him, all I want is to be held by him and feel the safety I felt when we first met, but its mingled with fear and bitterness. He sees a positive future, but Ive ended it b/c of the anxiety Monster Ive become. Im sorry to my husband and my daughter.

Last night was bad.. my partner started yelling at me because I was sad over my grandma being hospitalized and possibly not going to make it. I just wanted him to comfort me or give me some encouraging words but he was on his phone and instead he got up from the bed and started yelling at me and cursing, going back and forth in the house still cursing at me and yelling then hit the bed. He told me to leave him the fuck alone so I spent the night on the couch. While all this was happening I felt like it was not real and I was watching from someone else’s point of view. I was shaking and crying for a long time. I woke up with a huge headache and I was just physically feeling sick all day. 

This morning he was apologizing asking if I was going to leave him. After work I came home and he was here telling me I’m beautiful, best thing that ever happened to him and he was sorry and if I still hated him. I never said I hated him, I told him I felt he hated me because he always talks to me like I’ve ruined his life. 
I’m laying in bed and just thinking and feeling down. He’s came to check on me but I don’t want him to touch me. I feel like I’m being too harsh but I don’t know how to feel.

2013, boyfriend at the time beat me so severely I had reconstructive surgery and some titanium put into my skull to prevent my eye from falling into the back of my head because my orbital floor was blown out. He went to jail. Bonded out. I was right there with him when he bonded out. As a matter of fact, I CHALLENGED him to bond out. I didn't think he could put up the $10k. But he did. I was pregnant at the time and strung him along from July to August, just lashing out and taking my pain out on him but still seeing him frequently. Typing this, I realize how fucked up it was that he was able to come to my house and be angry during this window and the worst he did to me was throw a cup of Mountain Dew across the room out of frustration because I kicked him out after making him bring me Taco Bell (here's a key indicator that no, he doesn't have anger issues... nor issues of control). There was a lot of other abuse prior to the whole skull part but the only other significant ones were: threatening to kill me and my mom while threatening to cut off his ankle monitor and biting my head because he thought I was on Facebook but found out I actually wasn't on Facebook and also when he pinned me to the bed for 3 hours, taunting me after punching me in the face while I held my daughter and was pregnant with our own. Yikes.   


He went to prison for 6 years on a 10 year sentence. Every single parole hearing, I fought it. I told the state ""No, he does not deserve to get out. No. He does not deserve to be free."" And the state even ruled him as a ""danger to society."" Awesome. Great. I achieved all that was necessary. But I never went to therapy. I never understood trauma bonding. I didn't understand why every 18 months or every time a parole hearing came around I would send him a nasty JPay message telling him how much I hated him. But he could never respond because I blocked any and all of his incoming mail. He once even tried to send me a package of jail books that actually got through with the paperwork he received from the prison showing him that I personally requested the blockade on the mail. As if I didn't know this already.  


And then in July 2019, he paroled. He was released to the county jail on detainers from the violations of protective order from 2013.  They were dismissed due to age. I got the text at 9PM on July 26th that he was to be released from county. I called his parents looking for him. I called the jail trying to find out where he was. I messaged his instagram, the only still-standing social media and contact I had with him and I waited. I waited around for two days. Pacing. Talking to my friends, waiting for him to message me. After six. years.   


And he did. He messaged me. He proclaimed his love for me. I proclaimed my love for him. And I fell right back in again. Keep in mind, I never received any therapy. No counseling. There was no resolution for my feelings and I never knew what trauma bonding was.  


Within two to three days of seeing him again, we were drinking one night after I got off of work and I went outside to smoke some pot really quickly. He was on parole and on an ankle monitor so he couldn't come with. I came back inside and he pulled me down the hallway by my hair. He pressed it must've been because he was drunk and jealous he couldn't smoke. I honestly knew this excuse was bullshit but I wanted him back so badly because my previous six years had been absolute hell and full of promiscuity and failed relationships.  


A few days after this, while having sex, buzzed again (he doesn't have any issues with drugs or alcohol btw, I had a bit of an issue and also wanted the alcohol to ease my feelings and nervousness with him) he put his hands around my throat and I fought him off of me and scratched his face and he finally let go of my throat.  


He was good for a while... Released from prison July 27th, 2019. Only two small incidents, you know? Until August 17th, 2019. We were drinking. I blame myself for the drinking parts, honestly. But I do not blame myself for his violence. We BBQ'ed. It was an awesome time. It was fun, in fact. He let me do the BBQ'ing. I've never gotten to do that before. We put our daughter to bed who had just learned days before this that he was her father. How exciting. Six years without a dad and now you can match your stomach moles and beautiful, full lips with the man who helped create you.   


Around 12AM, quite a few drinks later. He got mad at me. I don't know for what. I can't remember for what. But I wanted to go home and I told him I wanted to go home. And he grabbed my phone. And he smashed it into the wood planked floors. And I knew exactly what was coming after that. It was the same exact thing that happened in 2013. I knew it was coming. And I still couldn't help but mouth ""Here comes 2013 (insert his name) again."" He charged me and he smacked me and I was SHOOK. I went to the bathroom and could see the bruising that aligned the inside of his finger tips above my lip. I told him I was leaving and I went to grab our daughter. I started walking to the front door and he shoved me. He shoved me so hard I fell and I instinctively moved our daughter to the side because I knew what was coming.   


He smacked me. Open hand. Over and over and over and over again. Blood flew down the hallway. Some of it as far as 4-5ft away from where my body sat upon impact. He shoved me into the bathroom and stuck our daughter on the cell phone to watch a show while I stood and bled in the shower and cried. I tried to step out in an effort to calm and comfort him because I was in pure survival mode at this point and I saw him pouring bleach down the entire hallway and cleaning up -- what was literally -- the crime scene. He bleached it like a murder scene out of a movie and I slunk back into the bathroom.  


I looked at myself in the mirror and I knew I had to do some kind of manipulation to get out of there. I put my daughter in bed, her pajamas covered in my blood. And I told her mommy was okay and we would be going home soon.  


I spent an hour convincing him that I was okay and he wasn't going back to prison and I instructed him on how to care for my wounds. I helped him get me an ice pack and inflammatory medications. And he helped dress my wounds. I convinced him to call a fellow felon and his old prison cell mate who we had just FaceTimed earlier that day. I told him if I was going to go home, this is someone he could trust and someone we could confide in to not go to the police as he was on parole as well (bank robbery, no victims). He would call his friend a few times and his friend kept trying to get through to him. My boyfriend would give me the window to start telling this guy the address and then he would hang up. He was taunting me. The friend would call again. My boyfriend finally gave me the space to say the whole address. He had to drive from 2 hours away. But he did it.  


At some point, while bloody and swollen, chunks of my hair easily brushed away from my head, he asked me ""So what's up, you wanna fuck?"" And I let him. It's so entirely fucked up but I let him right then and there. And then in the middle of it, there was a knock at the door. It was finally my saving grace, his friend. His friend tried, and I could see it, he tried to contain his horrific reaction. He stared at me and put his hand behind my back and guided me to get our daughter. He stood right behind me and in between my boyfriend and guided me to the car. We got my daughter strapped in. He helped me.  


He went back inside while I strapped in the carseat and was talking to my boyfriend. I came back in, why? I don't know. But I did. And I ran my hand through my bloody, matted hair. I got to the back of my head and a huge chunk of hair came out and onto my hand. And I handed it to my boyfriend. And said ""Here you go."" He asked me ""What? Do you want some more?"" And he laughed. He laughed at me in front of this person that was supposed to save me.  


And his friend said ""Go wait in the car."" At that moment, I was trusting my life in the hands of someone I had never met before. And the friend came and got in the car. And he drove me home. And on the way home, he told me that he had no idea of my husband's charges and that he had hidden all of his charges in prison and stated the assault he was convicted of was on a man. And then this friend told me how his father had killed his mother. And that's why he started robbing banks after being put in foster care. And he warned me. And warned me. And begged me not to return. He told me he didn't care how far the relationship went with his ex-celly, that my presence and my situation hit home for him far more and was far more important than someone he went to prison with. And I couldn't be more grateful for this man's existence. Honestly.  


Anyway so I went to the hospital after that. I had a burner phone (learned from the first time). I had called EMS and they did a transport. No broken bones, etc. Just some stitches this time, by the grace of God.  


And then on September 6th, 2019... I married him. Not the friend. But my boyfriend. I married my boyfriend that had just beaten the life out of me and I had to beg for freedom for two weeks later. I got married with two black eyes.   


And the abuse continued. Of course it continued. Why wouldn't it?  


From December 2019 to January 2020, in a 2 week period... 14 days. He had laid his hands on me and threatened to kill me 9 times.   


It was on a Sunday that he last hit me. I waited and tried to persevere all day. I was constantly having mental breakdowns at this point because of the abuse (and he would come in and be captain save this girl and skip work to help my mental state by over coddling me from the pain he had caused, really). He went to work that next Monday morning and I called into work. I told him I needed to take time and just be okay mentally and he agreed and he left for work. I packed all of his essentials into a laundry basket and set them by the door. Around 3PM that day, I told him that he would not be coming home that night and he had to stay elsewhere. He detested that idea. He insisted he at least come by to pick up essentials to stay with his mother and I told him no. I told him he was not welcome to come pick up his things and if he came, I would call the police. Because I knew at that moment, if he came home, he would either a) beat the life of out of me/kill me or b) lure me in all over again. Honestly, in hindsight, I think B would be attempted and when it wasn't applicable, A would happen.  


He then proceeded to threaten me. He told me that I was going to need my gun if I ever saw him again (I got a gun in 2017 actually to protect myself against him, again, yikes). He told me he was going to come and kill me. We had shared location settings on our iPhones (I cleaned houses all over the southern part of our state for a living and some people were sketchy, I was by myself a lot and it was a safety measure prompted by me. Although I'm sure he loved it too bc he could keep an eye on me) I could see he was on his way to me. So I called his cousin who had seen me battered and bruised in August -- coincidentally I had just been in a very bad car crash so I blamed my bruising on that when she happened upon me accidentally... But one night in the kitchen (he was paroled to her house) she told me, in front of him, that if he ever abused me, she didn't care if he was family or not, I could come to her. And she could be my safe space. So I called her that day. I told her ""Do you remember this talk we had in the kitchen? 2013 was because of me. The bruising wasn't from the car crash. And now he's on his way to kill me."" And she told me ""I'm on my way.""  


But the problem was -- she wasn't on her way. She contacted him to see where he was and he immediately drove back to work. She went to his work. WITH ALL GOOD INTENTIONS, MIND YOU. She wanted to intercept him. I get that. I understand that. And from her view -- she did. She succeeded in that and at no point in time can I fault her for this. But she never told me this. She told me she was coming to me and she lived 17 minutes away. 30 minutes passed and she never came and he was still erratically texting me and I called 911.  


The police came, and they told me they couldn't protect me and wait around all night. So they took me with them to the police station after I packed a bag. And they took a statement and in the middle of the statement is when I received a call from his cousin. She told me she was with him and that he was calm and would be staying at her house that night. And then she handed the phone to him. And my eyes bulged and I hung up. She texted me apologizing for not understanding but still.   


So unknowingly really, I made the statement against my now husband. And he's now sitting on a $175,000 bond for 2 counts of family violence, 1 count continuous family violence, a parole violation, and a violation of a protective order and honestly? I don't think he's ever coming home. I supplied the detective with multiple admissions of guilt (such as: Are you ever going to apologize for slamming my head into the ground? ::  I'm sorry).   


I don't know. I don't know why I've typed all of this. I am safe. And I know of trauma bonding now. And I know that I am severely trauma bonding and I am trying to break these holds as we speak.   


I just want to kind of put my story out there and tell you guys:  


Please. Take the resources of counseling. Take the family support. Take everything. Be as selfish and greedy as you can be in your HEALTHY recovery. Or you may end up being as selfish and greedy as I was in re-obtaining the love I once thought I had.

I’m posting this for a friend. 
My friend (47) has been abused by her husband (60) for the last 25 years. He’s a narcissist with anger issues who sees himself as a victim in his own life. He’s incredibly verbally, emotionally financially and sexually abusive. He isolated her when she was 23 and he was in his late 30s. He’s taken up the best years of her life and if she doesn’t leave she will either kill herself or the stress will kill her. She lives in MN but she is originally from Turkey. She’s a citizen. She had 4 children, most of whom are adults. The younger two are in high school or going to college. The husband threatens to not pay for their college if she leaves them and he tells tha children. Her youngest has anxiety and is always worried that her mother is going to leave her behind or that she won’t get to go to college. She has places to go but doesn’t feel like she can leave. She has no self esteem and no degree. She’s financially dependent on him and so are her children. If there was a way that she could safely leave and have some financial leverage from him she would.  The situation is much more complex than this obviously and her plan is to leave in two years when her youngest will be going to college but that’s too far away and she’s getting worse everyday.

We were arguing (we were both frustrated by something we were doing, but he was admittedly a lot more sleep deprived than me). I was very frustrated both with the task at hand and him. I felt that he wasn't being reasonable with regards to the situation (he was trying to complete something that just wasn't working out, and he was spending hours on it) plus he was expecting me to help him endlessly and I was getting very frustrated.

&amp;#x200B;

A verbal argument erupted and it just didn't go well. I don't even recall exactly what was being said, but he was shouting at me and I was telling him that the project was never going to work out (I was being realistic but not very supportive). I don't know what was said that made him snap, but he came over and grabbed my arm, hard. He's grabbed me before and we agreed he would never put his hands on me again, so I pushed him back off me. He then head-butted me in the forehead.

Picked her up and threw her onto the bed and then tried smothering her with a pillow. I screamed at him and told him if he did it again I was calling the police. He responded by saying I was being dramatic and to stop crying. (He often gaslights me during our conversations)
I was so freaked out that I ended up bringing her to work with me because he’s currently working from home remotely during this while I still have to go in.

So yesterday, I (f29) made dinner for my partner (m29). I worked the night shift and gotten a few hours of sleep through the day so I was pretty tired by dinner time. 
He got home, after going work and then hanging out with his brother. We had dinner and I got up to clear the plates. He said thank you multiple times and dinner was very nice.
I asked him cheekily if he’s so grateful maybe he could give me a hand clearing up? And he said he didn’t wanna get up so soon after eating and I was like okay sure I understand.
I took the plates into the kitchen and a few mins later he came into the kitchen too I didn’t see what he did though coz I had my back to him.
I honestly thought he was gonna help me tidy up a bit.. but then he sat back down and when I turned looked he was sitting there rolling up a smoke while I tidied up. 
I sat back down in the living and I felt a bit down coz I guess I was left to tidy up while he was rolling a smoke?!
Anyway I didn’t say anything and he asked what was wrong so I said it would’ve been nice if you helped tidy up a bit while you were up anyway and he got super defensive so I just said okay cool and just left it alone and watched tv
And then he asked why I was so closed off and I’m like what dyu mean, and he just started ranting at me? 
He got seriously angry and started calling me a motherfucker, a cunt, he got up and went to the bedroom and slammed the door. He shouting at in the bedroom just abuse
He said I had an ego because I couldn’t clear the plates after him and I was a little person who was always unhappy 
After a while.. I called him and said look can we talk about this i dont know why you’re so angry and he told me to fuck off and said he’s not gonna talk to me 
And then later.. I was in bed and he came in talking about how I’m never happy, I always make him feel bad and take his self esteem away. He said he dreads coming home to me and doesn’t wanna be with me anymore etc etc so I let him and speak and then when I tried to reply, he told me to Fuck off and shut the door on me

Can someone explain what the hell just happened? I have no idea what I did to deserve that.. I didn’t even raise my voice or swear back

He slept in the living room.. and when he woke up he was slamming doors while I was still sleeping, he left the living in such a state aswell.. empty coke bottles and glasses, his clothes dumped, the coffee table covered in crumbs and tobacco bits 

I called him and asked him he’s being so nasty, while he didn’t even clean up a bit ? And he just got super defensive again saying things that didn’t been make sense and then hung up on me..

We live in different city, we are both quarantining with our families and we are university students in a third city. I know that his father has been been physically violent with him all his life but he doesn't go home often because of that but now because of the virus he had to.

We were arguing literally all night on the phone about unimportant stuff and stress, suddenly around 7 a.m. he hangs up. He calls me again after like 10 minutes and says that his father burst in his room so he had to hang up. Okay, we continue talking we finally start to reach to an agreement about our fight when around 8 a.m. he hangs up again. This time he calls me around 30-40 minutes later, he is crying. I ask him what's wrong he tells me that his parents were fighting the first time his father came in the room he took his phone and throw it on the ground and left the room. Then my boyfriend called me again, and the second time he hang up, his father came into his room again and hit him with some object on his mouth and broke one of his lower teeth.

So my boyfriend is crying I ask him to please go to a dentist it might be serious, he tells me he won't he just needs to stop the bleeding. He says his father left and that he feels better now he just needs to stop the bleeding. He says he'll leave tomorrow back to the city where we study at, he just needs to find a place to live very quickly, and he tells me he'll report his father to the police. I get scared and tell him that maybe he should do that after he leaves so that his father won't be able to do anything to him, because in our country the police doesn't do shit about domestic violence cases.

He says he doesn't care anymore even if his father beats him up completely but he has to call the police, and that he'll do it later. We talk some more, I try to keep his mind off of it maybe I made a mistake there. He then tells me around 9:30 a.m. that he'll start studying I ask him if he's okay he says yes we'll talk later, and we hang up. I know I'm awful I didn't do anything.

Then I massage him around 10 a.m. asking him how he's feeling if his tooth hurts and if he stopped the bleeding, he doesn't reply but it says that he's online and the messages I send are being delivered. I call him he doesn't answer, I call him a lot of times he doesn't answer, I text him, I message him on facebook he doesn't answer. Around 40 minutes later he goes offline, and his phone is turned off. Now it's been 3 hours, I keep calling him every 10 minutes it's still off.

The 5 years has been full of lots of ups and downs. It started as mental and verbal abuse then turned into physical abuse once we moved into the house. I used to tell him he was the meanest person I’ve ever met and I’ve never cried so much in my life until I got with him. 

Over the years I stopped telling him about things going on with my family and friends because when I did he would twist things and use them against me. Example once he told me I was having an emotional affair with a male friend I worked with since I talked to him everyday. This everyday wasn’t recent and I saw him everyday AT WORK! That’s all he needed to accuse me. 

He was also very neglectful to me. I used to beg for him to call me and spend time with me. He would flip it around and accuse me of being neglectful when truthfully I contacted him more. Eventually I started doing that less and just hung with my friends or myself. I just started lowering my expectations so I would get less disappointed by him. He still found ways to disappoint me. 

He never hit me but he broke my things, held me up against the wall, used intimidation and threats against me (I could go on). I had my last straw 2 weeks ago when he broke 3 things of mine in a span of 3 days and made threats. So I left. I’m still in the process of getting him out of my home. I have a protection order against him. 

I was really sad and crying daily up until 2 days ago. I don’t feel sadness. Is something wrong with me? I wanted to marry this person and have a family with him at one point and time. We even were engaged (I ended it last year but we stayed together). I know grieving is supposed to take a while...surely longer than a week and a half. I feel like during the relationship I learned how to forgive him and get past things quickly in order to proceed with the relationship. How do I stop doing that so I can properly heal and grieve?

I had an abusive father for the first 15 years of my life. In his earlier days, my father would drink and smoke weed with his cousins, pop pills, dabbled in coke a little. But when he met my mom, he stopped doing everything else bc she told him what was good. After being together for about a year and a half, I come along. I didnt notice my father was abusive until I had to witnessed his drunken rage myself. I was diagnosed with PTSD, Major Depressive Disorder, and Severe Anxiety because of the shit I endured at my fathers residence. Im not going into this topic any further. 

So, my bf and I have been together for 6 months and its been wonderful. Hes the most thoughtful and caring person Ive met, hes always the first one to lend a hand and reach out to people when they need. Before our relationship, he was with this girl for 3 years and she was extremely abusive to him. She had Epilepsy and when they were together, my bf took care of her. She would fake seizures just to laugh in his face when he reacted and she hit him while he was driving. After they broke up he told his parents and friends about what was going on. 

Now his father doesn't like this Ex, understandable. But my bfs Mother has no problems with her.

Now the best way I can describe my bfs mom is she always thinks shes right and does nothing wrong, she can make fun of and tease everyone but cant take it back, she must be waited on hand and foot whether shes demanding coffee, more food, or for my bf or his dad to drop what they're doing to assist her. My bfs parents own a business and she controls all of the finances. Everything is in her name. She constantly holds each weeks paycheck over my bfs head and then BARELY pays her own husband what hes owed at the end of the week ( which would be abt $550 every week, but he gets $100 allowance instead). She's verbally abusive to my bf calling him the most degrading names, i dont understand how someone could could tell their son that he's worthless and doesn't deserve shit bc hes standing up for himself when all he's doing is his job. 

One of the most recent things that happened was as my bf was doing his task, his mom interviens and ends up fucking up some business orders. Somehow everyone starts yelling at my bf for being ""too sensitive"" and ""not taking a joke"" when he was actually being insulted. I stood up for him and said he was just doing his job and trying to help and i was met with ""you stay out of this, none of your business, you don't need to defend our son."" 

BUT IF I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO'S GOING TO DO IT YOU BET YOUR ASS IM GOING TO DEFEND HIM. 

Because of corona, we have to stay with this vindictive bitch and its bringing back a lot of past trauma. we cant work rn bc she doesn't want us to be exposed to too many ppl.


My point in making this post was to put out there that if you're in a similar situation, you aren't alone. i'm slowly losing myself but i'm hanging on in hope we can get to our safe haven.",domesticviolence,"I (F19) am living with my bf (M21) and his family during quarantine, but hes not the abusive one.",https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/gny7nv/i_f19_am_living_with_my_bf_m21_and_his_family/,True

So when lockdown was announced me (f22) and my boyfriend (m24) decided that I would spend it at his house where he lives with his mum and sister. His mum was fine with this as we get on well, his sisters boyfriend would also be staying and spending his days in the house as he and I both can’t work. My boyfriend and his sister are both essential workers. 

My boyfriends sister has never liked me and has previously informed my boyfriend ‘I’m not bothering with her because I tried with all the rest and they all go in the end’. So after that comment I’ve tried not to get in her way or join in too much in her conversation. 

About 2/3 weeks into lockdown it all kicked off, we were all in the kitchen at the time and my boyfriend was making general conversation that they were either ignoring or giving short answers too, he ended up asking his sister why we’d been blocked on all social media and what the problem was. Firstly they started saying to leave it alone and that she’s done with him, then she was shouting calling me a bitch and a cow, saying that I’m a creep because she can’t hear me coming down the stairs. 

As this was happening I was stood across the opposite side to them in the kitchen, stunned for words, his sister is 6ft so when she kicks off everyone’s frightened. Then she started to say I couldn’t speak for myself and I was stood there ‘like butter wouldn’t melt’ so I simply said to her ‘at least I’m not a (bad word)’like you. 

They both then barged past me through the door, she elbowed my arm then made a fist and punched the side of my face, I think if she’d hit my eye I definitely would’ve had a black eye. I was left holding my face in shock as they went upstairs and my boyfriend followed them up to defend me. 

Since then we were able to go to a family members house that was empty to quarantine together alone. The empty house now needs to be sold so we’re back living above his sister. The day before we came back she sent this text;

“Mum mentioned you and (my name) are coming back home, I’m sorry for what happened. Can we at least try and be civil whilst we are in lockdown together? Me and (her boyfriend) have been civil with mum, I hope we can do the same- without arguments. I hope you and (my name) are doing ok? And work has not been too stressful for you? Stay safe and see you soon. “

Tbh I just found this to be a further slap in the face, a half assed apology for ‘what happened’ not that she hit me? Not that she makes everyone so frightened we had to leave? My boyfriend ended up not replying as he didn’t want to rock the boat before we got back. It’s been six days now and we haven’t even crossed paths, I’m not looking forward to it. His sister is famous for not apologising and completely believes in herself, as well as her boyfriend who just goes along so he’s not in her war path. 

I’m not sure I can ever forgive her, and Id like to know what others would’ve done in mine and my boyfriends position? 

TL;DR! My boyfriends sister hit me, and we’ve come back after a month of living in a separate house to her pretending like it never happened with no real apology. I’m not sure I can ever forgive her.

I am not sure if this is the place I could post about my situation, because I have not really been the one that's gone through the physical abuse part, but I was a witness of it for a few years back when I was younger. I'm 20 now. When I was about 14, my dad started physically and emotionally abusing my mother, the emotional abuse had actually started way before that, but that's when it escalated to something else. 

I remember a lot of things very vividly. A lot of things I've heard that I should not have, I've seen a lot of things I shouldn't have. The abuse had started because my dad was a very jealous and possessive guy (what a surprise) and always had suspicions that my mom was cheating on him. So one day he brutally beats her up, parts of her hair were missing, she had a lot of bruises and was almost unrecognisable, avoiding to look at me. Many adults knew about the abuse from day 1 and no one offered a hand. I'm not saying I'm the victim here, obviously it's my mom that had it the worst. But it just breaks my heart and leaves me very conflicted about everything in my life. 

My father had been locking my mom, beating her, blackmailing her, throwing things at her, taking all her documents (because he was afraid she would run away or leave the country), he had made her write in a notebook about all her sexual encounters and then made her read it to us, while he would hit her after every sentence that he gets annoyed by. He threatened to cut her in parts and send her to her mom if she tries to run away or do anything without his permission. He drove all of us in a car while being completely drunk and hitting her while driving. 

I am COMPLETELY devastated and I really have no clue about what to do with myself. Not sure if therapy works, it always ends up being about me forgiving my father. And I am really not capable of that. I can't forgive a monster that ruined all of my family members' lives. I can't live with this.

I can't even fully have him out of my life, because they are still together (the physical abuse is not happening anymore), but I can't pretend to not remember anything and it's sort of made me get distanced from my mother as well. And I have so many things to tell her. That I've always been on her side, that I'll always protect her as much as I can and I want to say sorry for everything she's gone through. I'm also sorry if she sees him in me and that creates a bigger distance between us. But I understand it.

I left him about 2 weeks ago. It’s been draining for me and right now I don’t see the light at the end of the tunnel. I feel sick without him, like my chest caves in every time I think about the fact that we’re over. I’m in a really tough situation right now because I think that I may be pregnant. While I was with him he would sometimes either beat me until I almost blacked out or waited until I was sleep to have unprotected sex with me. A year ago when I secretly got on birth control that didn’t go well and he made me stop taking it. I ended up getting pregnant and I miscarried at 10 weeks. I didn’t know I was pregnant until I miscarries. Ever since then he would have unprotected sex with me while I was sleep or almost unconscious. It’s really weird and traumatizing having to wake up to that. 

I have not taken a pregnancy test but I am sure I’m most likely pregnant. I have already had an abortion when I was 16 on top of the miscarriage last year. I am a red to get another abortion. I feel like karma or something will happen in the future when I do want kids By the right person. I still love him but I know it’s dumb to have a kid by him right now. I feel like another abortion is gonna cause issues. 

I am currently at my moms house and I told her about me potentially being pregnant and she was upset and disappointed. She’s been basically ignoring me since I’ve been here and I am scared of how she’ll react if I tell her that I want an abortion. I feel like I sound like a little girl but I really would like the support of my mother during this time. She’s very judgemental when it comes to things like this. Plus I disobeyed her trying to and ran away with him when I turned 18 after dealing with him as a teen. She told me not to repeatedly but I didn’t listen. 

I feel like I put myself in a stupid situation. My mom says that if I don’t press charges on him while I still have “proof” (bruises, scars, etc.) then I will have to leave. I understand but I am just not ready to do that. I don’t want to press charges just yet. I’m not planning on going back to him but I’m not in the right headspace  to do all of this.

I just feel like this heartbreak won’t ever end. He’s called me numerous times and his last text said that he’ll give me my space but we’re goin got talk. I haven’t responded to him. I’m thinking about showing my mom that I haven’t spoken to him and that I’ll block his number. Just to give her some faith that I won’t go back and hopefully she’ll get off my back about making a report.

I don’t want to remember every detail, yet going to court has almost hammered this habit in to me where I must describe it all despite the amount of pain I was in.

I feel as though court itself can cause even more trauma. Having to be choked out by whatever spineless lawyer takes their case, defends them, and actively tries to attack you. This new behavior of recalling everything, dates, times, action and reactions has a play by play running through my head every evening until I cry and eventually fall asleep. Recollection I understand, but to have so much apprehension of events that haven’t happened yet? Even worse. “What if I have to court for xyz, what points do I make? I need to make a list of everything so I don’t miss anything like I did before.”

But the thing is... I’m not there anymore. I had gotten rid of my abuser in October. So why is it I can’t shake it now? Why do I dread going to sleep every night if the real nightmare is over?

I wonder, how would he respond if they met sooner and if he lived with her instead of me. Would she react differently to his temper tantrums? Would she calm him down in a way I can't? Would he take effort in not hurting her due to strong feelings of attachment, love and respect? How is this going? Do wrong people who stay together make each other worse and turn one another into violent assholes? Do right people uplift you and make you better and change your personality into something that's socially acceptable?

What can you say from your experience? Was your relationship steady and healthy, with respect and love in beginning? Did it have solid grounds?

Now he has violated it and the magistrate has formally charged him with a violation. This also violates his probation for his assault charge where he should be facing jail time.

1. Probation violation
2. Protective order violation

How likely is it he will face jail time? Court is next month (assuming he doesn’t push it back a couple months of course). I can’t bring myself to go but since the magistrate is charging and there are already three witness statements (me, someone with me, and the owner of the location who asked him to leave and he refused) I don’t think I will need to go and it isn’t worth the added trauma.

She's generally sweet and our relationship is fairly good. She has had some unfortunate relationships in the past, including one that was emotionally abusive and the guy even hit her in the face in front of her family.. Having said that, there have been a couple instances that make me anxious and I'm unsure of how to proceed. 

Instance 1 - We had a group of friends come over and she get incredibly drunk and blacked out part of the night. She was incredibly emotional and at multiple times told her best friend she doesn't think I care about her while I was standing 6 feet away each time. I had even invited her best friend over because of how sad she (my gf) was feeling that her friend wasn't there. There were some other inappropriate things that night and I told her that I wasn't comfortable with that. The next morning I told her that I wanted her to go back to therapy.

Instance 2 - After a night of drinking, we facetimed her best friend as we were closed to going to bed. During the conversation I made an off-hand reference to my gf's ex about how I didn't remember his name because I had been drunk when I met him. My girlfriend's face turned incredibly angry and she tried to choke me with one hand, and when I took her hand off my neck she tried with the next hand. This was while her friend was on the phone. She hung up shortly after. I told my girlfriend that if she ever did that again that we were done. She said it happened because her ex's name triggered a bunch of her past memories, but that she wasn't trying to make that an excuse for what happened.  She still slept over that night because I couldn't bring myself to tell her to leave...

Instance 3 - We went to a friend's house and the night was going great. At a certain point were were sort of alone and she had her hand around my neck, which in a normal world I don't see that as a bad thing (just like a normal hands on the head / neck which would be comforting in some situations). But she went ahead and applied a little bit of pressure all the while having a really jokey face. I told her to not do that ever and she said she was sorry and I don't really remember the rest of the conversation because I was upset and drunk. She did say she wouldn't do it again.

I'm a guy and I feel incredibly weird about this. When I told my best friend this he said he was scared for me. I don't really feel 'scared' physically, but I do feel anxious just because I don't know how much of her reaction of going to therapy or saying that she won't do that again is truly real. It complicates things more when we both share the same friends from before we were together.  I've talked to my therapist about this but it doesn't feel like it's helping. I apologize if this is sort of scattered. 

tl;dr my girlfriend choked me briefly because i made an off-hand comment about an ex. she has apologized and is going to therapy but I feel incredibly weird about this.",domesticviolence,Not entirely sure what to do,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/gmxevq/not_entirely_sure_what_to_do/,True

There a three sides to every story so I’ll try my best to make sure I state everything. Usually an argument starts about something stupid like why I opened the curtains when he just closed them even tho I didn’t know that. I told him that I just wanted some sunshine and I opened the curtains. He told me that I was being defiant and not obeying him like I said I would during our marriage vows. I apologized and said that I didn’t know he had just closed the curtains. That went on for about 10 minutes. I walked away and went to bed to cool off as I couldn’t handle the conversation of me being disobedient cuz I really didn’t think that I was and I was really going to lay into him about the whole “I shall obey my husband” speech. I k we better than to get started on that conversation. He came up to see me about 10 minutes later and laid on the bed with me. He started to talk calmly about it with me and then started with how disobedient I am and how defiant I am towards him all the time. He starting laying I. To me about it and was really pushing my buttons to the point I was seeing red and was going to punch him. I started to feel threatened and really angry so I kicked his leg to push him out of my way. It was not hard but I still kicked him. He then grabbed me by my hair, lifted me off there best and threw me face down in to the bed. He had my arm behind my back and was pulling my hair so hard that my neck was bending towards my back.  I could feel the muscles pulling in my back. I told him he was being an asshole and I didn’t care that he thought I was disobedient or defiant and that he could f himself. I couldn’t move or do anything to physically get out of the situation. He made me repeat what I said and if I didn’t he would pull harder on my arm and my hair. So I said it. He then flipped me over on to my back and was sitting on top of me. He had his hands around my throat and his knees on my arms. He had my legs pinned under his somehow. I couldn’t move. He looked at me and told me he was going to rape me and that I would probably like it. I started crying and he got off of me and let me go. I started to walk away and then he starts telling me again what a disobedient bitch I am and that I broke my promise to God. I got in his face and told him he was a dick and he can go f himself.

I have a temper and I know I do and being enraged when I can’t get my words out is a very volatile situation for me.

I’m currently quarantining with my family, back and forth between the Bay Area and San Diego. My apartment is likely going to be empty until WFH is over. 

A bit about the apartment - it’s located in Koreatown and is about 680 square feet. No roommates. Full bathroom with bathtub, kitchen, washing machine, dryer, dishwasher, TV, WiFi, balcony. I also have some food in the freezer which I can leave for you to use. Just take care of my plants &lt;3 

If you’re interested please send me a PM. I’m a lawyer and I can write us up a contract. I really want to use this empty space to help someone who needs it.

EDIT with more info: there’s also an assigned parking space, pets are allowed with a deposit (the apartment complex imposes the deposit not me), and it’s close to a lot of grocery stores! I’ll be leaving all of my cookware, furniture, and cleaning supplies for you to use. 

I’d really love to help someone out so rent &amp; time period would be negotiable~ 
I’ll be away for at least the summer.

We’ve been having issues for a while now, but we decided to be civil with each other and live together until the end of July or until one of us can find a new place. He said he would help me with moving and that maybe we could try to see where life takes us once we move into different locations. 
This morning my entire perspective on our situation changed. We have a cat that I adopted when we were together, however I adopted her under my name and she’s legally my cat because he wasn’t at the shelter when I adopted her. We already agreed that she is mine and is going to live with me after all this stuff was said and done. She usually meows early in the morning to play or for food. This morning he lost his shit. Picked her up and threw her onto the bed and then tried smothering her with a pillow. I screamed at him and told him if he did it again I was calling the police. He responded by saying I was being dramatic and to stop crying. (He often gaslights me during our conversations)
I was so freaked out that I ended up bringing her to work with me because he’s currently working from home remotely during this while I still have to go in. Luckily my bosses were super chill and understanding. I just didn’t want to leave her alone with him for the fear that he might hurt her. When I was leaving he was like “I’m not gonna fuckin kill her”  
While this is the first time he’s done something to her it isn’t the first time he’s been violent. There’s been many times where he would grab my wrists or my legs to the point of bruising. He’s also sexually assaulted me multiple times throughout our relationship. 
I’m planning on moving out ASAP and already have things set up, but I still have to wait a few weeks. I started packing as soon as I got back today so I can leave as soon as I can get into my new place.

I asked him cheekily if he’s so grateful maybe he could give me a hand clearing up? And he said he didn’t wanna get up so soon after eating and I was like okay sure I understand.
I took the plates into the kitchen and a few mins later he came into the kitchen too I didn’t see what he did though coz I had my back to him.
I honestly thought he was gonna help me tidy up a bit.. but then he sat back down and when I turned looked he was sitting there rolling up a smoke while I tidied up. 
I sat back down in the living and I felt a bit down coz I guess I was left to tidy up while he was rolling a smoke?!
Anyway I didn’t say anything and he asked what was wrong so I said it would’ve been nice if you helped tidy up a bit while you were up anyway and he got super defensive so I just said okay cool and just left it alone and watched tv
And then he asked why I was so closed off and I’m like what dyu mean, and he just started ranting at me? 
He got seriously angry and started calling me a motherfucker, a cunt, he got up and went to the bedroom and slammed the door. He shouting at in the bedroom just abuse
He said I had an ego because I couldn’t clear the plates after him and I was a little person who was always unhappy 
After a while.. I called him and said look can we talk about this i dont know why you’re so angry and he told me to fuck off and said he’s not gonna talk to me

He said he dreads coming home to me and doesn’t wanna be with me anymore etc etc so I let him and speak and then when I tried to reply, he told me to Fuck off and shut the door on me

Can someone explain what the hell just happened? I have no idea what I did to deserve that.. I didn’t even raise my voice or swear back

He slept in the living room.. and when he woke up he was slamming doors while I was still sleeping, he left the living in such a state aswell.. empty coke bottles and glasses, his clothes dumped, the coffee table covered in crumbs and tobacco bits 

I called him and asked him he’s being so nasty, while he didn’t even clean up a bit ? And he just got super defensive again saying things that didn’t been make sense and then hung up on me..

We live in different city, we are both quarantining with our families and we are university students in a third city. I know that his father has been been physically violent with him all his life but he doesn't go home often because of that but now because of the virus he had to.

We were arguing literally all night on the phone about unimportant stuff and stress, suddenly around 7 a.m. he hangs up. He calls me again after like 10 minutes and says that his father burst in his room so he had to hang up. Okay, we continue talking we finally start to reach to an agreement about our fight when around 8 a.m. he hangs up again. This time he calls me around 30-40 minutes later, he is crying. I ask him what's wrong he tells me that his parents were fighting the first time his father came in the room he took his phone and throw it on the ground and left the room. Then my boyfriend called me again, and the second time he hang up, his father came into his room again and hit him with some object on his mouth and broke one of his lower teeth.

So my boyfriend is crying I ask him to please go to a dentist it might be serious, he tells me he won't he just needs to stop the bleeding. He says his father left and that he feels better now he just needs to stop the bleeding. He says he'll leave tomorrow back to the city where we study at, he just needs to find a place to live very quickly, and he tells me he'll report his father to the police. I get scared and tell him that maybe he should do that after he leaves so that his father won't be able to do anything to him, because in our country the police doesn't do shit about domestic violence cases.

He says he doesn't care anymore even if his father beats him up completely but he has to call the police, and that he'll do it later. We talk some more, I try to keep his mind off of it maybe I made a mistake there. He then tells me around 9:30 a.m. that he'll start studying I ask him if he's okay he says yes we'll talk later, and we hang up. I know I'm awful I didn't do anything.

Then I massage him around 10 a.m. asking him how he's feeling if his tooth hurts and if he stopped the bleeding, he doesn't reply but it says that he's online and the messages I send are being delivered. I call him he doesn't answer, I call him a lot of times he doesn't answer, I text him, I message him on facebook he doesn't answer. Around 40 minutes later he goes offline, and his phone is turned off. Now it's been 3 hours, I keep calling him every 10 minutes it's still off.

The 5 years has been full of lots of ups and downs. It started as mental and verbal abuse then turned into physical abuse once we moved into the house. I used to tell him he was the meanest person I’ve ever met and I’ve never cried so much in my life until I got with him. 

Over the years I stopped telling him about things going on with my family and friends because when I did he would twist things and use them against me. Example once he told me I was having an emotional affair with a male friend I worked with since I talked to him everyday. This everyday wasn’t recent and I saw him everyday AT WORK! That’s all he needed to accuse me. 

He was also very neglectful to me. I used to beg for him to call me and spend time with me. He would flip it around and accuse me of being neglectful when truthfully I contacted him more. Eventually I started doing that less and just hung with my friends or myself. I just started lowering my expectations so I would get less disappointed by him. He still found ways to disappoint me. 

He never hit me but he broke my things, held me up against the wall, used intimidation and threats against me (I could go on). I had my last straw 2 weeks ago when he broke 3 things of mine in a span of 3 days and made threats. So I left. I’m still in the process of getting him out of my home. I have a protection order against him. 

I was really sad and crying daily up until 2 days ago. I don’t feel sadness. Is something wrong with me? I wanted to marry this person and have a family with him at one point and time. We even were engaged (I ended it last year but we stayed together). I know grieving is supposed to take a while...surely longer than a week and a half. I feel like during the relationship I learned how to forgive him and get past things quickly in order to proceed with the relationship. How do I stop doing that so I can properly heal and grieve? 

We have “broken up” ( I break up with him he doesn’t accept it so we stay together) with him many times over the years.

I had an abusive father for the first 15 years of my life. In his earlier days, my father would drink and smoke weed with his cousins, pop pills, dabbled in coke a little. But when he met my mom, he stopped doing everything else bc she told him what was good. After being together for about a year and a half, I come along. I didnt notice my father was abusive until I had to witnessed his drunken rage myself. I was diagnosed with PTSD, Major Depressive Disorder, and Severe Anxiety because of the shit I endured at my fathers residence. Im not going into this topic any further. 

So, my bf and I have been together for 6 months and its been wonderful. Hes the most thoughtful and caring person Ive met, hes always the first one to lend a hand and reach out to people when they need. Before our relationship, he was with this girl for 3 years and she was extremely abusive to him. She had Epilepsy and when they were together, my bf took care of her. She would fake seizures just to laugh in his face when he reacted and she hit him while he was driving. After they broke up he told his parents and friends about what was going on. 

Now his father doesn't like this Ex, understandable. But my bfs Mother has no problems with her.

Now the best way I can describe my bfs mom is she always thinks shes right and does nothing wrong, she can make fun of and tease everyone but cant take it back, she must be waited on hand and foot whether shes demanding coffee, more food, or for my bf or his dad to drop what they're doing to assist her. My bfs parents own a business and she controls all of the finances. Everything is in her name. She constantly holds each weeks paycheck over my bfs head and then BARELY pays her own husband what hes owed at the end of the week ( which would be abt $550 every week, but he gets $100 allowance instead). She's verbally abusive to my bf calling him the most degrading names, i dont understand how someone could could tell their son that he's worthless and doesn't deserve shit bc hes standing up for himself when all he's doing is his job. 

One of the most recent things that happened was as my bf was doing his task, his mom interviens and ends up fucking up some business orders. Somehow everyone starts yelling at my bf for being ""too sensitive"" and ""not taking a joke"" when he was actually being insulted. I stood up for him and said he was just doing his job and trying to help and i was met with ""you stay out of this, none of your business, you don't need to defend our son."" 

BUT IF I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO'S GOING TO DO IT YOU BET YOUR ASS IM GOING TO DEFEND HIM. 

Because of corona, we have to stay with this vindictive bitch and its bringing back a lot of past trauma. we cant work rn bc she doesn't want us to be exposed to too many ppl.


My point in making this post was to put out there that if you're in a similar situation, you aren't alone. i'm slowly losing myself but i'm hanging on in hope we can get to our safe haven.",domesticviolence,"I (F19) am living with my bf (M21) and his family during quarantine, but hes not the abusive one.",https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/gny7nv/i_f19_am_living_with_my_bf_m21_and_his_family/,True

So when lockdown was announced me (f22) and my boyfriend (m24) decided that I would spend it at his house where he lives with his mum and sister. His mum was fine with this as we get on well, his sisters boyfriend would also be staying and spending his days in the house as he and I both can’t work. My boyfriend and his sister are both essential workers. 

My boyfriends sister has never liked me and has previously informed my boyfriend ‘I’m not bothering with her because I tried with all the rest and they all go in the end’. So after that comment I’ve tried not to get in her way or join in too much in her conversation. 

About 2/3 weeks into lockdown it all kicked off, we were all in the kitchen at the time and my boyfriend was making general conversation that they were either ignoring or giving short answers too, he ended up asking his sister why we’d been blocked on all social media and what the problem was. Firstly they started saying to leave it alone and that she’s done with him, then she was shouting calling me a bitch and a cow, saying that I’m a creep because she can’t hear me coming down the stairs. 

As this was happening I was stood across the opposite side to them in the kitchen, stunned for words, his sister is 6ft so when she kicks off everyone’s frightened. Then she started to say I couldn’t speak for myself and I was stood there ‘like butter wouldn’t melt’ so I simply said to her ‘at least I’m not a (bad word)’like you. 

They both then barged past me through the door, she elbowed my arm then made a fist and punched the side of my face, I think if she’d hit my eye I definitely would’ve had a black eye. I was left holding my face in shock as they went upstairs and my boyfriend followed them up to defend me. 

Since then we were able to go to a family members house that was empty to quarantine together alone. The empty house now needs to be sold so we’re back living above his sister. The day before we came back she sent this text;

“Mum mentioned you and (my name) are coming back home, I’m sorry for what happened. Can we at least try and be civil whilst we are in lockdown together? Me and (her boyfriend) have been civil with mum, I hope we can do the same- without arguments. I hope you and (my name) are doing ok? And work has not been too stressful for you? Stay safe and see you soon. “

Tbh I just found this to be a further slap in the face, a half assed apology for ‘what happened’ not that she hit me? Not that she makes everyone so frightened we had to leave? My boyfriend ended up not replying as he didn’t want to rock the boat before we got back. It’s been six days now and we haven’t even crossed paths, I’m not looking forward to it. His sister is famous for not apologising and completely believes in herself, as well as her boyfriend who just goes along so he’s not in her war path. 

I’m not sure I can ever forgive her, and Id like to know what others would’ve done in mine and my boyfriends position? 

TL;DR! My boyfriends sister hit me, and we’ve come back after a month of living in a separate house to her pretending like it never happened with no real apology. I’m not sure I can ever forgive her.

I am not sure if this is the place I could post about my situation, because I have not really been the one that's gone through the physical abuse part, but I was a witness of it for a few years back when I was younger. I'm 20 now. When I was about 14, my dad started physically and emotionally abusing my mother, the emotional abuse had actually started way before that, but that's when it escalated to something else. 

I remember a lot of things very vividly. A lot of things I've heard that I should not have, I've seen a lot of things I shouldn't have. The abuse had started because my dad was a very jealous and possessive guy (what a surprise) and always had suspicions that my mom was cheating on him. So one day he brutally beats her up, parts of her hair were missing, she had a lot of bruises and was almost unrecognisable, avoiding to look at me. Many adults knew about the abuse from day 1 and no one offered a hand. I'm not saying I'm the victim here, obviously it's my mom that had it the worst. But it just breaks my heart and leaves me very conflicted about everything in my life. 

My father had been locking my mom, beating her, blackmailing her, throwing things at her, taking all her documents (because he was afraid she would run away or leave the country), he had made her write in a notebook about all her sexual encounters and then made her read it to us, while he would hit her after every sentence that he gets annoyed by. He threatened to cut her in parts and send her to her mom if she tries to run away or do anything without his permission. He drove all of us in a car while being completely drunk and hitting her while driving. 

I am COMPLETELY devastated and I really have no clue about what to do with myself. Not sure if therapy works, it always ends up being about me forgiving my father. And I am really not capable of that. I can't forgive a monster that ruined all of my family members' lives. I can't live with this.

I can't even fully have him out of my life, because they are still together (the physical abuse is not happening anymore), but I can't pretend to not remember anything and it's sort of made me get distanced from my mother as well. And I have so many things to tell her. That I've always been on her side, that I'll always protect her as much as I can and I want to say sorry for everything she's gone through. I'm also sorry if she sees him in me and that creates a bigger distance between us. But I understand it.

I left him about 2 weeks ago. It’s been draining for me and right now I don’t see the light at the end of the tunnel. I feel sick without him, like my chest caves in every time I think about the fact that we’re over. I’m in a really tough situation right now because I think that I may be pregnant. While I was with him he would sometimes either beat me until I almost blacked out or waited until I was sleep to have unprotected sex with me. A year ago when I secretly got on birth control that didn’t go well and he made me stop taking it. I ended up getting pregnant and I miscarried at 10 weeks. I didn’t know I was pregnant until I miscarries. Ever since then he would have unprotected sex with me while I was sleep or almost unconscious. It’s really weird and traumatizing having to wake up to that. 

I have not taken a pregnancy test but I am sure I’m most likely pregnant. I have already had an abortion when I was 16 on top of the miscarriage last year. I am a red to get another abortion. I feel like karma or something will happen in the future when I do want kids By the right person. I still love him but I know it’s dumb to have a kid by him right now. I feel like another abortion is gonna cause issues. 

I am currently at my moms house and I told her about me potentially being pregnant and she was upset and disappointed. She’s been basically ignoring me since I’ve been here and I am scared of how she’ll react if I tell her that I want an abortion. I feel like I sound like a little girl but I really would like the support of my mother during this time. She’s very judgemental when it comes to things like this. Plus I disobeyed her trying to and ran away with him when I turned 18 after dealing with him as a teen. She told me not to repeatedly but I didn’t listen. 

I feel like I put myself in a stupid situation. My mom says that if I don’t press charges on him while I still have “proof” (bruises, scars, etc.) then I will have to leave. I understand but I am just not ready to do that. I don’t want to press charges just yet. I’m not planning on going back to him but I’m not in the right headspace  to do all of this.

I just feel like this heartbreak won’t ever end. He’s called me numerous times and his last text said that he’ll give me my space but we’re goin got talk. I haven’t responded to him. I’m thinking about showing my mom that I haven’t spoken to him and that I’ll block his number. Just to give her some faith that I won’t go back and hopefully she’ll get off my back about making a report.

Backstory is...my husband and I only got married 5 months ago (but together for 8 years). I can say there has been emotional abuse along the way. He is the king of the silent treatment (weeks). 

I have a quick temper that I work on but sometimes I regress. One such time was 3 weeks ago. Husband carries a lot of anger because he hated his job. He likes to take it out on me by nitpicking. On this occasion I snapped a little, grabbed his arm and angrily told him to give it a rest. 
Totally immediately apologized for grabbing him and meant it. Mind you nothing close to this has happened before, my temper is quick, verbal, and fleeting. He said never do it again, said I won't and again, so so sorry. 

He retreats to basement and since we have different schedules, it is easy to avoid each other. I genuinely feel bad, I write him notes, bake him lots of things, send him emails. Nothing.

Slams door. Not a minute later, comes back, spits in my face and again says he wants a divorce. Minutes later comes back once more, chokes me, hits me in the face, and then punches and breaks my mirror. 

Now I know I started this, but I don't understand what makes someone that took 3 weeks to think about it go into a sudden rampage. Aside from the occasional play fight where he got a little overzealous he has never hit me before. He could have asked for a divorce without all of this. 

I left and stayed with someone because I was scared. But I know we have to talk even if it is just talking terms of getting out of this marriage. So I'm back home now and he will be home in about 2 hours. I'm waiting up so we can talk when he gets home. But I'm terrified right now. I can't just move out, I work from home.

We rarely argue or fight but when we do, it’s pretty heated.  Well, last month, he became violent for the first time ever. 

He’s intensely stressed out with Covid as he’s a frontline physician in the hospital. He also has PTSD from the of death of his parents at a young age and they were alcoholics and fought all the time. So he gets anxious and panicky over the thought of loosing his family (I know no excuse) and that’s what he’s been most worried over with the pandemic is getting sick and dying or bringing it home to us and we get sick and die.

Anyway- during the fight he was screaming in my face that I’m a dumb bitch and stupid because I wasted $3 on the kids on Easter grass when we already had Easter grass and there’s millions of people without work, going to drive up food banks. He told me we had some and when I went out to get the Easter goodies, I bought it because I didn’t see any in the Easter box in storage. He admitted it wasn’t about the $3 grass but that I didn’t listen to him. I told him he was being abusive and needs to stop calling me names but he kept ranting. He finally got in my face with his finger pointing in my face swearing and yelling. I hit his hand away with my left hand (I’m right handed) and he ended up grabbing me by the hair and throwing me down and shaking me up and down  and threatened to kill me.  I know I should have walked away to my room but I didn’t.  The next day, I went to the ED to get X-rays because my clavicle hurt and I was concerned it might be broken. I had to drive out of state to get to a hospital that my health insurance would cover and that wasn’t his work place. I had bruises on me for 10 days after on my arms and fingers. 

He’s never made a threat to hurt me beyond threats to divorce me. He’s called me names before..maybe 3x since I’ve ever known him and it never happened before we got married. I know I wouldn’t have married him if he had. My mother left my dad when I was 1.5 years old because he became violent with her so she raised me to not accept anything like that. I never been in a physically violent relationship before. 

I don’t trust him anymore. I don’t want to live a life walking on egg shells. I don’t see a lot changing.  He’s in a stressful job that he dislikes. He’s not hit the kids but he’s threatened our son and has gotten in his face threatening to knock his lights out to get him to do what he wants or to punish or scare him. Anyway—- does this sound like escalating abuse?

I keep researching  for stats on repeat offending because I suspect once someone crosses that line, it’s hard to not do it again. I realize it’s very much about being in control of us and he probably thinks he’s being protective of us. His friends have died or diagnosed with cancer etc and as we age, it’s just going to keep happening with the loss of friends etc and sensing our own mortality. I  don’t know if I can trust him ever again to be able to handle stress without getting so angry and violent. 

I don’t think he will harm me any time right now. But I’ve started to take precautions just in case I need to leave quickly. I have a bag packed and in the car and the kids clothes packed. I changed my password in my phone. We long have had separate bank accounts.I have cash in a locked cabinet in my private office at work. So I think I’m good there. 

He tells me that he started to go to therapy at my insistence and I saw the insurance copay bill come in the mail so I know he attended an appt (TeleHealth) with the therapist at least once since then. But what’s the chances of him never doing this again? 

When he let go of me, he said “how many times have you hit me?” Which was totally to gaslight me. I’ve never hit him before and he’s apparently taking me batting his hand out of my face as hitting him which is both concerning and manipulative when he was being aggressive.   The other thing that was concerning is when I asked him how his therapy session go and what did the therapist say, he responded with “he acted like it was the 20th tome he heard my story today”. I felt like he was trying to normalize and justify becoming abusive. 

So my questions are: 
(1) does this sound like the pattern or escalating abuse? 
(2) what are the chances of someone becoming physically violent again? I know this is a national emergency but still...",domesticviolence,First time,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/gmi91b/first_time/,True

I meant Jon 6 months ago and immediately fell in love. Soulmate status. I felt like I had finally found my forever person. 
We had only been dating two months when this pandemic hit. Due to our seasonal life, we both lost our jobs, and Jon lost his housing. Things were going well between us, so I told him just to move in with me. 

About a week later, Jons best friend committed suicide. This was hard for both of us, but especially hard for him. Jon has bipolar disorder and spiraled. It got to the point where I had to bring him to the ER and he was put on a psych hold for three days. 

When he came back, he still wouldn’t really talk about his friend, but said he didn’t want to drink anymore because it makes him too sad. We were sober for about a week before he said he wanted to have some beers. We both got drunk, and he started crying, and when I was trying to console him I said “this is something that you’ll eventually move on from”, and he got mad. Like, really mad. He got physically violent with me. I vented to some friends about it, and one of the friends told my little brother who told me to leave. I didn’t want to, because I knew just how much shit Jon was going through at the time and I forgave him. 

Flash forward to a few days ago. It’s been MONTHS of quarantine and we finally have an opportunity to get back to work, but we have to move. So on the move, we stop at his friends bar along the way. I got drunk. Jealous about his female friend telling me all about how they used to pretend to date so they could have housing together. And I went to the car packed with all of our stuff and tried to drive away. Jon tried to grab my keys but in my drunken rage I hit him, so he choked me. I screamed, the cops came to the bar, and I asked them to separate us for the night because I was drunk and angry. 

I called my mom and told her about it. And about the first time. I told her how angry I was, how I wasn’t sure I wanted to be with someone who would do that to me, and she agreed. 
Jon and I met for breakfast the next morning and talked through things, we both apologized for our overreactions, and continued the move to our new job. 
We get to the job and it is beautiful. And we would finally have an income, some purpose in the days, a beautiful property, and free housing and food. 

I got there, and I found out that my mom was sending my brother on a 12 hour drive to come get me, and that if I didn’t leave the job that day she was going to send family friends in the area to come get me “away from Jon”. And if I didn’t leave, she would call my employer and tell them everything. 
To stop any huge scene from happening, Jon and I unpacked our belongings and moved him in, and put all of my things back in the car and I had to drive away and leave the job and my boyfriend. 

She is making me come home, which is 2,500 miles away, and go to counseling because she thinks I’ve been brainwashed into staying in this relationship with someone who she views as some manipulative abuser. 

This is because I drunkenly called and vented to my mom. I no longer have a choice on where I can work, live, or do with my life, because she threatened Jons life and livelihood. 

How the hell can I convince my mother to let me stay on the west coast with him at the job I want to be working when she just thinks I’ve been being abused? 

I drove two hours away and spent the night in a hotel or my brother was going to keep driving through the night to ‘get’ me. 

TL;DR - Boyfriend and I had a physical altercation, and my mother gave me no choice but to drive 2,500 miles or she would ruin the life of my boyfriend. I don’t want to leave. It all feels like a gross overreaction.",domesticviolence,"My mom is forcing me (24f) to leave my job, home, and boyfriend (25m).",https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/gmp77l/my_mom_is_forcing_me_24f_to_leave_my_job_home_and/,True

She's generally sweet and our relationship is fairly good. She has had some unfortunate relationships in the past, including one that was emotionally abusive and the guy even hit her in the face in front of her family.. Having said that, there have been a couple instances that make me anxious and I'm unsure of how to proceed. 

Instance 1 - We had a group of friends come over and she get incredibly drunk and blacked out part of the night. She was incredibly emotional and at multiple times told her best friend she doesn't think I care about her while I was standing 6 feet away each time. I had even invited her best friend over because of how sad she (my gf) was feeling that her friend wasn't there. There were some other inappropriate things that night and I told her that I wasn't comfortable with that. The next morning I told her that I wanted her to go back to therapy.

Instance 2 - After a night of drinking, we facetimed her best friend as we were closed to going to bed. During the conversation I made an off-hand reference to my gf's ex about how I didn't remember his name because I had been drunk when I met him. My girlfriend's face turned incredibly angry and she tried to choke me with one hand, and when I took her hand off my neck she tried with the next hand. This was while her friend was on the phone. She hung up shortly after. I told my girlfriend that if she ever did that again that we were done. She said it happened because her ex's name triggered a bunch of her past memories, but that she wasn't trying to make that an excuse for what happened.  She still slept over that night because I couldn't bring myself to tell her to leave...

Instance 3 - We went to a friend's house and the night was going great. At a certain point were were sort of alone and she had her hand around my neck, which in a normal world I don't see that as a bad thing (just like a normal hands on the head / neck which would be comforting in some situations). But she went ahead and applied a little bit of pressure all the while having a really jokey face. I told her to not do that ever and she said she was sorry and I don't really remember the rest of the conversation because I was upset and drunk. She did say she wouldn't do it again.

I'm a guy and I feel incredibly weird about this. When I told my best friend this he said he was scared for me. I don't really feel 'scared' physically, but I do feel anxious just because I don't know how much of her reaction of going to therapy or saying that she won't do that again is truly real. It complicates things more when we both share the same friends from before we were together.  I've talked to my therapist about this but it doesn't feel like it's helping. I apologize if this is sort of scattered. 

tl;dr my girlfriend choked me briefly because i made an off-hand comment about an ex. she has apologized and is going to therapy but I feel incredibly weird about this.",domesticviolence,Not entirely sure what to do,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/gmxevq/not_entirely_sure_what_to_do/,True

We have been together for 27 years. There has been some historical violence in our past and usually occurs just a few times a year. I’m not sure if it’s my fault. There a three sides to every story so I’ll try my best to make sure I state everything. Usually an argument starts about something stupid like why I opened the curtains when he just closed them even tho I didn’t know that. I told him that I just wanted some sunshine and I opened the curtains. He told me that I was being defiant and not obeying him like I said I would during our marriage vows. I apologized and said that I didn’t know he had just closed the curtains. That went on for about 10 minutes. I walked away and went to bed to cool off as I couldn’t handle the conversation of me being disobedient cuz I really didn’t think that I was and I was really going to lay into him about the whole “I shall obey my husband” speech. I k we better than to get started on that conversation. He came up to see me about 10 minutes later and laid on the bed with me. He started to talk calmly about it with me and then started with how disobedient I am and how defiant I am towards him all the time. He starting laying I. To me about it and was really pushing my buttons to the point I was seeing red and was going to punch him. I started to feel threatened and really angry so I kicked his leg to push him out of my way. It was not hard but I still kicked him. He then grabbed me by my hair, lifted me off there best and threw me face down in to the bed. He had my arm behind my back and was pulling my hair so hard that my neck was bending towards my back.  I could feel the muscles pulling in my back. I told him he was being an asshole and I didn’t care that he thought I was disobedient or defiant and that he could f himself. I couldn’t move or do anything to physically get out of the situation. He made me repeat what I said and if I didn’t he would pull harder on my arm and my hair. So I said it. He then flipped me over on to my back and was sitting on top of me. He had his hands around my throat and his knees on my arms. He had my legs pinned under his somehow. I couldn’t move. He looked at me and told me he was going to rape me and that I would probably like it. I started crying and he got off of me and let me go. I started to walk away and then he starts telling me again what a disobedient bitch I am and that I broke my promise to God. I got in his face and told him he was a dick and he can go f himself. He started yelling at me some more so I slapped him. He then started choking me and threw me on the floor. Eventually I just lay there and let him continue as in the past it always made him ease up. He did and let me go. I left the room and went to another room. He came to see me and started talking with me. Asking me why I keep letting this happen to us. I don’t know why I do. I don’t know I started the argument. I shouldn’t have kicked him. I should have used my words like a normal person. I have a temper and I know I do and being enraged when I can’t get my words out is a very volatile situation for me. I tried my best to calm the situation but it seemed that he was trying to get me mad on purpose. He would ask me questions and I give him my honest answer and it never matters what I say, it’s wrong and I am being defiant. I guess I’m just frustrated with never being able to give a right answer to him to make him happy. Is this all my fault?

I’m currently quarantining with my family, back and forth between the Bay Area and San Diego. My apartment is likely going to be empty until WFH is over. 

A bit about the apartment - it’s located in Koreatown and is about 680 square feet. No roommates. Full bathroom with bathtub, kitchen, washing machine, dryer, dishwasher, TV, WiFi, balcony. I also have some food in the freezer which I can leave for you to use. Just take care of my plants &lt;3 

If you’re interested please send me a PM. I’m a lawyer and I can write us up a contract. I really want to use this empty space to help someone who needs it.

EDIT with more info: there’s also an assigned parking space, pets are allowed with a deposit (the apartment complex imposes the deposit not me), and it’s close to a lot of grocery stores! I’ll be leaving all of my cookware, furniture, and cleaning supplies for you to use. 

I’d really love to help someone out so rent &amp; time period would be negotiable~

We’ve been having issues for a while now, but we decided to be civil with each other and live together until the end of July or until one of us can find a new place. He said he would help me with moving and that maybe we could try to see where life takes us once we move into different locations. 
This morning my entire perspective on our situation changed. We have a cat that I adopted when we were together, however I adopted her under my name and she’s legally my cat because he wasn’t at the shelter when I adopted her. We already agreed that she is mine and is going to live with me after all this stuff was said and done. She usually meows early in the morning to play or for food. This morning he lost his shit. Picked her up and threw her onto the bed and then tried smothering her with a pillow. I screamed at him and told him if he did it again I was calling the police. He responded by saying I was being dramatic and to stop crying. (He often gaslights me during our conversations)
I was so freaked out that I ended up bringing her to work with me because he’s currently working from home remotely during this while I still have to go in. Luckily my bosses were super chill and understanding. I just didn’t want to leave her alone with him for the fear that he might hurt her.

So yesterday, I (f29) made dinner for my partner (m29). I worked the night shift and gotten a few hours of sleep through the day so I was pretty tired by dinner time. 
He got home, after going work and then hanging out with his brother. We had dinner and I got up to clear the plates. He said thank you multiple times and dinner was very nice.
I asked him cheekily if he’s so grateful maybe he could give me a hand clearing up? And he said he didn’t wanna get up so soon after eating and I was like okay sure I understand.
I took the plates into the kitchen and a few mins later he came into the kitchen too I didn’t see what he did though coz I had my back to him.
I honestly thought he was gonna help me tidy up a bit.. but then he sat back down and when I turned looked he was sitting there rolling up a smoke while I tidied up. 
I sat back down in the living and I felt a bit down coz I guess I was left to tidy up while he was rolling a smoke?!
Anyway I didn’t say anything and he asked what was wrong so I said it would’ve been nice if you helped tidy up a bit while you were up anyway and he got super defensive so I just said okay cool and just left it alone and watched tv
And then he asked why I was so closed off and I’m like what dyu mean, and he just started ranting at me? 
He got seriously angry and started calling me a motherfucker, a cunt, he got up and went to the bedroom and slammed the door. He shouting at in the bedroom just abuse
He said I had an ego because I couldn’t clear the plates after him and I was a little person who was always unhappy 
After a while.. I called him and said look can we talk about this i dont know why you’re so angry and he told me to fuck off and said he’s not gonna talk to me 
And then later.. I was in bed and he came in talking about how I’m never happy, I always make him feel bad and take his self esteem away. He said he dreads coming home to me and doesn’t wanna be with me anymore etc etc so I let him and speak and then when I tried to reply, he told me to Fuck off and shut the door on me

Can someone explain what the hell just happened? I have no idea what I did to deserve that.. I didn’t even raise my voice or swear back

He slept in the living room.. and when he woke up he was slamming doors while I was still sleeping, he left the living in such a state aswell.. empty coke bottles and glasses, his clothes dumped, the coffee table covered in crumbs and tobacco bits 

I called him and asked him he’s being so nasty, while he didn’t even clean up a bit ? And he just got super defensive again saying things that didn’t been make sense and then hung up on me..

We live in different city, we are both quarantining with our families and we are university students in a third city. I know that his father has been been physically violent with him all his life but he doesn't go home often because of that but now because of the virus he had to.

We were arguing literally all night on the phone about unimportant stuff and stress, suddenly around 7 a.m. he hangs up. He calls me again after like 10 minutes and says that his father burst in his room so he had to hang up. Okay, we continue talking we finally start to reach to an agreement about our fight when around 8 a.m. he hangs up again. This time he calls me around 30-40 minutes later, he is crying. I ask him what's wrong he tells me that his parents were fighting the first time his father came in the room he took his phone and throw it on the ground and left the room. Then my boyfriend called me again, and the second time he hang up, his father came into his room again and hit him with some object on his mouth and broke one of his lower teeth.

So my boyfriend is crying I ask him to please go to a dentist it might be serious, he tells me he won't he just needs to stop the bleeding. He says his father left and that he feels better now he just needs to stop the bleeding. He says he'll leave tomorrow back to the city where we study at, he just needs to find a place to live very quickly, and he tells me he'll report his father to the police. I get scared and tell him that maybe he should do that after he leaves so that his father won't be able to do anything to him, because in our country the police doesn't do shit about domestic violence cases.

He says he doesn't care anymore even if his father beats him up completely but he has to call the police, and that he'll do it later. We talk some more, I try to keep his mind off of it maybe I made a mistake there. He then tells me around 9:30 a.m. that he'll start studying I ask him if he's okay he says yes we'll talk later, and we hang up. I know I'm awful I didn't do anything.

Then I massage him around 10 a.m. asking him how he's feeling if his tooth hurts and if he stopped the bleeding, he doesn't reply but it says that he's online and the messages I send are being delivered. I call him he doesn't answer, I call him a lot of times he doesn't answer, I text him, I message him on facebook he doesn't answer. Around 40 minutes later he goes offline, and his phone is turned off. Now it's been 3 hours, I keep calling him every 10 minutes it's still off.

I flinch and he says ""did you think I was going to hit you? I would never hit you.""


He knows how I grew up how my relationship with my parents isn't the greatest and dispite me flinching every time, he still does it. As a joke of course. 


There was many things that have happened over the past year of us living together.. for example: he asks me to do his laundry for him... but if they aren't done immediately after he asks he gets annoyed and does it himself while bitching about me not doing it. I will be doing homework for my college course when he asks. Adding to this, one night I got really drunk and kissed a female friend of mine as someone else who is closer to my boyfriend suggested it and my boyfriend said ""I wish I let you die last night."". I told him when I found out it was a thing that had happened as I did not remember it.  When I brought it up again he said it was just a joke. He was upset and it was a bad joke. I did not and still do not believe him that it was just a joke... not with the way he was looking at me and how angry he was about it.


I recently moved out and back in with roommates, he knows I get anxious when it comes to the "" I need to talk to you"" stuff. But that's the message he sent for me to come back over. When I got there ""its nothing now that you are here."", ""I dont want to talk about it anymore."" And ""I'm giving you an out."" 


I am still working on moving things out of his place. The place where he lives alone in a 3 bedroom apartment as he didnt want to move... but he makes it seem like my fault that he does not have any money. All I do is apologize for leaving him like that... dispite him having the option to move as well.


I no longer know what I want to do... maybe I want to see if things get better while we live separately. Maybe I shouldn't though... 


TL;DR: my relationship has been rocky over the past year living together. I feel he does things just to get a reaction out of me sometimes. He always wants me to do things on his time even though I'm busy doing something else. I moved out to see if things will get better.. so far they have not.

I've been married for 13 years and we have been through a lot together. Lots of good stuff and we have a strong bond. I used to say I was addicted to him. He says me and our son is his family. But there has always been abuse, both verbal and physical in our marriage. First I blamed it on him being younger (10 years younger) , then because I have more sexual experience than him, me being swedish and him muslim and I gave up everything for him. Changed my behave and country. For years it was better, only every few months would he be abusive and maybe only a couple of times per year violent. We were made homeless in January and got a flat shortly after that and then all hell broke lose. 
A month ago I had him arrested and the day after I gave a lengthy statement to the police and he could possibly face a long time in jail.
Now I'm being accused of being the only woman in the world that tells the police everything from 13 years ago.

My Dad cheated. They were both young and I believe that if they were a little older they would have worked it out. My mom married  another man when I was 7 and divorced him 5 years later, they fought constantly and the last straw was my mom hearing about him hitting on a girl at a bar. That summer she began dating my current step father. They have been married 10 years now. The first time he hit me, they had been together for maybe a year. There were quite a few times after that, maybe three or four a year for quite a while, every time he did it he was drunk. The last time he did it I was probably 19 and I broke his nose. Flash forward to today: my mom, stepdad, aunt, uncle, cousin and her husband went out on the lake and they were drinking all day. Some drama has been happening with my stepbrother and stepsister talking bad to my stepdad about my mom and blaming her for their problems; things that she has no control of. My mom helped them and has cared for them like they were her own kids the whole time. Well, some crap happened and they went to leave the island and the boat wouldn’t start. When my stepdad was trying to work on the motor he was so drunk he fell in the lake. He had already been swimming all day and was already wet so it shouldn’t have been a big deal. When he got back on the boat my mom jokingly said “want another beer clumsy?” Well he started the boat and drove off. My mom said that he was being hateful and they were arguing and when they got in the middle of the lake, he slammed her into the floor of the boat and proceeded to beat the shit out of her. The only reason he stopped was because some guys on another boat heard my mom screaming and went over there and got him off of her and brought my mom on their boat. My mom has swollen knots all over her head and scratches and bruises all over her arms and legs. He fled and nobody has seen him. For a while I was certain that I would kill him if I found him, but now I would just like to see his ass rot in jail. Problem is, he’ll likely stay for 2 hours and be out again. My mom is divorcing him now but I can’t help but feel lost. These past 10 years me and my mom have lived in hell, and for what??? I dealt with so much more than just him hitting me as a kid. His son is my age and he would constantly put me down, bully me, steal girls from me, and pick fights. I believed that it would get better but now... why in the hell did we even bother with them???

I am not justifying domestic violence, I am someone who has been on both the receiving and giving end of it. If you or anyone you know is going through abuse, call the police and seek help asap.

Triggers.

You knew exactly what to say and what to do to trigger me, my weaknesses, my doubts, my fears, my insecurities. I begged you to stop, yelled, screamed, in pain from the bullets you were shooting into my heart. Yet you’d keep going. Switching the lights on one by one until the entire room was filled with a bright brilliance, the color of red. Then, Boom, just like someone pulled the trigger of an execution shot, I’d retaliate. By this point conscious thought no longer existed, only the survival of my precious ego. To this day, I still don’t know why you didn’t stop. Maybe it was my weakness that triggered you, made you continue even though you knew that we were only going to hurt each other. I’m sorry that my actions caused you pain, but you kept pulling the trigger over and over, even when you knew that it would set a fire in my soul that would be impossible to extinguish. I know my triggers now, because of you, I’ve worked every single day to rehabilitate, to understand how to pull myself out of any situation before the alarm bells ring.

I’ve always returned it to sender but its been so draining having to continue seeing his name and take time to do this. Thankfully this seems to finally have tapered off quite a bit recently, though that may just be the pandemic.

I have zero desire to make contact with him to get him this stupid package. I also resent the idea of simply taking it to the UPS store, as that feels like he gets to just continue controlling my behavior and making me cater to his whims, even though I ended things a year ago.

I’m not entirely sure what to do here. I think since the package came via UPS and was never in the possession of USPS, it wouldn’t considered obstructing mail to simply do nothing.

Totally immediately apologized for grabbing him and meant it. Mind you nothing close to this has happened before, my temper is quick, verbal, and fleeting. He said never do it again, said I won't and again, so so sorry.

Minutes later comes back once more, chokes me, hits me in the face, and then punches and breaks my mirror. 

Now I know I started this, but I don't understand what makes someone that took 3 weeks to think about it go into a sudden rampage. Aside from the occasional play fight where he got a little overzealous he has never hit me before. He could have asked for a divorce without all of this. 

I left and stayed with someone because I was scared. But I know we have to talk even if it is just talking terms of getting out of this marriage. So I'm back home now and he will be home in about 2 hours. I'm waiting up so we can talk when he gets home. But I'm terrified right now. I can't just move out, I work from home. And everything is combined so there will have to be a lot of talking at some point. 

I don't expect anyone to read this whole long ass post but I'm scared, alone, and don't know what to do.",domesticviolence,Scared and alone,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/gmdamd/scared_and_alone/,True

Hi all, I posted on here about a week ago about my abusive brother and the effects it had on me, some of these include PTSD, depression, anxiety, borderline personality disorder, and alcoholism. Today I thought the same thing I’ve questioned every day for years and finally decided to ask if anyone else can relate. Do you ever wonder who you would be if things were different? 

If I had a happy childhood would I be able to sleep at night without drinking until I black out? Would I be able to speak openly to my chosen family  who love me? Would I never have developed the fear that someone is always right behind me, breathing over my shoulder and watching me? Would I never have tried to slit my wrists or overdose on pills? Would I be able to get out of bed instead of lying there when the flashbacks overwhelm me? 

I’m so angry by this imaginary version of myself I fantasize was stolen from me. I just want to be okay.",domesticviolence,The person taken from me,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/gmf9te/the_person_taken_from_me/,True

We rarely argue or fight but when we do, it’s pretty heated.  Well, last month, he became violent for the first time ever. 

He’s intensely stressed out with Covid as he’s a frontline physician in the hospital. He also has PTSD from the of death of his parents at a young age and they were alcoholics and fought all the time. So he gets anxious and panicky over the thought of loosing his family (I know no excuse) and that’s what he’s been most worried over with the pandemic is getting sick and dying or bringing it home to us and we get sick and die.

Anyway- during the fight he was screaming in my face that I’m a dumb bitch and stupid because I wasted $3 on the kids on Easter grass when we already had Easter grass and there’s millions of people without work, going to drive up food banks. He told me we had some and when I went out to get the Easter goodies, I bought it because I didn’t see any in the Easter box in storage. He admitted it wasn’t about the $3 grass but that I didn’t listen to him. I told him he was being abusive and needs to stop calling me names but he kept ranting. He finally got in my face with his finger pointing in my face swearing and yelling. I hit his hand away with my left hand (I’m right handed) and he ended up grabbing me by the hair and throwing me down and shaking me up and down  and threatened to kill me.  I know I should have walked away to my room but I didn’t.  The next day, I went to the ED to get X-rays because my clavicle hurt and I was concerned it might be broken. I had to drive out of state to get to a hospital that my health insurance would cover and that wasn’t his work place. I had bruises on me for 10 days after on my arms and fingers. 

He’s never made a threat to hurt me beyond threats to divorce me. He’s called me names before..maybe 3x since I’ve ever known him and it never happened before we got married. I know I wouldn’t have married him if he had. My mother left my dad when I was 1.5 years old because he became violent with her so she raised me to not accept anything like that. I never been in a physically violent relationship before. 

I don’t trust him anymore. I don’t want to live a life walking on egg shells. I don’t see a lot changing.  He’s in a stressful job that he dislikes. He’s not hit the kids but he’s threatened our son and has gotten in his face threatening to knock his lights out to get him to do what he wants or to punish or scare him. Anyway—- does this sound like escalating abuse?

I keep researching  for stats on repeat offending because I suspect once someone crosses that line, it’s hard to not do it again. I realize it’s very much about being in control of us and he probably thinks he’s being protective of us. His friends have died or diagnosed with cancer etc and as we age, it’s just going to keep happening with the loss of friends etc and sensing our own mortality. I  don’t know if I can trust him ever again to be able to handle stress without getting so angry and violent. 

I don’t think he will harm me any time right now. But I’ve started to take precautions just in case I need to leave quickly. I have a bag packed and in the car and the kids clothes packed. I changed my password in my phone. We long have had separate bank accounts.I have cash in a locked cabinet in my private office at work. So I think I’m good there. 

He tells me that he started to go to therapy at my insistence and I saw the insurance copay bill come in the mail so I know he attended an appt (TeleHealth) with the therapist at least once since then. But what’s the chances of him never doing this again? 

When he let go of me, he said “how many times have you hit me?” Which was totally to gaslight me. I’ve never hit him before and he’s apparently taking me batting his hand out of my face as hitting him which is both concerning and manipulative when he was being aggressive.   The other thing that was concerning is when I asked him how his therapy session go and what did the therapist say, he responded with “he acted like it was the 20th tome he heard my story today”. I felt like he was trying to normalize and justify becoming abusive. 

So my questions are: 
(1) does this sound like the pattern or escalating abuse? 
(2) what are the chances of someone becoming physically violent again? I know this is a national emergency but still...",domesticviolence,First time,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/gmi91b/first_time/,True

I meant Jon 6 months ago and immediately fell in love. Soulmate status. I felt like I had finally found my forever person. 
We had only been dating two months when this pandemic hit. Due to our seasonal life, we both lost our jobs, and Jon lost his housing. Things were going well between us, so I told him just to move in with me. 

About a week later, Jons best friend committed suicide. This was hard for both of us, but especially hard for him. Jon has bipolar disorder and spiraled. It got to the point where I had to bring him to the ER and he was put on a psych hold for three days. 

When he came back, he still wouldn’t really talk about his friend, but said he didn’t want to drink anymore because it makes him too sad. We were sober for about a week before he said he wanted to have some beers. We both got drunk, and he started crying, and when I was trying to console him I said “this is something that you’ll eventually move on from”, and he got mad. Like, really mad. He got physically violent with me. I vented to some friends about it, and one of the friends told my little brother who told me to leave. I didn’t want to, because I knew just how much shit Jon was going through at the time and I forgave him. 

Flash forward to a few days ago. It’s been MONTHS of quarantine and we finally have an opportunity to get back to work, but we have to move. So on the move, we stop at his friends bar along the way. I got drunk. Jealous about his female friend telling me all about how they used to pretend to date so they could have housing together. And I went to the car packed with all of our stuff and tried to drive away. Jon tried to grab my keys but in my drunken rage I hit him, so he choked me. I screamed, the cops came to the bar, and I asked them to separate us for the night because I was drunk and angry. 

I called my mom and told her about it. And about the first time. I told her how angry I was, how I wasn’t sure I wanted to be with someone who would do that to me, and she agreed. 
Jon and I met for breakfast the next morning and talked through things, we both apologized for our overreactions, and continued the move to our new job. 
We get to the job and it is beautiful. And we would finally have an income, some purpose in the days, a beautiful property, and free housing and food. 

I got there, and I found out that my mom was sending my brother on a 12 hour drive to come get me, and that if I didn’t leave the job that day she was going to send family friends in the area to come get me “away from Jon”. And if I didn’t leave, she would call my employer and tell them everything. 
To stop any huge scene from happening, Jon and I unpacked our belongings and moved him in, and put all of my things back in the car and I had to drive away and leave the job and my boyfriend. 

She is making me come home, which is 2,500 miles away, and go to counseling because she thinks I’ve been brainwashed into staying in this relationship with someone who she views as some manipulative abuser. 

This is because I drunkenly called and vented to my mom. I no longer have a choice on where I can work, live, or do with my life, because she threatened Jons life and livelihood. 

How the hell can I convince my mother to let me stay on the west coast with him at the job I want to be working when she just thinks I’ve been being abused? 

I drove two hours away and spent the night in a hotel or my brother was going to keep driving through the night to ‘get’ me. 

TL;DR - Boyfriend and I had a physical altercation, and my mother gave me no choice but to drive 2,500 miles or she would ruin the life of my boyfriend. I don’t want to leave.

She's generally sweet and our relationship is fairly good. She has had some unfortunate relationships in the past, including one that was emotionally abusive and the guy even hit her in the face in front of her family.. Having said that, there have been a couple instances that make me anxious and I'm unsure of how to proceed. 

Instance 1 - We had a group of friends come over and she get incredibly drunk and blacked out part of the night. She was incredibly emotional and at multiple times told her best friend she doesn't think I care about her while I was standing 6 feet away each time. I had even invited her best friend over because of how sad she (my gf) was feeling that her friend wasn't there. There were some other inappropriate things that night and I told her that I wasn't comfortable with that. The next morning I told her that I wanted her to go back to therapy.

Instance 2 - After a night of drinking, we facetimed her best friend as we were closed to going to bed. During the conversation I made an off-hand reference to my gf's ex about how I didn't remember his name because I had been drunk when I met him. My girlfriend's face turned incredibly angry and she tried to choke me with one hand, and when I took her hand off my neck she tried with the next hand. This was while her friend was on the phone. She hung up shortly after. I told my girlfriend that if she ever did that again that we were done. She said it happened because her ex's name triggered a bunch of her past memories, but that she wasn't trying to make that an excuse for what happened.  She still slept over that night because I couldn't bring myself to tell her to leave...

Instance 3 - We went to a friend's house and the night was going great. At a certain point were were sort of alone and she had her hand around my neck, which in a normal world I don't see that as a bad thing (just like a normal hands on the head / neck which would be comforting in some situations). But she went ahead and applied a little bit of pressure all the while having a really jokey face. I told her to not do that ever and she said she was sorry and I don't really remember the rest of the conversation because I was upset and drunk. She did say she wouldn't do it again.

I'm a guy and I feel incredibly weird about this. When I told my best friend this he said he was scared for me. I don't really feel 'scared' physically, but I do feel anxious just because I don't know how much of her reaction of going to therapy or saying that she won't do that again is truly real. It complicates things more when we both share the same friends from before we were together.  I've talked to my therapist about this but it doesn't feel like it's helping. I apologize if this is sort of scattered.

We have been together for 27 years. There has been some historical violence in our past and usually occurs just a few times a year. I’m not sure if it’s my fault.

Usually an argument starts about something stupid like why I opened the curtains when he just closed them even tho I didn’t know that. I told him that I just wanted some sunshine and I opened the curtains. He told me that I was being defiant and not obeying him like I said I would during our marriage vows. I apologized and said that I didn’t know he had just closed the curtains. That went on for about 10 minutes. I walked away and went to bed to cool off as I couldn’t handle the conversation of me being disobedient cuz I really didn’t think that I was and I was really going to lay into him about the whole “I shall obey my husband” speech. I k we better than to get started on that conversation. He came up to see me about 10 minutes later and laid on the bed with me. He started to talk calmly about it with me and then started with how disobedient I am and how defiant I am towards him all the time. He starting laying I. To me about it and was really pushing my buttons to the point I was seeing red and was going to punch him. I started to feel threatened and really angry so I kicked his leg to push him out of my way. It was not hard but I still kicked him. He then grabbed me by my hair, lifted me off there best and threw me face down in to the bed. He had my arm behind my back and was pulling my hair so hard that my neck was bending towards my back.  I could feel the muscles pulling in my back. I told him he was being an asshole and I didn’t care that he thought I was disobedient or defiant and that he could f himself. I couldn’t move or do anything to physically get out of the situation. He made me repeat what I said and if I didn’t he would pull harder on my arm and my hair. So I said it. He then flipped me over on to my back and was sitting on top of me. He had his hands around my throat and his knees on my arms. He had my legs pinned under his somehow. I couldn’t move. He looked at me and told me he was going to rape me and that I would probably like it. I started crying and he got off of me and let me go. I started to walk away and then he starts telling me again what a disobedient bitch I am and that I broke my promise to God. I got in his face and told him he was a dick and he can go f himself.

I don’t know I started the argument. I shouldn’t have kicked him. I should have used my words like a normal person. I have a temper and I know I do and being enraged when I can’t get my words out is a very volatile situation for me.

Writing this on behalf of my friend. She's been dealing with a crazy ex-boyfriend who's been physically and mentally abusing her for a long time now. She has a lot of struggles with self-harm and keeping herself happy, she doesn't have many friends and I'm the one who's has given her the support to leave this relationship she's been suffering in for so long. 

I continue to do this, however this dude is the definition of scum. He hacked her Discord and has made her paranoid online. She's made a new one, he found it. He even found out some of my personal information and has been emailing me the same nonsense threats as her. Things such as he's going to ""pay her back"", ""hurt her"", telling her she's better off dead. And that he won't stop until she's dead he said.

This is all fine and easy to ignore online, as he lives in another continent to her. However he has emailed me detailing he plans to fly over and to see her and ""give some pay back"". He's spamming my email, since I informed my friend of how to block him everywhere. So she doesn't know he plans to do this yet.

She lives with her family, but her family also mentally and physically abuses her. For instance, no matter how much she tells her mother they're broken up and etc. She still doesn't believe her and continues to ""support"" the relationship. He plans to contact the mother to have her bring him over. I have little doubt she'd actually do this and she's aware of the abuse in the relationship, as my friend has told her several times. 

My friend has no job, a very little amount of money (around $600), I'm the only positive support in her life it seems. She needs to escape from both her family and this man who wants her dead. In this situation, what can she do? She lives in California, the dude in Sweden. The girl is over 18.

I’m coming to the realisation that my marriage of 10 years is not just dysfunctional, but abusive. I don’t really have anyone to talk to about it or to work through things with. 

I have had two therapists in the past year, the first didn’t really gel with me and just kept telling me I should leave my husband if I didn’t like his behaviour, as if it was an easy thing to do after 10 years. The second has repeatedly warned me not to throw away my relationship and to work more on my marriage. 

We did couples therapy briefly and I found that we usually ended up talking about my behaviour rather than his. I was thinking about getting us back into it but from what I’ve read that’s not a good idea. 

How do I find a therapist who understands and who will help me work through the muddle in my head? I’ve tried searching therapist directories but I get loads of results if I filter for “abuse” and I can’t possibly call them all to see what their attitude to abuse is.

I (f 25) find myself in a relationship with a man (m 25) who is generally kind, loving and fiercely loyal. For the most part we have a good relationship and have a lot of fun together, and we started up a share house together which has been a joy. We just celebrated our 2yr anniversary. At the beginning of the relationship we both showed abusive tendancies (me, control and jealousy. Him, violence) we both went to therapy and worked on ourselves, which went well! We didn't have any incidence of violence in three months. However we had an incident the other day.

We had just finished watching a movie together and he went and turned the light on. I said it hurt my eyes and went and turned it off. He then said he needed it on and turned it on again and I then turned it off. He then turned it on and restrained my hands. I asked him to let go, then I yelled for him to let go, then I went to kick him to let me go. He then hit me hard on the back. 

A good compromise would have been for us to turn the lamp on but at the time neither of us could communicate that. I'm scared now that this violence happened that we're not as recovered as I thought.

And I really feel like the author of this piece.  I relate so much and our situations are so similar. 

I’m with someone who is mad all the time, Pissed off all the time. When he gets mad at me he yells at me, tells me to shut the fuck up, shut my mouth, I’m a b****, a c***, a hoe, pretty much every bad name you can call someone. Tells
Me how I’ve let myself go and I’m just fat and lazy these days and not the girl he fell in love with. Accuses me of cheating on him. He gets so mad he gets in my face and puts a fist to my cheek and holds it there tightly and asks if I want to be punched in the mouth, or tells me if I don’t shut up he will punch he in the face. He shoves and restrains me sometimes. If I say we are over he grabs a gun and says he is going to go kill Himself And that no one cares if he dies. If I try to call The police he gets ENRAGED at me and says that I should not be involving the police, he will do whatever he can to get the phone from me. He is too strong and I do not stand a chance. 

Reading this I know it’s why not just leave him? Seems easy from the outside looking in. But I worry about him he really has some childhood trauma and some depression/ something undiagnosed that he won’t go get help for. He says he blacks out in rage and he is always saying he’s sorry for the things he does but then does them again. I really think he could have a better quality of life he went and got help. It makes me think maybe things can be fixed and the sweet warm funny person I knew before will come back. 

He just seems like he has lost his way. I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m tired of feeling like this. But I don’t want this to end in some huge battle royale. I just want him to be nice to me.

I flinch and he says ""did you think I was going to hit you? I would never hit you.""


He knows how I grew up how my relationship with my parents isn't the greatest and dispite me flinching every time, he still does it. As a joke of course. 


There was many things that have happened over the past year of us living together.. for example: he asks me to do his laundry for him... but if they aren't done immediately after he asks he gets annoyed and does it himself while bitching about me not doing it. I will be doing homework for my college course when he asks. Adding to this, one night I got really drunk and kissed a female friend of mine as someone else who is closer to my boyfriend suggested it and my boyfriend said ""I wish I let you die last night."". I told him when I found out it was a thing that had happened as I did not remember it.  When I brought it up again he said it was just a joke. He was upset and it was a bad joke. I did not and still do not believe him that it was just a joke... not with the way he was looking at me and how angry he was about it.


I recently moved out and back in with roommates, he knows I get anxious when it comes to the "" I need to talk to you"" stuff. But that's the message he sent for me to come back over. When I got there ""its nothing now that you are here."", ""I dont want to talk about it anymore."" And ""I'm giving you an out."" 


I am still working on moving things out of his place. The place where he lives alone in a 3 bedroom apartment as he didnt want to move... but he makes it seem like my fault that he does not have any money. All I do is apologize for leaving him like that... dispite him having the option to move as well.


I no longer know what I want to do... maybe I want to see if things get better while we live separately. Maybe I shouldn't though... 


TL;DR: my relationship has been rocky over the past year living together. I feel he does things just to get a reaction out of me sometimes. He always wants me to do things on his time even though I'm busy doing something else. I moved out to see if things will get better.. so far they have not.

But there has always been abuse, both verbal and physical in our marriage. First I blamed it on him being younger (10 years younger) , then because I have more sexual experience than him, me being swedish and him muslim and I gave up everything for him. Changed my behave and country. For years it was better, only every few months would he be abusive and maybe only a couple of times per year violent. We were made homeless in January and got a flat shortly after that and then all hell broke lose. 
A month ago I had him arrested and the day after I gave a lengthy statement to the police and he could possibly face a long time in jail.

My Dad cheated. They were both young and I believe that if they were a little older they would have worked it out. My mom married  another man when I was 7 and divorced him 5 years later, they fought constantly and the last straw was my mom hearing about him hitting on a girl at a bar. That summer she began dating my current step father. They have been married 10 years now. The first time he hit me, they had been together for maybe a year. There were quite a few times after that, maybe three or four a year for quite a while, every time he did it he was drunk. The last time he did it I was probably 19 and I broke his nose. Flash forward to today: my mom, stepdad, aunt, uncle, cousin and her husband went out on the lake and they were drinking all day. Some drama has been happening with my stepbrother and stepsister talking bad to my stepdad about my mom and blaming her for their problems; things that she has no control of. My mom helped them and has cared for them like they were her own kids the whole time. Well, some crap happened and they went to leave the island and the boat wouldn’t start. When my stepdad was trying to work on the motor he was so drunk he fell in the lake. He had already been swimming all day and was already wet so it shouldn’t have been a big deal. When he got back on the boat my mom jokingly said “want another beer clumsy?” Well he started the boat and drove off. My mom said that he was being hateful and they were arguing and when they got in the middle of the lake, he slammed her into the floor of the boat and proceeded to beat the shit out of her. The only reason he stopped was because some guys on another boat heard my mom screaming and went over there and got him off of her and brought my mom on their boat. My mom has swollen knots all over her head and scratches and bruises all over her arms and legs. He fled and nobody has seen him. For a while I was certain that I would kill him if I found him, but now I would just like to see his ass rot in jail. Problem is, he’ll likely stay for 2 hours and be out again. My mom is divorcing him now but I can’t help but feel lost. These past 10 years me and my mom have lived in hell, and for what??? I dealt with so much more than just him hitting me as a kid. His son is my age and he would constantly put me down, bully me, steal girls from me, and pick fights. I believed that it would get better but now... why in the hell did we even bother with them???

Triggers.

You knew exactly what to say and what to do to trigger me, my weaknesses, my doubts, my fears, my insecurities. I begged you to stop, yelled, screamed, in pain from the bullets you were shooting into my heart. Yet you’d keep going. Switching the lights on one by one until the entire room was filled with a bright brilliance, the color of red. Then, Boom, just like someone pulled the trigger of an execution shot, I’d retaliate. By this point conscious thought no longer existed, only the survival of my precious ego. To this day, I still don’t know why you didn’t stop. Maybe it was my weakness that triggered you, made you continue even though you knew that we were only going to hurt each other. I’m sorry that my actions caused you pain, but you kept pulling the trigger over and over, even when you knew that it would set a fire in my soul that would be impossible to extinguish. I know my triggers now, because of you, I’ve worked every single day to rehabilitate, to understand how to pull myself out of any situation before the alarm bells ring.

I’ve always returned it to sender but its been so draining having to continue seeing his name and take time to do this.

I have zero desire to make contact with him to get him this stupid package. I also resent the idea of simply taking it to the UPS store, as that feels like he gets to just continue controlling my behavior and making me cater to his whims, even though I ended things a year ago.

Backstory is...my husband and I only got married 5 months ago (but together for 8 years). I can say there has been emotional abuse along the way. He is the king of the silent treatment (weeks). 

I have a quick temper that I work on but sometimes I regress. One such time was 3 weeks ago. Husband carries a lot of anger because he hated his job. He likes to take it out on me by nitpicking. On this occasion I snapped a little, grabbed his arm and angrily told him to give it a rest. 
Totally immediately apologized for grabbing him and meant it. Mind you nothing close to this has happened before, my temper is quick, verbal, and fleeting. He said never do it again, said I won't and again, so so sorry. 

He retreats to basement and since we have different schedules, it is easy to avoid each other. I genuinely feel bad, I write him notes, bake him lots of things, send him emails. Nothing. 

Now to last night. I'm dead asleep in bed, after 3 weeks of silence (but I'm still cooking for him, packing his lunches, etc) he charges in screams a bunch of stuff, one being I want a divorce. Slams door. Not a minute later, comes back, spits in my face and again says he wants a divorce. Minutes later comes back once more, chokes me, hits me in the face, and then punches and breaks my mirror. 

Now I know I started this, but I don't understand what makes someone that took 3 weeks to think about it go into a sudden rampage. Aside from the occasional play fight where he got a little overzealous he has never hit me before. He could have asked for a divorce without all of this. 

I left and stayed with someone because I was scared. But I know we have to talk even if it is just talking terms of getting out of this marriage.

I don't have any evidence of course, it's not like there were video cameras rolling at our house back then. Of course my father would 100% deny it happened. When I told relatives about these events much later, my father called me a liar, and said I was just trying to make him look bad in front of the relatives.

But just for completeness, and for recording that this event happened, can I call the police? Would they interview him?

I'm currently writing a grade 12 persuasive speech highlighting the issue surrounding male domestic violence.

What I'm trying to get across is that due to men making up a majority of perpetrators, male victims don't get the required support. Due to cultural assumptions, we generally see men as the abusers and women/children as the victims. Stereotypes don't appear to help this, with a lot of men feeling ashamed about sharing their story, as they worry people might perceive them as weak or as not 'masculine'. This is actually a serious issue, as male suicide rates are pretty high, especially around the ages of 30-50, so abuse from a partner or other family member could be a contributing factor.

Writing this on behalf of my friend. She's been dealing with a crazy ex-boyfriend who's been physically and mentally abusing her for a long time now. She has a lot of struggles with self-harm and keeping herself happy, she doesn't have many friends and I'm the one who's has given her the support to leave this relationship she's been suffering in for so long. 

I continue to do this, however this dude is the definition of scum. He hacked her Discord and has made her paranoid online. She's made a new one, he found it. He even found out some of my personal information and has been emailing me the same nonsense threats as her. Things such as he's going to ""pay her back"", ""hurt her"", telling her she's better off dead. And that he won't stop until she's dead he said.

This is all fine and easy to ignore online, as he lives in another continent to her. However he has emailed me detailing he plans to fly over and to see her and ""give some pay back"". He's spamming my email, since I informed my friend of how to block him everywhere. So she doesn't know he plans to do this yet.

She lives with her family, but her family also mentally and physically abuses her. For instance, no matter how much she tells her mother they're broken up and etc. She still doesn't believe her and continues to ""support"" the relationship. He plans to contact the mother to have her bring him over. I have little doubt she'd actually do this and she's aware of the abuse in the relationship, as my friend has told her several times. 

My friend has no job, a very little amount of money (around $600), I'm the only positive support in her life it seems. She needs to escape from both her family and this man who wants her dead. In this situation, what can she do? She lives in California, the dude in Sweden. The girl is over 18.

I’m coming to the realisation that my marriage of 10 years is not just dysfunctional, but abusive. I don’t really have anyone to talk to about it or to work through things with. 

I have had two therapists in the past year, the first didn’t really gel with me and just kept telling me I should leave my husband if I didn’t like his behaviour, as if it was an easy thing to do after 10 years. The second has repeatedly warned me not to throw away my relationship and to work more on my marriage. 

We did couples therapy briefly and I found that we usually ended up talking about my behaviour rather than his. I was thinking about getting us back into it but from what I’ve read that’s not a good idea. 

How do I find a therapist who understands and who will help me work through the muddle in my head? I’ve tried searching therapist directories but I get loads of results if I filter for “abuse” and I can’t possibly call them all to see what their attitude to abuse is.

I (f 25) find myself in a relationship with a man (m 25) who is generally kind, loving and fiercely loyal. For the most part we have a good relationship and have a lot of fun together, and we started up a share house together which has been a joy. We just celebrated our 2yr anniversary. At the beginning of the relationship we both showed abusive tendancies (me, control and jealousy. Him, violence) we both went to therapy and worked on ourselves, which went well! We didn't have any incidence of violence in three months. However we had an incident the other day.

We had just finished watching a movie together and he went and turned the light on. I said it hurt my eyes and went and turned it off. He then said he needed it on and turned it on again and I then turned it off. He then turned it on and restrained my hands. I asked him to let go, then I yelled for him to let go, then I went to kick him to let me go. He then hit me hard on the back. 

A good compromise would have been for us to turn the lamp on but at the time neither of us could communicate that. I'm scared now that this violence happened that we're not as recovered as I thought.

Me how I’ve let myself go and I’m just fat and lazy these days and not the girl he fell in love with. Accuses me of cheating on him. He gets so mad he gets in my face and puts a fist to my cheek and holds it there tightly and asks if I want to be punched in the mouth, or tells me if I don’t shut up he will punch he in the face. He shoves and restrains me sometimes. If I say we are over he grabs a gun and says he is going to go kill Himself And that no one cares if he dies. If I try to call The police he gets ENRAGED at me and says that I should not be involving the police, he will do whatever he can to get the phone from me. He is too strong and I do not stand a chance. 

Reading this I know it’s why not just leave him? Seems easy from the outside looking in. But I worry about him he really has some childhood trauma and some depression/ something undiagnosed that he won’t go get help for. He says he blacks out in rage and he is always saying he’s sorry for the things he does but then does them again. I really think he could have a better quality of life he went and got help. It makes me think maybe things can be fixed and the sweet warm funny person I knew before will come back.

He knows how I grew up how my relationship with my parents isn't the greatest and dispite me flinching every time, he still does it. As a joke of course. 


There was many things that have happened over the past year of us living together.. for example: he asks me to do his laundry for him... but if they aren't done immediately after he asks he gets annoyed and does it himself while bitching about me not doing it. I will be doing homework for my college course when he asks.

I told him when I found out it was a thing that had happened as I did not remember it.  When I brought it up again he said it was just a joke. He was upset and it was a bad joke. I did not and still do not believe him that it was just a joke... not with the way he was looking at me and how angry he was about it.

When I got there ""its nothing now that you are here."", ""I dont want to talk about it anymore."" And ""I'm giving you an out.""

That summer she began dating my current step father. They have been married 10 years now. The first time he hit me, they had been together for maybe a year. There were quite a few times after that, maybe three or four a year for quite a while, every time he did it he was drunk. The last time he did it I was probably 19 and I broke his nose. Flash forward to today: my mom, stepdad, aunt, uncle, cousin and her husband went out on the lake and they were drinking all day. Some drama has been happening with my stepbrother and stepsister talking bad to my stepdad about my mom and blaming her for their problems; things that she has no control of. My mom helped them and has cared for them like they were her own kids the whole time. Well, some crap happened and they went to leave the island and the boat wouldn’t start. When my stepdad was trying to work on the motor he was so drunk he fell in the lake. He had already been swimming all day and was already wet so it shouldn’t have been a big deal. When he got back on the boat my mom jokingly said “want another beer clumsy?” Well he started the boat and drove off. My mom said that he was being hateful and they were arguing and when they got in the middle of the lake, he slammed her into the floor of the boat and proceeded to beat the shit out of her. The only reason he stopped was because some guys on another boat heard my mom screaming and went over there and got him off of her and brought my mom on their boat. My mom has swollen knots all over her head and scratches and bruises all over her arms and legs. He fled and nobody has seen him. For a while I was certain that I would kill him if I found him, but now I would just like to see his ass rot in jail. Problem is, he’ll likely stay for 2 hours and be out again. My mom is divorcing him now but I can’t help but feel lost. These past 10 years me and my mom have lived in hell, and for what??? I dealt with so much more than just him hitting me as a kid. His son is my age and he would constantly put me down, bully me, steal girls from me, and pick fights. I believed that it would get better but now... why in the hell did we even bother with them??? Knowing what I know now, what was the purpose? There are so many different things I could say but this is a long enough post.

I was born in October, 2004. I was living with my mother and father, until eight months later they split up because my mum said that I was a mistake and that she no longer wanted me, which caused my dad to move out and find someone new to raise me with (to be my next step mum or something like that). Me and my dad moved in with a single mother of two boys, and this was before I even had my first birthday. My dad and soon to be step mum lived together for 8 years and in that timeframe my little brother was born.

The day came, the day where my dad would walk in on my stepmother and my soon to be abusive sort of stepfather having sex. Things did not turn out well, my dad and stepmum got into an extreme argument, and they started to fight, me and my little brother were inside of the living room where we could hear the while thing unfold. My Abusive stepfather thing was upstairs calling the police to get my dad out of the house. 30 minutes later the police came to drag my dad outside, and while I saw what was happening i kept telling my dad to let me go and live with him, because i loved my dad and he meant the world to me. He was then arrested for two days and then let go when they found out that he was innocent and no one got hurt. A few days after he got out of prison my dad called my stepmother so that he could talk to me. The conversation went something like this (D= Dad. Me= Me)

D:  Hi, son I want to let you know that I'm ok and that I am out of prison now so if you want to talk, I'm here for you.
Me: Ok dad, can I come live with you though.
D: Buddy listen, you cant come and live with me now because I have to work all day and you're only 8, which means that you cant look after yourself.
Me: Yea I can, I'm a big boy.
D: i know you are buddy, but no means no. I am so sorry son, go put me on the phone with mummy and remember I love you very very much.

Little did I know that giving that phone to my stepmother would set off this bomb that was my abusive step father.

After I gave my phone and went downstairs to play with my legos. My ASF (abusive step father) came in to the room I was in and punched me in the back of the head. (He has no problems with alcoholism or a mental health disorder) and he said to me ""Dont you ever talk to that disgusting wife beater again, DO YOU HEAR ME."" 
Me: [crying] ""y-yes""
ASF: ""If I ever hear you speaking to him again I will hit you ten times harder""
Me: ""N-no please dont""

[I am already starting to tear up, and I am just going to tell you all of the significant times and the times that I am constantly being haunted by, because of PTSD]

Time #1: Me and ASF were walking into town to get some groceries, but to get to the town we have to cross this field of grass which is about a mile long. Me and ASF were having a chat (I was 8/9 at the time and I didnt know what he was like). I must have said something that offended him because he started to strangle me and did not let go until I almost passed out.

Time #2: for a few weeks now, I had been going over to my dads every weekend because he was free on the weekends and we both wanted to see eachother. One week though my dad had bought me a new book about trains and when I bought that book home ASF took one look and the cover, saw that it said dad on the cover and then started to hit me with the book. (I was about 10 at the time).

Time #3: ASF had been abusing me on numerous occasions and when my dad saw the bruises on my arms, he asked me about them and I told him about ASF He took me down to the police station to tell my story, the police say the will look into it, but later my dad got a text saying that they can't look into the case because I was only a kid and that I was just making stuff up. This had a huge impact on me and now I have trust issues 

Time #4: ASF had hit me so many times that I was so scared of him, and I was excited to go into school because that was my only getaway during the weekdays. I have tried telling my stepmother and school about it but they all just said the same thing ""that I am just a kid, and I am making stuff up"". I went home extremely upset because no one seemed to believe my story, even when I had the marks to justify my points. At this time I went into the kitchen and saw a huge kitchen knife on the table, just left there and so I grabbed it by the handle and pointed it at my throat. My stepmother was just walking into the kitchen when she saw me with the knife, bawling my eyes out. She rushed over to me grabbed the knife out of my hands and said ""dont be so stupid, nothing has happened to you to make you want to kill yourself.""

Time #5: ASF asked me to do something for him, so I tried standing up to myself and said ""no, do it yourself"".
As soon as I hear him shout ""WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY TO ME"" whilst just walking into my room, I immediately regretted it. He grabbed me, put me into the firemans carry position and walked me into the kitchen and shoved a bottle of washing up liquid into my mouth, he just kept holding it down causing it to empty into my mouth, leaving me with a mouthful of washing up liquid, which he then forced me to swallow it and then he did the same thing, filled my mouth and made me swallow it. Three times he did that three times.

Time #6: I was at school, we were in a PE lesson when I accidentally pushed a girl over and she grazed her leg. School called my house phone where of course ASF had to answer it. I walked home and as soon as I opened the door ASF snatched me slammed the door closed, grabbed me by the throat so I couldn't breathe raised me up to the ceiling and then dropped me. I hit my head on the floor causing me to bleed and he left me there. I still have the scar from where I fell and hit the floor.

Time #7: I was doing my homework when my pen exploded. I asked ASF if I could have a spare but then he got pissed because I apparently did something to make the pen explode, when I told him that i didn't do anything to the pen he got pissed and threatened to kill me by ""throwing me outside the top floor window and stomping on my head"" at that time my dad had met a new girlfriend and had a place with two bedrooms so I immediately ran outside with my phone and called up my dad and I said that i will be there soon. I ran all night, I ran all the way to my dads house which was like 5 miles away and then my dads girlfriend made me move in with them. I will be forever thankful to her because it felt like all of the pain had just stopped. But then a couple of months later I got sent to the doctors where I got diagnosed with Depression, PTSD, anxiety and bipolar disorder. 

That is all I can write down because there are some stuff that I cant say because I will immediately burst out crying, like the time ASF got my pet dog to rape me. (I know that It sounds weird and like a lie but it isnt. I was there pinned down while he watched, laughing while I was left feeling hopeless).

I am sorry if my stories are a bit scuffed at some points I have been crying the entire time I have been writing this and I cant think straight.",domesticviolence,My story with an abusive stepfather figure.,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/gjz3na/my_story_with_an_abusive_stepfather_figure/,True

I fled my home March 18th to get away from an increasingly tense situation in which I felt unsafe. I won't go into details at this time but note there is destruction of property, financial abuse, verbal abuse, and public humiliation.  Today, at the advice of my counselor to be sure I am covering my bases, I let him know I will be getting my belongings from the home with the help of others, including my cats. I suggested he go to breakfast with his family so that they're not disturbed and I would leave the key there when I leave. 

He sent back an ugly text saying that I would not be allowed into the home that I am still on the lease for, that I would be taken to court for ""committing libel and slander"", and that I would not be allowed to have my pets because I ""abandoned"" them when I fled. 

The kicker is the exact phrasing is what I used to tell our landlords what happened. Either he managed to look at my emails to them, or more than likely, they disclosed what is said to him since I have been fighting them (along with my advocates) to be released from the lease. So now I'm having a full blown panic attack but I calmly send back that they're my cats and he will not keep all three pets (we had two cats and a dog, and he decided to keep the dog). I also stated I will get a police escort if need be.

Since he works for the jail, he thinks he is above the law and the only authority on legal matters. He then told me the police will not help because it is a civil matter. 

I did not respond to him beyond that and instead called the crisis line for my DV organization. I got hold of someone who helped me and who told me to leave a message for my advocate. I did, stating what I knew at that time. Now I see he also changed the password to my account somehow for the rent which has access to my direct checking account.

For several months I’ve heard a male voice coming from my neighbor’s apartment absolutely screaming his head off. Extremely profane. Says “my wife” as he’s yelling a lot so I assume it’s a husband-wife living there. I’ve called the cops whenever he has said anything that sounded like it would lead to self-harm or if I ever heard the woman scream, but they never follow up with me after and it doesn’t seem to help. I finally got apartment management involved but their only solution is to terminate their lease if they continue causing disturbances. 

I don’t feel comfortable getting directly involved since I’m a small woman. And while I’ve never personally met the neighbors, the man came to our door and intimidated my roommate one of the times we called the cops. He also beats directly on his ceiling (literally shaking our floors) and screams at us if we are “walking too loud”, but we are very quiet people, and he does it even when we’re sitting quietly eating/working, so I suspect he hears things. So he has been extremely hostile to us and I’m concerned for the safety of the woman in his apartment.

I also don’t know the whole situation, sometimes he screams about her abusing him. But the screaming happens at all hours of the day and night and I’ve lost a ton of sleep to it and need it to stop. I feel scared to walk around my own apartment or walk by their floor.

He yelled at me and called me profanities in Korean (equivalents of bitch and retard). This happens quite frequently. i only have 2 voice recordings of my father yelling at my mother, one from 2018 and one from today. unfortunately it’s in korean so whoever tried to hear it needs a translator. he is defending his actions of abuse so you can hear a bit of description about what he has done.

My mom doesn’t want me to report him and she doesn’t know this, but i filed a report with Child Services Kids Help Phone today. The lady on the text line said a report was filed with either Child Protection Services or Children’s Aid Society. I couldn’t call 911 while my father was attacking me because my phone was upstairs while he was attacking me downstairs. I don’t have any other proof or pictures, because my mom refuses to let me take pictures of the broken plates and the water. they are already cleaned up. my mom is afraid of reporting my dad since there’s only the 4 of us (mom, dad, my sister and I) living in canada. we would lose our main source of income and our family stability would completely fall apart. i’m only 17 and my sister is 14, so we have years of schooling left and my mom doesn’t have much money. what do you think i should do? what do you think will happen, now that i’ve filed the report with Child protection services?

I'm currently writing a grade 12 persuasive speech highlighting the issue surrounding male domestic violence.

What I'm trying to get across is that due to men making up a majority of perpetrators, male victims don't get the required support. Due to cultural assumptions, we generally see men as the abusers and women/children as the victims. Stereotypes don't appear to help this, with a lot of men feeling ashamed about sharing their story, as they worry people might perceive them as weak or as not 'masculine'. This is actually a serious issue, as male suicide rates are pretty high, especially around the ages of 30-50, so abuse from a partner or other family member could be a contributing factor.

I know this is a touchy subject, but I would really appreciate some help or maybe some sources that would give me some information on domestic violence against males.",domesticviolence,Domestic Violence AGAINST Men,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/gkpa7x/domestic_violence_against_men/,True

Writing this on behalf of my friend. She's been dealing with a crazy ex-boyfriend who's been physically and mentally abusing her for a long time now. She has a lot of struggles with self-harm and keeping herself happy, she doesn't have many friends and I'm the one who's has given her the support to leave this relationship she's been suffering in for so long. 

I continue to do this, however this dude is the definition of scum. He hacked her Discord and has made her paranoid online. She's made a new one, he found it. He even found out some of my personal information and has been emailing me the same nonsense threats as her. Things such as he's going to ""pay her back"", ""hurt her"", telling her she's better off dead. And that he won't stop until she's dead he said.

This is all fine and easy to ignore online, as he lives in another continent to her. However he has emailed me detailing he plans to fly over and to see her and ""give some pay back"". He's spamming my email, since I informed my friend of how to block him everywhere. So she doesn't know he plans to do this yet.

She lives with her family, but her family also mentally and physically abuses her. For instance, no matter how much she tells her mother they're broken up and etc. She still doesn't believe her and continues to ""support"" the relationship. He plans to contact the mother to have her bring him over. I have little doubt she'd actually do this and she's aware of the abuse in the relationship, as my friend has told her several times. 

My friend has no job, a very little amount of money (around $600), I'm the only positive support in her life it seems. She needs to escape from both her family and this man who wants her dead. In this situation, what can she do? She lives in California, the dude in Sweden. The girl is over 18.

I’m coming to the realisation that my marriage of 10 years is not just dysfunctional, but abusive. I don’t really have anyone to talk to about it or to work through things with. 

I have had two therapists in the past year, the first didn’t really gel with me and just kept telling me I should leave my husband if I didn’t like his behaviour, as if it was an easy thing to do after 10 years. The second has repeatedly warned me not to throw away my relationship and to work more on my marriage. 

We did couples therapy briefly and I found that we usually ended up talking about my behaviour rather than his. I was thinking about getting us back into it but from what I’ve read that’s not a good idea. 

How do I find a therapist who understands and who will help me work through the muddle in my head? I’ve tried searching therapist directories but I get loads of results if I filter for “abuse” and I can’t possibly call them all to see what their attitude to abuse is.

I (f 25) find myself in a relationship with a man (m 25) who is generally kind, loving and fiercely loyal. For the most part we have a good relationship and have a lot of fun together, and we started up a share house together which has been a joy. We just celebrated our 2yr anniversary. At the beginning of the relationship we both showed abusive tendancies (me, control and jealousy. Him, violence) we both went to therapy and worked on ourselves, which went well! We didn't have any incidence of violence in three months. However we had an incident the other day.

We had just finished watching a movie together and he went and turned the light on. I said it hurt my eyes and went and turned it off. He then said he needed it on and turned it on again and I then turned it off. He then turned it on and restrained my hands. I asked him to let go, then I yelled for him to let go, then I went to kick him to let me go. He then hit me hard on the back. 

A good compromise would have been for us to turn the lamp on but at the time neither of us could communicate that. I'm scared now that this violence happened that we're not as recovered as I thought.

My husband hasn’t beat me in about two months. While I’m not delusional and I know he will do it again, I didn’t think he would get abusive over something so small and meaningless on a good day.

I had a bottle of raspberry vinegar Windex in my hand and I was done wiping the washer. He was still yelling at me. I told him again he was scaring me but he continued being an asshole. I couldn’t get him off my back. 
He kept yelling at me. So I sprayed his face with the Windex I was holding. 

That stopped him in his tracks, obviously, and for a second he looked at me with a shit ton of anger.

I looked down at the Windex bottle and it said “non-toxic!” on it. I thought he’ll be fine.

My ex (never married) and father of my 1 &amp; 2 year old daughters was arrested in March for Assault Family Violence - Choking/Impeding breath after suffocating me with his hands during an argument. We were laying in bed and after some insults back and forth he rolls over on top me (I was laying sideways - facing away from him) and screams ""BBBIIITTTCCCHHHH!!!"" as loud as he possibly could directly in my ear - his lips were touching my ear, I elbow him off me (mind you - the babies are sleeping in the rooms next door) and that's when he climbs on top of me, grabs my wrists and pins my hands behind my back with all of his body weight, I couldn't move my hands. He puts one hand over my mouth and then the other over my nose. I start to panic and I realized what was going on. I look up and his eyes were completely black and as if there was no soul. I thought 'this is it, I'm going to die.' I knew he wasn't there. Everything started to go black and then I remember feeling his hands moving down to my neck - he had let go but wasn't done with me!!! This is when I'm able to swing myself with all of my might, out from under him and off the bed. I was freaking the f out. We live in a two story home with all the bedrooms upstairs. I run down the stairs where my phone is and call 911. I WAS TERRIFIED. Hysterical. Not only did he almost just kill me, he looked possessed- those eyes- he was still upstairs where our babies were sleeping!! I thought he was going to kill my daughters. I really fucking did. This is actually the first time I've written this out (other than the victim statement on the police report) and it's kind of therapeutic as I am being gaslighted about the entire incident by my abuser. Anyways, I'll make the rest of this short and sweet... there was a protective order for 61 days and a CPS investigation following the incident.

He admitted when he was released from jail (his mom bailed him out from NY) that he did not remember anything (I knew he wouldn't - his eyes) so I re-capped what happened. He cried, begged, pleaded, promised to never drink again, scared of his mind and questioning his own insanity for not remembering what he did to me, saying he needs help. Fast forward 2 weeks into the protective order (he's staying with a friend) and I find out through some snooping that he has lawyered up ($15k) to fight this charge. None of this is expressed to me as I'm meeting him with the girls at the park - to see Daddy. I never had any intention of getting back with him, I'm done, I love my children more than I love him but you would think that he would communicate with me on whats going on with him legally/medically in a case like this as pertaining to the father of my daughters in domestic violence - UNLESS he was trying to stay quiet so I wouldn't cooperate with prosecution. I bring it up and he goes straight to rage - saying I made the whole thing up and that if this goes to court, everyone will see what really happened. Um, what the fuck? I stop the park visits

So now here I am. I have an appointment with a local DV advocate tomorrow morning. My ex has a laundry list of alcohol abuse convictions - 2 DWI's in NY, 1 in TX and 1 PI in TX. He's 32. I'm not trying to bring a man to his knees as far as the assault charge goes, I will cooperate with prosecution but my main concern is the children - custody.

My question is: Are the alcohol abuse/DWI convictions enough to deem him unfit? In which I would request supervised visitation until/unless he enters treatment and then we can re-evaluate. Or do I need to hire an attorney and make sure he is prosecuted for the domestic violence case in order to to protect my children from this man if he doesn't/until he gets the help he needs?",domesticviolence,Child Custody - Pending Domestic Violence Case,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/gjg8yo/child_custody_pending_domestic_violence_case/,True

I (F20) have been with my current bf (M30) about 1.5 years. We have lived together for one, with both our names on the lease. 

He is everything I’d ever want and everything I fear at the same time. He cleans, does the washing and maintains the house, he works, has paid almost all the bills for the entire time we’ve lived together (I’ve had periods of unemployment) and even paid my insurance excess of ~$1000 when I was in a car accident. 

But he’s also a heavy drinker, like his father. His father can’t stand me, has compared me to Hitler and has on multiple occasions said I need to “grow up” and “stop being a spoilt little bitch”. I have been out with my friends 3 times since we got together, and on all but one occasion have been accused of cheating and told not to come home. In Jan 2020 he got so drunk he left a BBQ we were at and began walking home, only to cuss out my godfather and I when we went to pick him up. We left soon after and I took my thinks to a friends.m for the night. He left multiple voicemails from 30+ missed calls, detailing how he was going to kill me and smash up the house when he got home. He made it home and I wasn’t there so he slept on the couch, and promised to cut down. Another broken promise. 

When sober he tells me I’m the love of his life, when drunk he tell me he loves me but I’m x,y,z (expletive). I am the only one who drives, and he depends on me to get to work (he got this job shortly after we met from an advert I sent him) and I have driven him every day since. We have three cats, on of which is “mine”, another “his” and a third is “ours”.

I am so afraid of leaving because of the constant mood changes and not knowing what will come next. He says my mood swings make him crazy but he stays with me because he loves me. He screams at me until I cry and then hugs me and says it’ll be okay. He’s smashed my stuff and thrown things at me, but never hit me. 

I am so worn down I don’t know what to do. If I leave him he’ll most likely go back to drugs and jail. He will lose his job because there is no other way to get to work before 7am, and I fear for the two cats that aren’t “mine”. 

Some people tell me to leave as soon as possible, others (my conservative family included) tell me to work harder on myself and things will get better. I’ve gone back on my antidepressants and started therapy again. I’m working, and trying to function as best I can. 

I don’t know what else to say, but has anyone else been through this? It’s suck a mindfk that it feels like my head is constantly spinning and I can’t tell what’s right from wrong anymore.

When he behaved abusively towards me, I discredited all of his feelings because he was acting so unreasonable. I never considered he was making a real point, mainly because the recurring point was that I'm a ""slut"" that ""flirts with every guy."" I was recently reading about how abusive people have sane, normal feeling, the problem is that they act on feelings with innappropriate behavior. This makes a lot of sense. 

My current boyfriend has pointed out that when I interact with men, the creeper/flirtier a guy is, the more attention I give him. The more attention someone requests from me, the more I give. This explains why all my male ""friends"" end up being guys that wanted to date me and are trying to make moves from the ""friend zone."" 

Long story short, I've learned to mask my social anxiety by pretending to be a happy, ""flirty"" girl. I spent most of high school socially isolated, by choice, with the exception of one person. I think losing them (another relationship) combined with my desire for isolation made me suseptible to an abusive relationship. This made me feel guilty about not being social, so I've spent the last 5 years trying to be more outgoing.

She broke up with him moved back in to the family house and everything was going fine she met a new guy who seemed a genuine nice guy, they’d been dating for a few months before there was little signs like not liking her putting up pictures of herself on instagram or Facebook, taking her phone jokingly but then going through it, then this pandemic started and the kept seeing each other, her mother and I agreed they needed to try adhere to rules until this was over but she decided that would be to long so was gonna stay with him during this. About a week later she said she would just move in with him so she came collected all her stuff and that was that we would still be in contact regular, about 2 weeks after she got all her stuff her mother received a text  from our daughter asking if she could move home. mother said yes then mother received another text from daughters boyfriend saying don’t worry about daughter as she’s just had little to drink, she’s only feeling that way because I hurt her, so the alarm bells were really ringing then she phoned and said she was ok and she’s just going to go to sleep she will speak to us the next day.

I was born in October, 2004. I was living with my mother and father, until eight months later they split up because my mum said that I was a mistake and that she no longer wanted me, which caused my dad to move out and find someone new to raise me with (to be my next step mum or something like that). Me and my dad moved in with a single mother of two boys, and this was before I even had my first birthday. My dad and soon to be step mum lived together for 8 years and in that timeframe my little brother was born.

The day came, the day where my dad would walk in on my stepmother and my soon to be abusive sort of stepfather having sex. Things did not turn out well, my dad and stepmum got into an extreme argument, and they started to fight, me and my little brother were inside of the living room where we could hear the while thing unfold. My Abusive stepfather thing was upstairs calling the police to get my dad out of the house. 30 minutes later the police came to drag my dad outside, and while I saw what was happening i kept telling my dad to let me go and live with him, because i loved my dad and he meant the world to me. He was then arrested for two days and then let go when they found out that he was innocent and no one got hurt. A few days after he got out of prison my dad called my stepmother so that he could talk to me. The conversation went something like this (D= Dad. Me= Me)

D:  Hi, son I want to let you know that I'm ok and that I am out of prison now so if you want to talk, I'm here for you.
Me: Ok dad, can I come live with you though.
D: Buddy listen, you cant come and live with me now because I have to work all day and you're only 8, which means that you cant look after yourself.
Me: Yea I can, I'm a big boy.
D: i know you are buddy, but no means no. I am so sorry son, go put me on the phone with mummy and remember I love you very very much.

Little did I know that giving that phone to my stepmother would set off this bomb that was my abusive step father.

After I gave my phone and went downstairs to play with my legos. My ASF (abusive step father) came in to the room I was in and punched me in the back of the head. (He has no problems with alcoholism or a mental health disorder) and he said to me ""Dont you ever talk to that disgusting wife beater again, DO YOU HEAR ME."" 
Me: [crying] ""y-yes""
ASF: ""If I ever hear you speaking to him again I will hit you ten times harder""
Me: ""N-no please dont""

[I am already starting to tear up, and I am just going to tell you all of the significant times and the times that I am constantly being haunted by, because of PTSD]

Time #1: Me and ASF were walking into town to get some groceries, but to get to the town we have to cross this field of grass which is about a mile long. Me and ASF were having a chat (I was 8/9 at the time and I didnt know what he was like). I must have said something that offended him because he started to strangle me and did not let go until I almost passed out.

Time #2: for a few weeks now, I had been going over to my dads every weekend because he was free on the weekends and we both wanted to see eachother. One week though my dad had bought me a new book about trains and when I bought that book home ASF took one look and the cover, saw that it said dad on the cover and then started to hit me with the book. (I was about 10 at the time).

Time #3: ASF had been abusing me on numerous occasions and when my dad saw the bruises on my arms, he asked me about them and I told him about ASF He took me down to the police station to tell my story, the police say the will look into it, but later my dad got a text saying that they can't look into the case because I was only a kid and that I was just making stuff up. This had a huge impact on me and now I have trust issues 

Time #4: ASF had hit me so many times that I was so scared of him, and I was excited to go into school because that was my only getaway during the weekdays. I have tried telling my stepmother and school about it but they all just said the same thing ""that I am just a kid, and I am making stuff up"". I went home extremely upset because no one seemed to believe my story, even when I had the marks to justify my points. At this time I went into the kitchen and saw a huge kitchen knife on the table, just left there and so I grabbed it by the handle and pointed it at my throat. My stepmother was just walking into the kitchen when she saw me with the knife, bawling my eyes out. She rushed over to me grabbed the knife out of my hands and said ""dont be so stupid, nothing has happened to you to make you want to kill yourself.""

Time #5: ASF asked me to do something for him, so I tried standing up to myself and said ""no, do it yourself"".
As soon as I hear him shout ""WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY TO ME"" whilst just walking into my room, I immediately regretted it. He grabbed me, put me into the firemans carry position and walked me into the kitchen and shoved a bottle of washing up liquid into my mouth, he just kept holding it down causing it to empty into my mouth, leaving me with a mouthful of washing up liquid, which he then forced me to swallow it and then he did the same thing, filled my mouth and made me swallow it. Three times he did that three times.

Time #6: I was at school, we were in a PE lesson when I accidentally pushed a girl over and she grazed her leg. School called my house phone where of course ASF had to answer it. I walked home and as soon as I opened the door ASF snatched me slammed the door closed, grabbed me by the throat so I couldn't breathe raised me up to the ceiling and then dropped me. I hit my head on the floor causing me to bleed and he left me there. I still have the scar from where I fell and hit the floor.

Time #7: I was doing my homework when my pen exploded. I asked ASF if I could have a spare but then he got pissed because I apparently did something to make the pen explode, when I told him that i didn't do anything to the pen he got pissed and threatened to kill me by ""throwing me outside the top floor window and stomping on my head"" at that time my dad had met a new girlfriend and had a place with two bedrooms so I immediately ran outside with my phone and called up my dad and I said that i will be there soon. I ran all night, I ran all the way to my dads house which was like 5 miles away and then my dads girlfriend made me move in with them. I will be forever thankful to her because it felt like all of the pain had just stopped. But then a couple of months later I got sent to the doctors where I got diagnosed with Depression, PTSD, anxiety and bipolar disorder. 

That is all I can write down because there are some stuff that I cant say because I will immediately burst out crying, like the time ASF got my pet dog to rape me. (I know that It sounds weird and like a lie but it isnt. I was there pinned down while he watched, laughing while I was left feeling hopeless).

I fled my home March 18th to get away from an increasingly tense situation in which I felt unsafe. I won't go into details at this time but note there is destruction of property, financial abuse, verbal abuse, and public humiliation.  Today, at the advice of my counselor to be sure I am covering my bases, I let him know I will be getting my belongings from the home with the help of others, including my cats. I suggested he go to breakfast with his family so that they're not disturbed and I would leave the key there when I leave. 

He sent back an ugly text saying that I would not be allowed into the home that I am still on the lease for, that I would be taken to court for ""committing libel and slander"", and that I would not be allowed to have my pets because I ""abandoned"" them when I fled. 

The kicker is the exact phrasing is what I used to tell our landlords what happened. Either he managed to look at my emails to them, or more than likely, they disclosed what is said to him since I have been fighting them (along with my advocates) to be released from the lease. So now I'm having a full blown panic attack but I calmly send back that they're my cats and he will not keep all three pets (we had two cats and a dog, and he decided to keep the dog). I also stated I will get a police escort if need be.

Since he works for the jail, he thinks he is above the law and the only authority on legal matters. He then told me the police will not help because it is a civil matter. 

I did not respond to him beyond that and instead called the crisis line for my DV organization. I got hold of someone who helped me and who told me to leave a message for my advocate. I did, stating what I knew at that time. Now I see he also changed the password to my account somehow for the rent which has access to my direct checking account.

For several months I’ve heard a male voice coming from my neighbor’s apartment absolutely screaming his head off. Extremely profane. Says “my wife” as he’s yelling a lot so I assume it’s a husband-wife living there. I’ve called the cops whenever he has said anything that sounded like it would lead to self-harm or if I ever heard the woman scream, but they never follow up with me after and it doesn’t seem to help. I finally got apartment management involved but their only solution is to terminate their lease if they continue causing disturbances. 

I don’t feel comfortable getting directly involved since I’m a small woman. And while I’ve never personally met the neighbors, the man came to our door and intimidated my roommate one of the times we called the cops. He also beats directly on his ceiling (literally shaking our floors) and screams at us if we are “walking too loud”, but we are very quiet people, and he does it even when we’re sitting quietly eating/working, so I suspect he hears things. So he has been extremely hostile to us and I’m concerned for the safety of the woman in his apartment.

I also don’t know the whole situation, sometimes he screams about her abusing him. But the screaming happens at all hours of the day and night and I’ve lost a ton of sleep to it and need it to stop. I feel scared to walk around my own apartment or walk by their floor.

It just baffles me... I am in control of my decisions , I know that... And I choose to stay because I still have ""hope"" but I think that anybody that judges without being in this situation first, should hold their judgments but I'd never think I'd be the one judged for what HE does to ME. lmao
